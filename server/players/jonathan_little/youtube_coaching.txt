[Document(page_content="everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assassin Otto doing another one of my webinars for Jonathan little today we are going to be discussing exploitative continuation bet sizing refining our basics why should you change your bout sizes why you should change your best sizes 90 plus percent of your opponents in an HP tea or in low stakes cash games have no idea who you are they are generally playing their hand and not getting too calibrated versus players like this you can manipulate them with some basic bat changes today I'm going to show you how to exploit basic regulars so you can make more money so the truth is guys with the vast majority of opponents they're more or less playing their cards in their fixed strategy and if you know what those fixed strategies tend to be and they tend to be the same ones all over the world just because people tend to learn poker the same way you can manipulate them somewhat so we're gonna talk about that today but what about balancing is something a lot of people asked Melanson is important when you're playing against higher level opponents I I was lucky enough to make a final table in Prague at the butt end of 2016 for example and there I had to do a lot of balancing because versus very educated opponents there's no seed betting 100% of the time but it's also important to be balancing when you play the same people every day NNW so key to Kaizen hire you a euro one case and higher in cash games will require require balancing just because you're gonna be playing against the same people every day but for the vast majority of people you'll only get so many hands with them it's gonna be about 40 or 50 and if they've never really seen you and that that has to go with cash games or tournaments as well if they've never really seen you in those 40 and 50 hands they're gonna have their way they're gonna react and that's gonna be it and we can manipulate them this playbook I use this playbook often when I'm playing against people the first time it's been very useful at stateside wptz up to 3.5 Kay's and most tournaments in Vegas the higher stakes of the nations that that's when people start attacking your cbats a little bit more and obviously W some PD two K's and higher it works great in tournaments up to $200 weekday tournaments in online tournaments so online if you're playing Sunday majors you're fine but if you're playing up to 109s during the weekdays you're fine but those 160 to 200 dollar daily tournaments that that's where people start attacking you online so I wouldn't use this stuff as much there and again it has to do with the player base if it's a very educated player base which is more rare than people realize they're going to be attacking see that's quite frequently but the vast majority of even regs that make a little money the way they make their money is they open when people are unlikely to three about them they three bet when people are unlikely to for about them and they have a pretty good seed betting strategy themselves if they call you from the big blind for example maybe they're just looking to hit a piece of flop and that's where we can get a little something but there's different ways to go about this let's let's take a look at let's take a look at a hypothetical situation so here you have ten seven of diamonds on the bottom you raise to two-and-a-half times the big one the big line calls you the board comes eight clubs four diamonds three of spades it gets chucked to you of these options which one would you like to take all right you're gonna get a few extra seconds because I had a little technical difficulty there somebody in the chest chat asked what is an HP T that was an example of a mid stakes poker tour in the United States that's the Heartland Poker Tour mid stakes poker tour W so PC all of those apply this will apply in so we got a wide range of answers in the chat which I'm gonna put away right now he's my ad D prevents me from reading and talking at the same time up you could even bet larger why do you think we should bet larger there so the the first one we're gonna analyze is betting 66 to 75 percent pop and you'll notice most people bet half pot but I put 66 or 75 now why is that let me ask you something one of you continuation bet here what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important that anyone want to guest in the chat what the most important thing is to think of here all right I see if few people got it now the reason guys i kamerad on this so much so i long story short i put together a playbook for my students that was very successful with a lot of that and then with certain students who are just as smart as the other ones i noticed they weren't being as successful and that really confused me because some of these guys were so intelligent I wasn't even in their zip code and eventually so I did some reading I was trying to figure out why do people why can people perform well when they study enduring simulations but not so much in the field in something I found that was shared by a lot of elite performers is the focus on one two or three items so Navy SEALs for example in those guys some of them are multilingual demolition experts bodybuilders right like if there's anybody who can remember anything it would be those guys well when they're when they go into the field they only are given one two or three things to remember if any of you follow American football Bill Belichick the head coach of the New England Patriots probably the most successful dynasty of all time in the NFL when he is at halftime and he's giving people things to remember for the second half he has a rule that it has to be three things it can't be more than three things it can be one thing to thing or three things but it can't before and I find we get more results in no-limit hold'em when we focus on specific thoughts okay because let's be honest we've all looked at this situation a hundred times before and there's a lot of things to look at one person in the chat said could he possibly check-raise me what am I trying to set up on the turn and River does that board hit his range or my range more all of that stuff is great but we can start with one thought that if we understand this question and the answer of it it makes everything else superfluous not as big of a deal that's where we should start from now obviously if you get a more complex opponent you do have to broaden out the thoughts you are thinking to become a little bit more exacting in your ways but for the vast majority of poker hands we don't have to go that can complicate it I still use what we're going to talk about here even in Atlantic City WPTZ and what not so you want to see that too foldout high cards the biggest question to ask yourself here is how can I get rid of the high cards and I bet a lot of you answered that you were saying how can I get him to just fold with when he missed this board yeah hi car it's okay different phrasing but the same thing now here's my question you want to see that to fold out high cards right well betting half pot do that if you know tell me because I don't know a lot of guys will call with their ace highs of any kind with a half pot bat when there's two-wheel cards out there others will hold it's a little more likely actually much more likely they'll fold if I bet bigger and obviously less likely they'll fold if I bet smaller let's say I've got this much 450 how often does this need to work guys what do you do mathematically to figure out how often this works this is one of the first things I learned when I started learning poker very beginning this is the beginning of your poker studies well you do 450 the amount you're risking divided by the pot you're gonna get back when he folds because that 450 doesn't go off into the ether it comes back to you if you're right any fold so you do 450 divided by 1080 here and you're gonna find that your bet is a complete Bluff needs to work 41.6 repeating percent of a time and if anybody is a little puzzled why it's an uneven number there remember the ante is 10 here so the reason you bet this large is because if you get the guy to fold high cards on most boards without two cards nine or higher then you're printing money let me say that that was a little confusing if the board does not have two cards nine are higher then generally the person has mostly high cards if you get him to fold those high cards almost any bet up to the size of the pot will be profitable many basic players will fall for the tactic I just showed you their whole life they have seen half pot sized bats you put out a slightly larger bet a lot of guys will go huh that's weird and then they muck their high card which isn't what we want that's it we're not expecting them to fold pears that's a big ask but maybe just a beer raised right that doesn't have a God shot hell I still have guys in WPTZ that fall for this tactic guys I would not teach it to you if I did not use it myself and this is something you can bring out all the time with satellite winners or like okay rags that are used to dealing with half pot size bets oh if you're uh if you're an older gentleman or lady they're just gonna think you have them nuts what do you bet bigger actually if they fold you should applied you should beef that up right after they fold just go I hate pocket jacks or something like that that is an awesome image to have now if you had to pick another answer here which one would be there is one other exploitative plight here which will requires a bit more finesse does anyone know what it is Carlos says I'm not able to see other people's comments Carlos that's because people are writing in the questions tab and that's not a community thing Roy is my timer being so named there I got okay guys just so you know we're just got a note that says we're at a capacity crowd here so congratulations guys that's my first capacity crowd all right time is up one second guys I'm fighting with the webinar you would bet 33% of the pot now so let's say you've got 200 here into 6:30 and he calls the turn is the Queen of Hearts now what do you do love how active you guys are in the chat okay into this you are lot of different answers here too which is great because it shows this isn't common poker wisdom it's not something we discuss about all right you would met just a little over half pot anything over half pot would be good why would I do that well let's go back to the flop when we bet that small and he calls what do you think he is calling with what do we think he's calling with let's make this a group activity well now he's probably calling me with all of his ace highs because come on guys we all fall for this tiny bat we have a high card we feel weak folding I know all about this plan I'll tell you what if I have ace 7 ear and someone bets 200 I feel really silly folding but the problem is what happens if the guy calls with a sigh we all fall for this tiny bet we have a high card we feel weak folding and that's when we get them or that's when they get us rather because that turn comes and it's anything but an ace and we fire anything slightly above half podna it looks like we're trying to get value now so we're betting 550 here to win 1580 our bed needs to work as a pure Bluff 35% of the time so we're gonna round up so what does that mean what's the next thing I'm going to say guys if our bet needs to work as a pure Bluff 35% of the time what does that mean for our opponent let's see if anyone puts it in the chat yes amy was the first one and see Louise okay see who I love how you guys have the fundamental he needs to defend with 65% of his hands however if we threw a queen out there and look at the statistics we find that he doesn't even have a pair 45 percent of the time which means even if he defends with every pair and draw he's not defending 65% of his hands he's only defending 55 percent of his hands I love this play because most guys will call with a high card or a gun shot once versus a small bet because probably they should but then on the turn when they miss and you fire a quote substantial bet out there they'll let it go what they don't realize is they're getting worked I totally did I totally just did air quotes when I said the word substantial by the way if you guys could see all right one more guys I don't have much time today so I'm going to have to be brief there's one other bet you can do here I only use it maybe 10 percent of the time but I'll use it with a young guy who's getting angry with me I love these in Planet Hollywood tournaments small events in Europe WSOP see events let's see if you can get this this also works on online too you get a lot of lol's in the chat all right guys what do you think it is I'm not giving you any training wheels you got a guess today a lot of people guessing min bet one person guests check one person guests over bet what do you think it is my key goes whatever it is don't check all right time is up you can just bend a little 850 there into the pot of 630 so you bet 850 guys how do I figure out how often this needs to work if this were poker 101 this is the first thing that would teach you you do 850 divided by fourteen eighty that means our bet as a pure Bluff needs to work 57 percent of the time so what does that mean guys for our opponent I'm gonna pause here for a second if you haven't thought about it think about it it means he needs to defend with 43 percent of his hands the problem is if he defends with any pair that's only 35 percent of his range this is a fun for those of you who are familiar with baseball I call this the change-up just because nobody expects it you get with young guys I love this play because you get a lot of poop and then they fold which is fine I'm I'm fine looking dumb right but it's been a long time since I did this bet and somebody figured out what I was doing and they decided to raise or something because most the time in the states I don't know why this is but most people as long as you don't leave them looking stupid duffle that's at low in middle stakes and if it's like a WPT in baltimore that's a lot of satellite winners and stuff like that right despite it being more substantial buy and it's gonna be people that generally play five hundred and four hundreds and stuff like that so as long as you're not as long as you're allowing them to save face they'll usually let it go and in this case in common poker parlance you're kind of seen is the nut case here so it's not really on them to feel silly some final notes guys everything we looked at had to do with the big blind calling you we started with that situation because it is the most common continuation betting setting in No Limit Hold'em do not do these bet sizes versus a cold caller I'm going to repeat that do not do these bet sizes versus a cold caller a 12% cold calling range is much different than a 35% big blind flatting range so this is a common misconception that comes up every time I teach this which is o betting really big to fold out high cards is good versus the big blind calling you I guess it's pretty good all the time well I'm really glad that you understand now that the big blind calls with too many hands and is on most boards is gonna have mostly high cards and you can get away with a really big bet but that's because they're calling with 35 40 percent of hands almost regardless of where you raised that's why we're focusing on that spot to begin with which is go count the number of times the big blind calls you and assist you in him in any medium stakes tournament it's gonna be 30 40 50 of your final hands by the end of the tournament so you really need to have that spot down now if somebody cold calls you a mid position this is a much more rare spot because usually if somebody cold calls you in the mid position now the big lines gonna flat you so it's a multi-way pot in which case you should not see that as a complete Bluff because the majority of the time both players have not have not missed but if you were to get cold called in the blindfolded the cold caller only has like 12% of hands that is a third of the hands the big blind has do not fire big a buddy of mine was nice enough to start telling me it to start teaching me what the solvers say the solvers are much bigger on small bats versus the cold calling ranges but to make sure that these large bat sizes are a good idea I've been taking lessons on GTO solvers and we've been testing bigger bats this is just something I pulled from the website by the way so look read too much into this versus big lines versus big line calling ranges they do look pretty good the bigger bets the solver does not say that though about c-betting into cold calling ranges that's a more varied approach it approach a much more nuanced approach what boards should i attack uh this guy's I would take a screenshot of if if you would like to what boards should i attack ace high boards should get a small bet because he's either got the ACE or he doesn't so I know it's tempting to read this really quickly as I'm talking guys but I'd really encourage you just to listen to me right now because we're gonna go through a bunch of different boards and how you can attack them since I don't have that much time today I I'm gonna go through this a little bit more briefly than I would prefer to but this stuff is very important so on an ace-high board what is the most exploitative way to play well when you have a really good ace bet 80% of the pot because if he has an ace he's not folding ever and that pot is gonna be so big by the river and he's gonna have a really hard time folding right and if he has second pair what usually people do when they have second pair on an ace eye board is they'll call they'll call flop and they'll full term because they assume the second time you fire you have the ACE so that first bat should be really big now if you have nothing and again this guy doesn't know you from Adam and or this is just someone you don't play with every day or somebody you're running into in a tournament what you can do is bet like 1/3 pot because that bet needs to work 25% of the time but that means your opponent needs to defend 75% of the time that is very unlikely to happen the really good thing about a sideboards is there's no way for your opponent to have over cards so they usually just have the ACE or they don't have it and if they do have something like 10 9 there's no way for that to be over cards or anything so any bet will use fold them out unless of course they picked up like a gunshot and backdoor draw or something but the vast majority of a cold-calling range and the big blind is not going to have that two cards nine or higher should also receive a small bet so people tend to cold-call with high cards they don't call with medium cards they don't they don't really like low cards it's some medium cards and a lot of high cards so when you see a board with two cards that are nine or higher that tends to be a little bit covering the cold-calling range right so here's the thing on those boards let's say the board comes king/queen to a lot of the same things apply that apply on ace high boards the person has a really hard time having high cards the only high card there is an ace so there's not we don't have to worry about big combo drawers having to price them out the person usually has a king or a queen or they don't so again a very small bet will work if let's say the person cold-called you in middle position that might not be the best board to see that because that is all over the person's cold-calling range right you might want to back off there but in the big blind there's still enough like nine six suited x' and ten eight off suits in order to justify a small bet maybe not half pot uh three cards nine or below with no straight draw can handle any of the bets we saw today that is one of my favorite boards I like to sucker people in with that really small bat yet though like okay I don't know what you're doing call and then get them to fold on the term because that's just an extra 200 ships in my pocket and if you ratchet that up if you collect those throughout the day in a tournament that's going to add up to let's say nine big blinds at the end of a tournament that doesn't sound like much but everybody listening to this has likely come back from nine big blinds at some point in a tournament and made a really serious run of it if they didn't win the tournament so having that extra nine big blinds is like having a second life and tournament poker and as you can imagine if everybody else enters the turn with one life and you have two lives that's excellent so these are the fun most fun boards to manipulate you can throw in that over bet if you have a pissy young kid you can just go for the bigger bad if you just want to spell it out for them you can sucker them in with that small bet and then a big bet one Broadway to low cards can handle the same thing generally alright so that's like king X ax clean X ax Jack X X now if you have a nine in there right if it starts putting flush and straight draws out there you might not want to get as cute with the small bed but generally the bigger bets will work but yeah if it's just king for two again you can do the over bet you can do the one third pot size bet you can do two-thirds pot size back and flush or straight boards this is something I don't hear talked about enough but flushers straight boards are great for double barrels so get some money in the middle on the flop you that is one of the very few situations I really like a half pot bet because what happens is is someone has a pair of any type on a flush draw board or straight job board they're still gonna call if you fire the see bet they're just gonna hope like hell if the card comes out there on the turn that you're just gonna give up so you fire half pot the person's gonna miss the board enough on three to a su as long as it doesn't have to card sign or hire three to a suit or three to a straight 765 they're going to have missed enough to justify the half pot size bed but if they do call in the turn is an 8 on the 765 board are the turn is a fourth heart on the three heart board what happens is they have missed that turn and they did not make a draw 60% of the time minimum so pretty much any bed out there is going if you think is gonna fold out the pair's is going to turn a profit so you can fire a little bit more substantially and just pocket what they put in on the so the problem I find when you bet one third pot on those boards is you kind of tell the person I don't have a big hand because if you think about it if the board came 765 and you had a set of six is you really it's really unlikely you'd be betting one third pot because you'd be justifiably a bit worried about a straight draw coming in right so if you bet half pot it still looks like you could have a little something and then you get to pick up a little extra money when you bet the turn alright guys that is exactly how much time I had hey guys thank you for tuning in today I know your time is valuable so it means a lot to me that you would

are also good targets for the strategy we're using against the big blind yes Joe you need to make sure they don't limp big hands though so typically if the person's under 50 years old you're fine right cuz young guys just won't try that play even though that play can work pretty well I have a buddy of mine who makes that play work really well when there's a kid at the table or just I so is everything and yeah he's good with it uh Mike says can we get a webinar on heads up or near the end of the turn II would like to know more on shoving and calling in those situations Mike actually float the turn as a really good app on shoving and if you want to win more tournaments heads up just play your big pots in position Mike says hey Alex I just want to say a huge thanks for answering all my emails happy to be of service Mikey this is my day job and I have a pretty awesome job playing poker and teaching about poker so it's really honestly my pleasure somebody wrote in Enzo care haha Ralph will says master tournament poker in one class is really refined my opening ranges in overall game in a downswing but feel like I'm not giving my tourney away like I did in the past which is a huge step thanks about you're welcome well so if you guys are unfamiliar with my coaching I do do quite a bit of the hand quizzes the interactive quizzes that you would get by accessing poker coaching comm slash lucky the way I teach people how to play poker is attacking poker and it's attacking poker with some analytics some comm unit or X so a lot of the fundamentals I find the way we teach poker be really silly I was really lucky in that I learned poker like everybody else in the States from like the training sites and everything back in 2006 and in 2007 to this day I don't know how this happened but a bunch of Germans took me in in Malta and just getting to be around how they thought about poker I learned a new set of fundamentals and my life has pretty much been awesome ever since and the way they teach are the the stuff we were studying at that time I I don't even know they're very modest guys if how much they would claim is their own idea but it was very much attacking poker and it came from the chess world I think which is if you watch an intermediate chess hustler he's just a very attacking guy right and then you'll see people just get worked over in any game and be a boxing or chess when they're just waiting for something to happen right where is if you go on the attack a lot of good things can happen and if you can skillfully go on the attack you're not going to be giving away your tournaments as we'll just discuss there you're going to be putting yourself in situations to win I just got a tweet actually I've been getting a number of tweets from guys just talking about I can feel that I'm the actor now I'm the one changing the tournament I'm the one putting myself in position to win that's great that's awesome Jonathan says how would you adjust your strategy for live cash games I would well honestly poker is pretty much poker if people are reacting the same way now and a lot of cash games you raise from a knee position you're not getting in the big blind it's gonna be seven way to the pot which is fine you just got a plate para better poker but if you're in the button are the cutoff and you think your opponent is just gonna call you with that wide range it's the same thing do you thank Steve asks do you think a low percentage of players limp with began such as aces and Kings it tends to be a pretty low number when I did try to research that it was pretty hard to find willsez how can I get one-on-one training from you will write me at Alex at poker head rush calm I'm actually I just don't have time for one-on-one poker training anymore I'm kind of finishing with the students I have and that's gonna be it but yeah if you you know if you write me I can put you on the waiting list and I can see what I can do it's unfortunately I don't think I can get anybody and it's just it's things have been really busy lately Chuck says at the start of the tournament what do you look for to assess your opponents that's a really good question Chuck Chuck the way you're gonna learn most about your opponent's show up 15 minutes before the tournament drink your coffee and watch their IDs as they go to the dealer especially if you're in Europe you'll get to see every country they're from and in the United States there's different hotbeds of poker so if the guys from California if the guys from Las Vegas if the guys from Atlantic City if you're just looking at the driver's licenses and you see that more likely this guy plays cards every day if this guy's from Timbuktu if this guy's from trying to think Walla Walla Washington it's a little less likely he's playing high-caliber competition every day right and a lot of times it'll say like their address and stuff like that right so if you get a quick look right just act like you're stretching that's why your eyes are going that way you can get a little bit about that and then uh young guys tend to be a little feisty but don't want to look stupid come on it's kind of harder with the older clientele because they're learning to attack a little bit more above there another great way to think about it is the less effort they're trying to show they're pushing the more likely they are to play aggressively essentially if a person dresses up to go play poker or please person dresses presenta bleah that means poker is still a big event in their lives that means it's a little bit more likely to be a recreational player or a very very intelligent pro if the person shows up dressed like fried dog turns you know just a like I dress better in my living room and some of these guys do showing up at a tournament and that's so bad if a recreational player turns up there but yeah you know the basketball shorts they've pissed all over and the graphic hoodie and it's pulled over and they haven't shaven in three days that guy probably wants you to know what an amazing Pro he is right so that guy is a little bit more likely to attack your see that's how if a guy just shows up in jeans and like an okay sweater or something like that that that doesn't really tell you much but if the guy's trying to show you how awful you can show up at the table that's one thing Oh Ralph wrote a very long one let's see if we can get to this Ralph Alex I have one question I'm running into one problem earlier tournament after I crush it 100 plus big blinds triple upend first three rounds how much do you tighten up or do you this problem lately I could email if you don't have time today thank you for the webinar thank you this has happened so much lately am I just running bad I think I need to become super tight is that wrong nope that is wrong uh let me tell you you ever watch a horse race number one a horse race will show you the very natural progression of a race which is the person whose album the lead at the beginning a lot of the time is not going to be there at the end I mean this happens in all sorts of races right happens a lot in distance where the guy who just burns out at the beginning everybody's just laughing at and then come like mile five on the marathon he starts finding out why that was such a bad idea but if you do get out to that lead the idea is until that everybody else catch up uh uh look guys I don't play as much live poker anymore I like internet poker I like live people kind of know who I am they going after me a little bit I also just don't have this much time traveling to travel as I used to a date out of this office does cost me a decent amount of money right and but when I do play live poker I just love it because I'm lucky enough to have run deep a lot of times in the last few years even though I only get to play like five live tournaments a year whereas before it was like 10 15 20 lucky enough to run really deep in some tournaments WPT Atlantic City I finished in the 20s or something out of the thousand runners or whatever it was in the main event I final table WPT Prague I finished in like the 20s or something and WPT Montreal got another final table in Montreal had a wcp main event run and it was all very fun but what people don't see is there's a lot of times like Ralph I get a big stack at the beginning and I am nowhere to be found in eight hours because the truth is if there is profit on the table and you got to take it because you get a finite number of hands and no limit hold'em right and at the beginning of the tournament those chips are is that is this close to a cash game it's ever going to be right and a lot of times at the beginning at tournaments people are just opening whatever the hell they want just 3bet them take them to school corner them why do they think they can open in front of you if they're if you're gonna three bad they're just gonna go hurry up and they're gonna call you out of position with their entire range it's just a wide open lane it might bite you in the ass a lot of the time but that's okay so what happens guys this is what happens when I play tournaments I have more fun than anybody I know when I go to Las Vegas because this is what happens one I'm either there in day four with a ton of chips having a lot of fun or three hours after I started the tournament I'm going to the movies so guess what happens after two or three weeks of playing tournament poker guess who's not that tired everybody else though they do this crap when they show up to a live tournament okay gotta do my best behavior right time to play great poker and then act like and I'm talking about like intermediate guy your studies poker guy who knows about poker I'm not talking about average Potter but this is what a lot of guys do who really care about poker is they resolve to play their best game which translates to their tightest game which means they made a two with no chips consistently are they barely cash which means by the end of three weeks in a tournament they are dead tired because they have not gone one day off but they never have chips and they're always grinding a short stack and it's the same binary action shove or fold every single time if they are going to keep opening garbage you must 3bet them if they are going to keep limping garbage you must isolate them if one guy is gonna keep opening everything and another person is going to keep calling everything you must squeeze them you will go out of tournaments early that is not a problem that is a symptom of trying that shows you're going for it all the Dead Money goes dead the middle of day two Chris would come ask do you jam 10:10 to an open raise from early position with effective stacks of 40 big blinds from a somewhat active player already in the money 25 left left um uh to an open ways for me to pay you with effective size of 40 big behind but you're probably okay Chris but I need more information if it's a somewhat active player and I'm pretty sure I can put it in I think you're okay but I think you can three bet another thing you can do there Chris it's just like two axes open because most guys won't form a back with nine nine that's a very exploitative plane that could go very wrong with really good opponents but the vast majority of players will not know what you do oh yeah oh let's see and see your question is a little too hard to summarize here so somebody asked a question like how do you close out tournaments I was lucky enough to recently talk with a friend of mine who has made a million dollars profit from online tournaments and I got to watch his biggest one and see how he did it and the thing I noticed is when he's out of position he doesn't care and if he like has a pair and somebody raises him post-flop and he doesn't like the Spotty's to stop he doesn't care but when he's in position and he likes the pot I never seen a guy ham or more Hill free bet you everything every size he can just to get the three bet on you and he will value bet every single time viciously and I I think that type of execution is how you finish out tournaments because then you come into final tables with mortar with more chips which means technically you're going to win more tournaments than the other person let's see Joshua asks how many of the poker hand poker coaching hand quizzes their tournament cash hands I know John is talking to new people to get new hand quizzes in I think they're working more on cash I to be honest with you guys I'm not absolutely sure as to the exact percentages so I don't want to say Darrell says on the dry rainbow cardboard where we bet three for spot how should we proceed if we get called against either a low turn card or high turn Darryl asked a really good question let me teach you something that I really wish somebody taught me when I play poker when you see that what everybody when you asked why did you see back there they'll say to fold out you know what he meant okay great somebody calls you what does he have on the turn he's got pears it's like it's all pears this actually came up in one of my poker hit coaching hand quizzes recently which was I was just showing the eye I was just showing that like 70% of most year guys flatting ranch is gonna be pear so you need to know what a pair does on the turning River and the truth is low stakes guys don't ever want to fold their pears mid stakes the eyes will fold their pears if another over card comes that isn't likely to fill them in and their pear originally was just garbage but if their pair was anything after IDs and they're not folding by the way guys this coupon expires Sunday March 24 2009 teen I forgot to mention that so i quick david says will you be at shocked out for the WPT I'm not oh you're making me cry David no I have a life project I've been working on and I told myself no poker till it was done I'm very sad because I love playing poker I love my job I still love playing card it always makes me mad when you hear poker pros go like snooty snooty snoot snoot like I don't like I don't really like playing poker that's well I do it I'd love to be out in Choctaw for you guys I got a few like projects to finish thinking it's just going I just wanna play more you know that's a great thing about the internet you just you turn it on you go right doesn't matter where you are in the world you can make all the money tomorrow be walking down the block and new art New Jersey Mike Moore says you've always bang on about the fundamentals how do you determine what you need to study at any given time Mikey I'd really work on c-betting theory I'd really work a 3-betting theory I'd really work on opening theory and like I'll give you the analytics answer most of your opens will be profitable if knowing three bets you so that this is basic stuff late position opens a king if you're on the cuff though and you have a button who's just not awake you should be opening a lot of stuff you normally don't open like I don't open King deuce suited from the cutoff like 90% of the time but if I've got a button in a live tournament who's indicating when he's gonna fold his hand I might just open that from the cutoff right getting better at your oaken's is a really big deal finding out one is it unlikely people are in a three bet you hint small blind big blind never three bit enough certain buttons will not people have tells ostentatious behavior tends to mean they're folding if they look at their hand preflop three bang theory if a guy opens more than 20 25% of the hands and you three bad and he doesn't for bet nine times out of ten he's screwed see betting theory we a lot of the stuff we just went over and then turn betting Theory Riverbend in theory it's pretty much he has a pair most guys don't want to fold them if you have a better pair keep firing don't stop until he tells you not to fire any more until he raises you and if you can't beat a pair find a way to get them to fold a pair and that's not gonna happen too often unless a four flush comes out there four straight comes out there are a number of draws Andover cards come out there Bob Mitchell says I really struggled with aggression on flops where I have a flush and a straight draw especially open ended or I know I'm a favorite even to a set but it seems like it rarely works out regardless of the line I take thoughts Bob I think you've just been stung lately which happens to everybody let's see you know guys you'll have entire years where things don't go well in poker because the truth is it's really hard to play enough ham one of the reasons I love online poker is I can play the 30 hands is about what you play in an hour in live poker I can play that in I can play five thousand ten thousand eight right so that lets say five thousand hands right let's say you play five thousand hands in a day let's just start four thousand hands okay in case I'm over shooting my case there just a bit you can play four thousand five thousand hands in an entire WSOP if you play every single about right so a lot of times people are like I'm just running bad I'm like well you played that situation four times it's like there's a pretty good likelihood you'd mess four times in a row right if you get on the internet and you grind your ass off you're gonna see yourself get through those swings if you're playing live though you just got to kind of keep your wits about you how do you keep your wits about you well you have a life away from the game a lot of guys forget to do that they have their day job they own their family but all they're thinking about is the game all the time one of the ways I think I've stayed around at the game went pro in 2006 it is 2019 now I'm doing Jeff's is fine is back then I have a real life outside of poker and that that's not because I don't love poker it's just you need a break it's perfect work right but if you've been thinking about that situation Bob if that happened and I mean this isn't your fault but let's say you busted out of three tournaments in a row with that that it would be very normal for you to be thinking about only that for a long time right but the problem is now you didn't play those hands four times you play them four thousand times your head and now you're convinced they never come it's not true buddy there's a book called Thinking Fast and Slow really recommend you check out your money in your brain extremely good to check out fooled by randomness anti fragile skin in the game all books by Anna seem Nicolas to lab I'll have all having to do with randomness and how the human mind deals with it yeah the answer is not well Keith said ask advice for combating button straddles when you were in the big blind or small blind played this weekend and when I was in the small blind abundant straddle every time Keith tuned into the Nets one of these webinars I'm gonna help you out short answers 3bet big and then they'll probably call you with 35% of hands and everything we just discussed is gonna be applicable and I'm just going I don't know how much time I have guys I don't know when my girlfriend has dinner done so I'm just kind of skimming for the questions that'll help people the most just want to say thank you you got some good stuff just picked up your book exploitative playing live poker it's a great book Thank You Omar it means a lot to me mike says how do you quiz yourself on accurately ranking upon its Mike I would just start with this is everything in poker guys just start small and it's gonna open up Ernest Hemingway acting just so you know this happens to everybody where it's just kind of decision paralysis Ernest Hemingway got to a point where he was just afraid to write it even when he was very successful and the way he would cajole himself into writing as he would say just write one true sentence that was it once he started you got going so just start with one read I would start with big blind flagging ranges just 45 40 35 clip out the big hands and see what you can do on each board I started with a cold calling range like 12% 13 and 14% this Sooni days is the Sunnah connectors the small pairs some of the suited Broadway's see what you can do with that I'd serve with a three betting range just put a couple Bluffs in there and mostly value and see what you can do with that and get a copy of flop Zilla I find my seed bed to generate a lot of folds which is great when I'm bluffing but I'm finding it hard to get value for my good hands should I be checking more flops with top pair plus or should I find more bluff since my opponents seem to be over folding um it seems like you have opponents Adam that are very much like a seed that means the hand when he checks it doesn't me man so a a pot controlling line and for those of you follow me you know I make fun of pot controlling lines a lot but a pot control line there would be just perfect that would work really round the problem is pot controlling lines just kind of you're in a game where people know how to attack see that's you're supposed to be doing it like thirty to forty percent of time but you tell people that they can check a pair and just play a small pond a lot of guys that are very risk-averse will turn that into they always check a pair but it doesn't sound like you're that type of person so I would work it in I was once told by one of the best poker players or I heard this from a poker player who's probably one of the best poker players that's ever walked the earth pot control lines were created by great players make good players suffer and what he meant what I gradually found out is just overuse about right there are times it's amazing there are games where people just they think the seed that means he got it and if you check they're like oh no he doesn't have it and they attacked her an attacker river and you just collect nicely there's other games where if you just see that every board they're gonna figure it out real quick so you've got to work in that Shack but a lot of times guys just want to fold their high cards and they have mostly high cards they use you fire Gregg are you considering board texture before attacking with the higher seabed sighs yes sir two cards Nayar higher I do not do it one card nine or higher that's not nice I will do it Doug Brown says you mentioned sometimes the difference between European and American players any generalities between say Maryland live circuit event and shocked I've never played in shock to us so I can't comment comment but Maryland they just don't like a false that's a lot of limbs so you got an eye so you got it you got an eye so big and you've got a three bet big to get one guy and then expect to get cussed out I got called every name in the book in Maryland but you got to go big like take whatever you think you need to go and go bigger oh you mentioned in the past that you're working on live poker 102 got an ETA for that mark I don't know when that's gonna happen because honestly live poker 101 with so much work and what people want me to do seems to be these very focused theory video news now not just the practice but I do have stuff for live poker that I'm repurposing for something else so all this stuff that was gonna go live poker wanted to we'll see the light of day so keep looking for that let's see and Jamie says can you do a webinar I'm left to do when he freed up from the small blind your big blind get called and missed the flop assuming your three that range is Tiger than these positions came to but not exploit by flying in position huh Jamie tune in for the next one of these I'll see what I can do of all this says great stuff Alex Alex are you living in Malta at the moment any plans to play a live tournament if all this I when I move to Malta that was 2007-2008 I want to say they did not know what a poker player was to let you know how long ago that was I left 2009 I was 221 I have not been back since I used to live in st. julian's I can't remember the name of the grocery store I used to live above what was that it wasn't it was a few blocks away from Potterville which I know you probably are familiar with but uh no I live in New York right now I live in Long Island City which is right across the water from Manhattan I'm really happy here sure as hell is not cheap but it's something they say in the United States at some point you have to live in New York you're supposed to live in California at one point you're supposed to live in New York at one point I'd been on the west coast enough that I wanted to change a pace and I just love the East Coast I love the East Coast with every fiber of my being I love I love New York City I have never been in a more fun city in my life there's something to do every single night here you meet people from all over the world you can get anywhere for two bucks it's just insane my mind has grown so much in this city just the number of people you meet they say when you travel the great thing about traveling is you have to confront yourself because you have to confront other people and you realize all the little biases you used to have and subtle prejudices and thoughts that you didn't really ever check before and [Music] they'll become fatally wounded when you travel because then you're staring at the face of someone who is quite human and you realize where you were biased before and in New York you just get that times a million every single time there is everybody here and you better get with it or you're out of here Chris says he ran up almost 300 big blinds and a $400 tourney using your three bet tricks that's what I like to hear Chris guys I can hear my girlfriend finishing dinner so I'm probably after rhyme let me see Carter Lewis you are welcome for writing your emails back Ralph said 150 now we're not good enough has nothing to do with the money it's all about the time there as far as me personal coaching I love personal coaching I get a lot of ideas from personal coaching I become a much better poker player and personal coaching I get to train a lot myself personal coaching because I've got I put you guys through the worst simulators on how and I have to know the answer but I'm working lately what kind of adjustments are you making facing opens from clear recreational fun players are you flatter more 3betting your normal range I got to see what they open they open a dry ace or like a suit of gap or something like that or just an unsuited broad way that I'm three betting if I don't see anything I'm just flatting okay it's really hard to know what a recreational putter opens Steve says it's a dangerous move to limp with aces and kings yes it is richard says lately seen a lot of people in BAE's King King all the way to the river and zoom is this just something people are doing that I have no idea [Music] Carlos says are you playing tournaments are you playing tournaments nowadays uh not as much as before I do like the anonymous Network goes on some places where people know where I am it turns into let's three about the poker coach and yeah all of me says Oh someone else where I'm located we just mr. zoll the towel I just just answered up I appreciate you asking that so I don't feel as if I just wanna rap do you have different percentages of how the field reacts based on by incisor is it more regional it tends to be more regional it's strangely regional but it tends to be like it essentially Vegas is different than the rest of the state it is is that Vegas and a layer different than the rest of the state right so like 1k and higher in Vegas you're gonna get some Gunners where is you can play a 3.5 K on the East Coast and you're usually okay unless you go to like let's say Montreal I would Montreal I'll be different because they have access to Poker Stars since like if you can imagine somebody who's able to practice piano six hours a day versus someone who can only practice piano half hour day who is going to become the better pianist within a few years and the thing is when people I have access to PokerStars combi not saying that's the softest sight on earth but they have a lot of ability to practice whereas for many people in the United States who don't want to play on an unregulated sight they feel the only option they have is live poker and that means they can only play very few hands let's see you guys I think I have to head out here just a second guys Scott said you said earlier that you opened very little these days and 3bet much more does this mean you are limping first and waiting for someone else to open so you can three about them that's a it's a very interesting play that's really hard to make work I have had that one blow up in my face numerous times but no what it means is I still open a lot of hands as long as I think they're gonna play well multi-way and I just assume it's gonna be a multi-way pot you can also go for a really big open in some games and then a lot of times it will just go around to the big blind who with the big blind and he feels like they just have to call now oh that could work too but if that doesn't work well [Music] god there's so many different ways to approach that Scott you're talking about the stuff I have the most fun with so the other thing you can do is like 2x if there's a guy that just never stops the rebodied and then everybody calls and then that the dork squeezer will squeeze there then you can just min 4x and what they'll do is they'll just call like really quick when they don't have it and what they do have that they have to think about it because obviously they have to decide whether to trap or find out and then you just cleared everybody out and you got the dork with the jack 7 suited all to yourself with all this dead money but again that's a really hard one to pull off warlock says isolating when you have an open limper and three-plus lengthy hines is brutal i go to one expert limper plus 3.5 x the big blind it's still lined up being multi way I can't go larger without committing way too much of my stack which is in a fact they of shove on any pair that are gonna limp behind what this happens are just fire largely over if you can short stack my warlock and it even 40 X is what I'm talking about you could actually affect a very good Jam there in a lot of those and then you can just keep God hold on I'm trying to sorry girlfriends about to call me so I think I've gone over time already I usually just fire a large and go for it though is the thing and there there are some wonderful opportunities for short stackers they're really recommend you get a copy of card runners TV and play with that it's really easy to program James I'm Carter Busey baby is it's just everybody has to fold or Jam on top I mean not easy to take some time but it you'll find if people just don't limp in a big hand which is there are games where people like wear that on their faces they'll tell it to you to your faith you can really work that okay Ralph says he loves this thank you thanks for doing the webinar how do I just two players who like to raise my seed beds bet only four value three deaf to them um usually the typical raising range I've found most people will not raise less than two pair one of the hardest things as a coach is teaching people to raise a pair for value and trying to get them to bluff is very difficult as well and I used to think well that's only because I'm dealing with very dedicated players now that I've talked to thousands upon thousands and poker players I realized people just don't like to raise with nothing they really don't like to raise with pairs because if they get three bit back it's a crap what do I do now right so it tends to be two pair more so nine times out of ten it's all in your head William if people are raising as a bluff but now if you do have someone who has like let's say a check raise of like 20% or more our arrays seemed out of like 20% or more well now something you can do is kind of track what boards they like guys tend to have their type of board like a quote some guys really like dry boards some people really like coordinated boards no caddy will actually keep track of every time they do it for you so you can just watch on a replay is so that's really neat and then if you figure out their board just you know the other thing if you can watch the replay as you can see if anybody ever 3bet them and they fold and that that's their board nine times at the time and then you should three that and mommy says I bought my use Tommy Bahama vacation shoots for we're gonna do good w so pay God love you that's awesome Lonnie what adjustments do I have to make if any of the later stages of the tournament oh my god Ricardo that could fill a book I think we talked about that earlier just a lot more hounding people it all comes back to this session and WP what level would you not employ these strategies as much 2015 hundreds still a lot of this stuff works or like anything beyond mm I don't know how many they are there are you playing the WP this summer at least the main I never missed made I don't know much else of God uh-oh will I play events at other yeah more about the money don't really care about winning a bracelet I don't know if you're supposed to see it be neat but see what would your strategy be with ace ace or King King under the guy when you preflop three betting of $30.00 behind you you can usually stagger your bat sizes to get three streets from a lesser pair is a lesser pair that bigger of a pot will not raise you and if they raise you usually they're telling you they got it it's hard to find guys l raising multi way boards as a bluff Multi reponses and bluff are called with the intention to raise on the turn as a block well guys I think I gotta wrap this up Jeff said he just watch my bow thank you sir oh god there's a lot of you guys today I'm so sorry I can't finish it off there is like there's another yeah anyways guys I do have to run my my girlfriend has dinner on the table I don't want to be disrespectful I really appreciate you showing up today I really appreciate your time I really appreciate you guys listening to what I have to say I really appreciate that thank you very much for tuning in I hope you had a good time yeah this is Alexander for thrilled or

[Document(page_content="hello everyone I am Jonathan little and recently my students have been crushing it at the poker table at the World Series of Poker Joe foresman want a bracelet Ryan de pollo recently final tabled the Colossus at the World Series of Poker and the $25,000 by an Seminole Hard Rock Poker Open final table I was a stroll into the Hall going to play a tournament and someone who I did not know walked up to me and said that a month ago he joined poker coaching calm he was a good cash game player but had no success in tournaments and he studied up hard for a month he devoted his life to studying at poker coaching comm and then right off the bat he final tables of 25k they're crushing it I guess to be fair I don't feel like I'm crushing it but I'm crushing it - I'm on a tournament at Hard Rock so what I decided to do is every month I am going to hand pick one or two people to back in poker tournaments we started this one month ago and the first person we backed Mike we put him into a $600 Seminole Hard Rock Poker Open tournament and heated up caching for 1370 dollars what we're doing is Michael send us back half of that and he keeps half of it so it's a very nice free roll for him so each month I am going to be hand picking one or two of you to play in live poker tournament to be considered there's a link below this video where poker coaching members can apply I'll go through them I'll take a look and I'll pick a person so one of the perks of this is that if I pick you you can send in hand histories from the tournament that you play for me to review and Mike was kind enough to send in a few spots that gave him a little bit of trouble so let's take a look at those hands and see if Mike can improve his play in any way here we have King 10 of Hearts in early position which is fine enough I'm raising King Center hearts and almost every scenario playing tutor big blinds deep it's perfectly fine to open it up and Mike gets a call from a tight aggressive player in third position and then a tight passive player in the low Jack seat pop comes ten nine four two diamonds so this is a situation where you want to generally be doing a decent amount of checking because 10 9 X should connect pretty well with the opponent's ranges and not so well with Mike's range so I think checking is fine that said we do have one of our better hands and is also quite vulnerable to being out drawn so I also don't mind betting so if we are going to bet given we're not betting here all that frequently we want to bet using a rather large size that's just because we're betting here with our best made hands and our draws so we are gonna want to bet something like 800 in this scenario maybe even 1,200 I think it's perfectly fine to pot it early in a tournament you're usually going to find that people are not going to view pot sized bets as a big bet there's gonna think oh it's 1200 out of my 20,000 no big deal so I like a bet of about a thousand in the scenario Mike goes 500 and I definitely think this is way too small if we weren't to be betting with a lot of our range or all of our range perhaps the size could be fine but the problem is is that like say we have aces here do I really want to bet 500 and let our opponents call with all sorts of gun shots and open into straight draws and flush draws and backdoor flush draws it's like not really right I'd much rather than call more with those hands because then they're just putting money in poorly or fold so the same logic kind of goes with this hand I don't necessarily want to play a pot where our prone that's gonna be sticking around all sorts of marginal stuff so yeah my Mike best 500 only one player calls turns three of clubs same stories on the flop right we still have the best hand a lot of the time I think you're usually gonna find that when you bet small on the flop like 500 to 1200 people typically raise when they think they have the best hand so if that's the case when we get to the turn we probably still have the best handle on right the three is pretty much irrelevant besides backdoor flush draws improve their equity so for that reason I think we want to keep betting and we want to keep betting big like 2000 because if it meant 2000 now we're giving the draws a pretty bad price to continue and we also just get called by some worse made hands because whatever there are lots of girls available you're gonna find some people become calling stations with hands like Queen nine Jack nine ace nine Jack ten stuff like that and you know as they should right if I'm sitting on my phone eschews and I have Jack tenure I'm just not folding for any bet and what essentially happens is as your betting using a bigger size you are polarizing arrange to the best mate hands and drawers this is at the bottom of the best mate hand range but it's still good enough to valley but I think in the spot obviously we lose to a few hands my leg pocket jacks ace ten ten nine right but whenever you've got small the flop and just get call the thing that discounts those to some extent so I like a two thousand bet my goes a thousand again so this seems to be a perhaps a consistent mistake where is using bet sizes that are a little bit too small we'll see if that plays out in the rest of the hands and I have to review but I definitely have bet 2,000 here on the turn River is jack of spades so now you always want to ask how does his hand line up with my range and my opponents range and actually want ends up with our range okay if we had jack ten would probably be betting maybe not except to say but we'd definitely be betting with King Jack Queen Jack and King Queen so we have something of hands in this scenario so the question becomes doing one I have a checking range and if we do have a checking range or we check calling it an adequate frequency and also if we have a betting range like how wide is it and I don't think we need to be betting this and if we bet this in we're just always getting called by all the hands with a jack right so for that reason I think we just want to check and see what develops so we do check an opponent now blasted what do we think of this well this is pretty bad for us right this is the scenario we kind of want to put our opponent in on the earlier streets where we can be betting big to put them in a bad spot now that we bet or we face a four thousand betta pot size better opponents ranges pretty clearly good made hands probably compared better maybe ace Jack type hands are better although a strikes kind of unlikely maybe King Jack side hands and better and then busted drawers you want to ask what busted drawers are there and the problem with this jacket spades all the river lines up really well with draws the would have otherwise busted like 87 got there right King Queen got there maybe a screen of diamonds would Bluff a sex and diamonds would Bluff so our possible Bluff combinations and you know we do block King Queen with the king and our hand so maybe this is a spot where for our opponent is a little bit aggressive I don't really mind a call that said it is a pretty bad spot to be in and you have to ask in this scenario and live poker especially would my opponent use this size mostly for value or mostly as a bluff and you will find actually the some players use big sizes or pot size bets almost entirely for either value or Bluff but not both and if you can figure out that about your opponent then clearly life is great that's that in this scenario this is clear that really bad card for our hand so we should probably fold purely because of that but I definitely do not hate calling in these scenarios especially early in tournaments because first unless your opponents know that you don't like the fold also say your opponent does show up with a bluff say that you show up with a rough bluff like six five of clubs right to show up at six type of clubs that's good that's telling now our phone knows you're gonna hero call them a little bit and also you know that they like to splash around a little bit all that's good information the problem with folding is we don't get any of that information and especially early on in tournaments I'm not gonna say I'm gonna make like horribly bad calls like I'd never call you with ace five right but I would consider calling in the scenario with a king 10 Saipan so I probably would have called unless I have some sort of read that the opponent was definitely strong so anyway Mike bold to move on with their lives basically three hundred under the gun raised who's active you go ahead and free bet Mike makes a thousand which i think is great a tight passive player cold calls so what type of range the type passive players usually have that's going to be a lot of hands like big cars big stupid cards ace king ace Queen suited ace Jack suited King Queen suited Queen Jack suited Jack ten suited pocket pairs right for all we know all the way down to twos if the opponent loves to splash around with any pair some people do have some people know but this one these spots where I think people really find selves lost post-flop because they really want to specifically narrow their opponents range like okay this guy called my thousand rate so he has jacks or Tim's and that's it like well sorry that's not how poker works the guys range is defined in some way in like his mind but certainly we have no way of actually figuring that out when our end so we need to essentially wait it to some extent understanding that we don't exactly know how it's going to be waged so like who knows how much of his ranges well ace-queen compared to a nine suited right obviously it's gonna Maurice Queen the next nine suited but it's tough to say depending on the opponent right and we don't know because we're at early in the tournament so the Epona strange is kind of clouded and that's okay find it a gun it's gonna have something reasonable because he graze under the gun didn't call it a three back alright vlog comes ace queen six with a heart under the gun checks and our hero bets nineteen hundred I think this is fine anytime the board contains two big cards you may consider betting bigger with your hands it tend to be the best hand but this is okay we can also perhaps just go even a little bit a little bit bigger obviously the player in the low Jack so you could just have a screen or by the Queen's or a pocket sixes I don't think that's impossible but at the same time it's also unlikely because we have an ace Marian right like we block ace Queen which is the most the most likely candidate so anyway we blog go 1900 yeah get men ranged getting men race here is awful because the opponent is essentially saying if they actually are tight and passive that they have ace Queen or maybe Queens or sixes and it's always annoying when this happens because you don't really know maybe they're just over playing ace Jack or ace king or ace 10 or ace seven for all we know right and this is where poker is stuff because like right here if we call and get a good card like a king or a heart and our opponent keeps blasting it probably know if they're the type of player who just may rip it in you know we're gonna call pops gonna go up to what 10,000 11,000 they give us rip it in for fifteen or sixteen and I would not be shocked if that happens if that's what they're gonna do and we do act improve on this urn like say we get a king we can't fall but we could just ill just be dead right again well not dead but nearly dead against Queens or sixes if they have a draw well that's another thing worth mentioning they could have a draw all right most people typically don't men raised with draws but again who knows right so many people want to get in their hand that they know what their opponents are doing because they think I would never been raised with a draw here so my opponents never been raising with a draw or this player hasn't played very many hands in the first 30 minutes of the tournament therefore they're tight and passive over 30 minutes he just doesn't matter I was talking to someone today and they were giving me very specific reads on the opponent like oh they would never play the turn this way that's so how long have you played with them that go a lot for about two and two and a half hours like to say you don't know you know how this guy's gonna play the turn in a very specific spot with exactly as marginal made and requires a lot of data we don't have any data we have two and a half hours which is like nothing so anyway right here what do we do I don't know there's so much we trust this tight pass and read if we trust this type passive read to be a hundred percent accurate to narrow this guy's range to specifically a six food and better which a bowl but we don't trust that very often and it's important to not trust that all right we call turns the 10 of hearts all right we check I was gonna say please don't go all in haha and it goes all in so look what do I do in this scenario I just call it off I don't love it but we have loads of Alice no matter what the opponent has right Ziggler has a set we still have the hard outs and the jack outs if the opponent has ace Queen we have the King outs the jack outs and the Hart House right so obviously we're behind we're putting our money in poorly but does the opponent ever have a draw do they ever have King ten of spades Jack ten of spades Jack nine of spades ten nine of spades nine 8 of spades eight seven of spades if they ever have those hands and we fold folding is awful now again this is up to you to figure out how often they actually have those hands and it's tough to know but again these are the types of calls I typically make as long as they don't have any sort of about my opponent and if you Busta's okay because like worst case we have loads of equity in best case our opponents drawing pretty thin probably know the guy is just blasting of an ace Jack that's another consideration they could just be over playing right if they're blasting with ace Jack then clearly Bouldin would be awful so it's one in scenarios where calling is usually a little bit bad or calling is amazingly good and when that's the case I typically lean towards calling but I guess we can just look in the opponent and they've essentially turn their hand face up as a set guess foldings fine right so one of the spots where a lot of people if they do call and their opponent shows up with a setter AIDS queen be like oh I knew I should have folded but then when they show up with 87 spades you're like oh yeah obviously easy call that's not really a poker works because you don't know what the opponent has and you don't know how they're gonna play anyway Mike Bouldin there I think that was probably a little bit that's fine look it's fine to fold if you're really really confident you read I though I'm not all that confident and hypothetical labels placed on an online poker player all right here we have limp we can let the 6-4 flop comes eight seven seven and this is spot where if you're gonna bet you definitely wanna bet bigger so Mike across the board you wanna be betting bigger when you're when you're playing not you know 10 15 20 big blinds deep especially when your range is relatively polarized and in all these spots to some extent you're saying you have a pretty good made hand or a pretty good draw and right here I would definitely bet bigger because we want to get money in the pot with our trips yes we could be beat but we are just not so concerned with that because we have a really really good end so if you're gonna bet I'd be betting mm I'd be like betting in elem pot if there was a raise preflop like say someone raised calling you call big blind I definitely checked the flop looking to check raise because then one of the two players especially the preflop raiser is going to be inclined to bet but in a limp pot you're gonna be less inclined to face the bet because people are just gonna check it through so I like the flop bet but I would have bet 2,000 get called by the big blind which is not really the player you want to get called by you might trying to get called by the high Jack because big blind has all the sevens and obviously you lose to all the sevens that's that big white also has a lot of draws so on the turn oh just keep betting purely for value the thing is is whenever you have a seven in your hand if to realize it's very very unlikely for you to be against the seven because you bought essentially so you're way more likely being it's a draw or an eight so now that we're very likely meeting us to draw or an eight I think we can go something like three thousand on the turn three thousand doesn't give the draws great odds and it's probably not gonna fold let me just continue building the pop of their trips so twenty five hundred again Mike slightly bigger best sizes especially on coordinated boards where is a fourth all right well we have pretty much the nuts some people may look at this and say oh but we could be against eight seven in Queen seven and pocket queens and pocket eights like yeah you could but you're probably not and if you are you lose your money again don't get in the habit of making big folds unless your opponents are literally the weakest tightest knits who never ever ever ever Bluff and that's not what the label says so I'm not gonna pretend like that's the case or you know even people over value right some people look at age seven and think it's the nuts all right so we want to bet we're trying to get call by an eight I think we need to go small here we can't go too big because if we go too big what's gonna happen is our proponents see usually only gonna call us with a seven and we have no indication at all the opponent is a seven because a lot of people just raise sevens on the flop or the term so we really are trying to get call by a queen or an eight and most likely an eight right because if I would have had to call a flop with a queen so I think a small bet here is pretty nice because if we best small we will get call by eight which is good also we will perhaps induce the draws to raise whereas if we check yeah the draws may bet maybe think well maybe they won't but we're not gonna get value from an eight ever because nature is gonna check behind right if you can someone tell the opponent's range is like all busted drawers I suppose checking is better especially given Epona hasn't raised at any point with the drawers which a lot of people would do so I think we just need to go for a small bed of like 3500 we go fifteen thousand though Wow I think fifteen thousand is only good best size if you just like know the opponent as a seven but I'm not sure what world we would think the opponent has a seven so definitely small here I mean I like the idea of alright we beat everything this is one of our best hands let's use a big size but you always also want to consider especially a live poker against most opponents who will call small bet sizes with junky marginal hands and call all big bed sizes only with the nuts not thinking all the drawers in this therefore I need to call a lot they'll just like fold everything besides a set in here this is about where I think that I would have used a small best size and well mike actually gets call somehow by nine seven I mean obviously ninety seven to the call but it's a situation where it's pretty unlikely you're against the seven I think again in live poker sometimes you can just tell maybe Mike could tell but given the way the opponent did not raise the flop did not raise the turn especially facing a small bet on coordinated board you should really not think you're against too many settings here but hey we weren't good job so it's nice when you're against exactly the and you want to be against all right eight six suited this is flashy I would fold this under almost all scenarios with forty big blind stack unless I have been very tight and passive and everybody else has been very tight and passive so we raise we get men raised by a tight passive player that's not good now I have to put in two thousand and try to win at ten thousand eight hundred ten thousand five hundred pot so we need to have 20% equity from out of position with a suti connected type and let's do it let's try to get there we got there boom seven six five or six five four two diamonds we check opponent best so now you want to ask yourself in this scenario how do we get over pairs to fold that's the goal because we beat ace king we beat most everything besides over pairs right so given we beat everything besides over pairs we don't really care about ace king because the a seems probably not gonna be putting much more money in the pot but aces and kings and queens can actually do a whole lot to mess us up by betting very big on the turn notice if we call pots gonna go to eighteen thousand if I'm still have 28 behind for all we know again they just may rip it in this is probably the same opponent as before and we have the ace king so if that's the case then I think we probably just wanted Jam immediately and you may say well the owners never folding an over pair if you jammed you'd be surprised especially if they view this tournament as relevant as a significant event that they really don't want to bust from a lot of players will just make big holes especially if you just yep gotcha and pile your money in right if you make it clear to your opponents that you love your hand you're putting your money in and there's nothing they can do about it a lot of people will knit up you'll be surprised how tight people will play in that scenario so anyway I like a shove because again you're gonna get over pairs to fold sometimes if they do call you that's fine you have loads of equity and that's it you may say shouldn't we call is to try to induce Bluffs that would be a much better concern if we were late position against late position or if we knew our opponent was loose and aggressive we here we have our opponent labeled as tight and passive right so against a tight and passive player this is a type of player who's not going to be bluffing all facecam not gonna be three betting too often preflop who Bluffs and certainly is going to keep firing at this turning river with air also another bit of a concern is if they do have a hand like aces and the turn is a diamond they may not pay us so if they'll pay us when we get in there that's also a bit of a bummer so I think I would just rip it in you're gonna fold equity and when you don't whatever you still you still get there every once in a while we call turns of five we checked put about 6k this is a little bit nasty now because the opponent's starting to put in a substantial amount of their chips and I would start to discount ace all right cases are discount Ace King a pretty good amount so if we're discounting Ace King then these were to be against a whole lot of aces kings queens Taipans right if that's the case we should probably not raise now but again I don't hate it right we have all the five some parried our opponent not a ton of them I understand but we have some Andy Turner has none and also we do have the sets we do have some straights and we have loads of draws it would love to shove so I think I'm still just shoving in rivers three diamonds and now we have to ask is this opponent ever betting the river well probably not right so we can go ahead and forget about that so if that's the question we have to ask should we bet should we lead the problem here with leading from a game theory optimal point of view it's like yes we have straights and flushes in our range but our opponent has flushes they actually do have nut flushes in the range with ace king ace Queen maybe ice dragon diamonds so I think we have to be a little bit careful leading here because when we lead we're probably gonna get called by over pairs with a diamond cases with diamond Kings with diamond queens with diamond that's my dear right not a whole lot of hands and when we get raised well I think we reluctantly have to fold so again one people are never raised us on the river if we bet cuz a bluff probably not but some people will not very often though probably not a tight passive player in a 600 dollar tournament so anyway I don't hate leading but I think checking is probably just okay especially if the opponent does have a hand like ace king and we'll take a see demons king or Ace King of Diamonds and continue bluffing it at this point we are playing five hundred thousands we've been playing for quite a while in earnest maybe we have a bit of a read on the opponent's how often they are actually willing to run turning river bluffs and if it is frequently then definitely check if it's never then leading becomes viable we're trying to get called by over pairs right so I bet small given this board justices we haven't nope we have no Bluff see right so ever you have no Bluffs and the opponent's range really shrunk up to mostly marginal stuff I like a small bit of about 8,000 and Mike goes all-in and I don't like this player this is kind of similar to the previous one where yes you have a good hand one of the best things we can have but what are we trying to get called by we're trying to get called by a marginal hand and right here on given aces is marginal right so I think the only we could call my hand like aces is to bet something like 8,000 whereas if we blast it all in there they're just gonna fold I'm sure now I'm gonna say that aces are gonna call us Punk called well there you go Kings huh wrong again Jonathan wrong again opponent call literal nothing um clearly you don't expect the opponent to call it literal nothing and to be fair this actually shows you a big difference in where the way players think about hands right Kings is an awful hand here especially King of Spades king of clubs because they don't block any of the flushes also what do they beat eight maybe pot they think pocket eights is gonna check call check call lead the river all as a bluff that doesn't make any sense backdoor heart draw maybe like Queen Jack of Hearts that check called the flop and decided to check call to turn somehow and then decides to lead all in on the river I don't know man but hey as long as it works good for you I am shocked who the opponents are calling you with nothing it's always nice when they do that though all right we're down to 35,000 has 35,000 affective chips 1,500 3,000 and we have King Jack parts in the small blind this is a pretty easy shove normally you say opponent frequently raises small blind lips so I think I actually like limping then if you tell me you're gonna limp a lot if you limp your opponent's gonna raise you a ton and then raisin becomes pretty nice right cuz you limp they raise to 10,000 you Jam all-in they fold good and if you say if you limp they're gonna Jam all in every time that's not so bad either because King Jack of Hearts does pretty well against a wide range we could also just open Jam I think open Jam is definitely a fine default play limiting is also fine knowing you're not folding into a race by the way if you do limp this hand against most people almost everybody and they Jam you you have an easy call so either Jam or limp I think I would probably limp given this read right here but Jamie's fine tune see you general any calls was the easy holidays for no I did anything wrong in that hand King Queenie spoiler we're about to get tough here we open it up we're playing 10,000 big wine and we get bunch of callers so they check and small one checks we have to figure out what we want to do with this and this is actually a little bit of a dice your spot than it may appear because snacks are pretty shallow right if we bet pretty much anything at this point I don't see how we can get away from this just coz thing we do bet 60 K which Mike does if anyone raises or jams there are so many draw they can potentially have that we just have to pay them off so is that fine are we fine getting our money in this scenario I think we just are I mean you're never just trying to blast your money in four ways with top pair second kicker but ace Queens pretty unlikely for the opponent's Queen ten we block tens is unlikely because a lot of images rear is preflop so there really aren't a whole lot of combinations of logical hands that we lose them and there are a lot of draws that we beat like King Jack Jack nine Spade draws so I like the bad with the idea that we're just not gonna fold so we bet luckily the short sack jams because then we just have a very very easy call and we get any gets a set so one of the few combinations that we actually do lose to and you know that's gonna happen understand that sometimes in poker tournaments you are just gonna run into it and there's not a whole lot that you can do about that notice funny given the run out and probably lose to everything unless your opponent ran delay on like eight seven of Spades but sometimes that's just how it goes so after this hand Mike blind it out a bit gutter all-in with pocket fours he jams were early position with pocket fours someone re-raise ace 10 off suit and the ace 10 off suit one which is like okay so that is how Mike the first person we backed from poker coaching calm cash in the

[Document(page_content="hello and welcome to tonight's webinar my first webinar for poker coaching com entitled a deeper dive into position this is a really really exciting presentation and I really want to thank you for coming out and joining me tonight I'm really excited about doing this teaching is one of my favorite things in the world and playing poker is probably my other favorite thing in the world so when you put the two together teaching people how to play better pokers pretty much the best thing in the world for me today we're gonna be talking about positions which is one of the fundamentals one of the foundations for profitable poker and yeah let's get into the action and let's get stacking so first why talk about position well for those of you who know me through Jonathan littles material you know that I was one of the co-authors for excelling at No Limit Hold'em and I wrote chapter one in that book my chapter was entitled the six ingredients for a winning poker game and that included a heavy emphasis on what I first popularized back in 2008 when I first started teaching on YouTube the triple threat now the triple threat consists of three components the first one is position which we are going to be diving deep into tonight the second one is aggression which we will be diving deep into April 30th and the third component is selection which we will be diving deep into May 28th so if you're interested in learning everything you can about the triple threat and three of the key ingredients for a winning poker game save-the-dates write those down for your calendar now my approach to poker is about getting every advantage you can and the triple threat accounts for three of those five advantages the so for the information advantage that is a core that is achieved through the use of position this skill and betting advantage is achieved through the use of aggression and the card and hand range advantage is achieved through the use of selection psychological advantage is a whole thing on the metagame and the stamina game or physical or mental advantage depending on what you want to call it is its own thing - tonight we're gonna focus on position how we can get the information advantage and this is going to be one of the core principles that we're gonna combine with the other pillars to just make an extremely powerful poker game yeah so let's get into it poker coaching calm I'm joining the team I'm joining team poker coaching it's been a long time in the making and I'm really excited about this honestly when Jonathan reached out about excelling at No Limit hold him in the first place I was kind of flattered and I was I was pretty just like honored for the opportunity and I just I just jumped on it and then a couple years later you know I saw he was building up poker coaching calm the site looked really good my friends were telling me great things about it and when he reached out to me about this I was like wow the universe has just gifted me something I've really always wanted which was to be part of a training team to not really just be teaching on my own but to be part of a bigger team Jonathan is an absolute genius a great poker mind and a great business mind and I just I just love working with him he's such a pleasure to work with very professional he's very available he helps in technical difficulties like this and it's it's a real honor and anyone who's been following grips between 2014 and now knows how much I love Alex Fitzgerald's one of my main tournament mentors who's helped me get a lot of results and Matt Affleck is an awesome dude - we've played in the World Series together and I can honestly say that his chapter and Alex's in excelling at No Limit Hold'em were the ones that I learned the most from so as a coach at poker coaching comm wow it feels pretty cool saying that I will be doing webinars like this one and I will also be doing hand quizzes as well with an emphasis on cash games I spent the first seven of my career playing cash games both online and live it is my bread and butter and despite the fact that I've put a ton of effort into tournaments studying them playing them and getting results in them cash is still my bread and butter so that's what I'm gonna be primarily bringing to poker coaching com is overarching theory that applies to all forms of poker and a lot of cash game hand reviews so like I said before it's really an honor to be working alongside these guys and something I'm really grateful for so big thank you to Jonathan if you're listening for inviting me on board so position let's let's really get into the material now because that's what you all came here for in my opinion position is to poker what location is to real-estate and if you're watching and you know a thing about real estate or you've heard anything about real estate they swen the question is what are the three three keys to success in real estate they are location location location so in poker if you want to have success you want that major key to success think position position position if you want to take a sports metaphor for example instead of a real estate example playing in position is like having an extra man on the court it's like playing five on four in basketball or five on four and hockey or you know 12 on 11 in football or 11 on 10 depending on where which country are playing football in or you know if you're playing international soccer 12 on 11 playing out of position on the other hand is like being on the penalty kill or having one of your players got in a red card or in the case of baseball you know having two outfielders there instead of three it's not a guaranteed recipe for failure but it makes for a much harder time to win the game and to protect yourself if strategy games are more your thing and you prefer you know a war example playing in position is like having the higher terrain in a battle as playing out of position is like fighting an uphill battle where you may win while fighting an uphill battle but you're gonna need to have great weapons which is you know your cards and you're gonna need great strategic execution which is you're betting to overcome your disadvantage of having you know the the lower terrain or you know in the case of poker the worst position so you know when you have that better terrain you can just see so much more or you know in the sports example having the extra player is like an extra set of eyes in the game which is what position is all about it's something that gives you access to more information you can see more of what's going on you have more information and in a game of imperfect information knowledge is power and it's it's it's free information a third thing about position that you definitely want to know is that position gives you extra control over the pot size we will dive deeper into this as we get into the following slides this is our introduction just so you can know what kind of terrain we're going to be covering tonight the fourth thing you need to know about position is that the power of position is amplified by stack depth the deeper the stacks are the more beneficial the more powerful the greater the advantages of having position are the lower the staff decks stop stack depths the less important position becomes number five is that positional awareness is essential to win at poker it's one of the first things that I encourage my students to look for at the table when paying attention to opponents opening ranges is are they positionally aware do they open different hands from under the gun than they do from on the button or do they play the same hands from all positions and if they aren't positionally aware it's probably a less skilled player and someone worth going after whereas when someone does adjust their ranges from position to position to position and place fewer hands early position in more hands late position that person is positionally aware which means they are more aware of one of the key components of poker strategy probably aware of more and therefore a dangerous player and the sixth thing that you need to know about position is when done correctly when paying attention to the right things you can play in position more often than others and you can have a huge advantage over the competition in every pot that you enter I remember watching the World Poker Tour back in the day with Mike Sexton and Vince Van Patten and I remember my saying that the goal in poker is to make correct decisions and when we're in position were more able to make more correct decisions because we have more information the more information we have the more able we are to make correct decisions so this is a picture from him at the final table of WPT Montreal where he won his first World Poker Tour probably largely thanks to the power of position so how does position help us make correct decisions before we go through the bullet points let me ask you a question if you were a detective solving a mystery and you had a choice between getting one clue to help you solve the mystery or two Clues what would you pick let me know in the chat just type in number one or number two - two - two - lol 2 - ha ha - 2 - obviously to to to to to to to to to to okay so we're in an agreement that we would rather have two pieces of information than one piece of information when trying to solve a mystery now okay what if instead of the option of one or two you had the choice between three clues or four clues which would you pick let me know in the chat number three or number four for clues for sure how about four or four four four four Connect for everybody for thumbs up for let's go four okay so clearly more clues is better than less clues when we're trying to solve a mystery and another way to look at poker is that your detective trying to put the mystery together to solve the puzzle and figure out what's really going on so this is what position gives you this is what position gives you is that when you are in a position your opponent's act first thereby giving you information and you get to act second you get to act later thereby getting more information it's it's you know it's it's very simple it's very basic but it's so easy to forget about just how important this is and the deeper we get into this I'm gonna show you how it grows so the first key concept is we want to have position because we want to go last so we can have more information to be able to make better decisions in this game of imperfect information we also get to the right to act last on every street this is when we have absolute position because we can have other players ahead of us getting to act last means you get info on every opponent in the hand so the guy who has the worst position will give information to the players who have better and best position but you as the player who has the best absolute position will get information on player 1 on player 2 on every player who has to act before you but they don't get that information on you so we're starting to create an unfair information advantage we're starting to create an imbalance set up where we are the favorite and the better our position the better the info this is something that's my good friend and mentor Calvin Anderson taught me is that the biggest flaw that most players have especially when they try to loosen up their game and play more hands and play more aggressively and put more pressure on their opponents is that they play too loose early position and too tight in late position what I mean by this is when they want to loosen up what most players do is they just start to play more hands from all positions now they still do it in a scale in a range they don't play 50 percent of hands from every position but they kind of widen up equally in all the positions and this is a mistake we're gonna look even more into this with some charts later in the presentation to illustrate the point more but the problem is when we equally expand our range from all positions it ignores the laws of position we want to open our range slightly more from early position but open it up a crazy amount in late position because we have that huge advantage of greater information on every street as the hand progresses and in terms of making correct decisions it's also important to know that there are two types of position there is relative and absolute position which we're gonna dive into on the next slide so just because you don't have the button which is where absolute position lives doesn't mean that you can't get an information edge on your opponent you can get an information edge on some of your opponent's you just won't have as big of an edge as the person I mentioned who acts last on every Street and who has absolute position so this is a little table chart showing the positions to just make this understandable and we have the early position middle position and late position which is really useful for preflop and then post flop doesn't really matter more on that as we progress so the first position the first type of position which is the most valuable type of position is absolute position this is owned by the player on the button or by the player who is the last raiser so if the buttons planning on folding then absolute position would belong to the cut off if the cut off and button are both planning unfolding then absolute position or would belong to middle position if every single player is planning on folding then whoever opens the pot first and that's actually pretty important you might want to write that down whoever opens first if everyone else is planning on folding is going to have absolute position in the hand so if you actually know that the whole table is gonna fall behind you and we'll talk more later on how you can achieve this you can open in early position and still have absolute position the important thing is who is left to act behind you and how are they likely to react to your open something also I popularized way back one is coining the term of the Money chip I would really like you to think about the dealer chip as the money chip the reason being because when you have that in front of you is when you are going to be making the most money you always have absolute position when you have the button provided that you play your hand and next we have relative position which is achieved by closing the action so preflop if there is a raise from under the gun 1 and middle position calls the big blind has dibs on relative position they have the opportunity to close the action something I realized while making this presentation though is we can we can pay for the right to gain relative position by limping in because if under the gun limps in and someone else raises late positions react the big blind has to react before under the gun acts also we can straddle to pick up relative position but it's something that we have to pay for and it's not as valuable as absolute position so in the absence of others having relative position is good but having absolute position is better and having both is best now as a reminder of how to get it to get absolute position play the button and to get relative position be the player closing the action the ways to not get relative position would be to be the first caller of an open because anyone else who over calls behind you is going to have relative position on you after the flop and how to not get absolute position is by playing hands from early position especially if the players behind you are loose active players like to call raises 3bet do things like that another way of understanding relative position is it's your position relative to the preflop aggressor so if you have a preflop aggressor who you expect to continuation bet on many boards by having relative position you get to see what everyone else does after that action before you make your action so yeah the the only way to lose absolute position is when you're on the button is to fold preflop which is why there are many strategies that you can implement to get position more few examples are limping on the button when you have aggressive three betters in the blinds so that you can call a raise and play the rest of the hand in position with a deep pot to stack ratio another example is raising to a smaller amount on the button with aggressive 3 betters so when they three bet you will be getting better odds on your call but also you'll be dealing a smaller pot preflop therefore higher stock pot ratio which gives a bigger amplification to the benefit of position which we will show on a later slide and the last one is when facing an open you know let's say middle position or the cut off opens and you're on the button to 3bet rather than flooding when there are habitual squeezers and the blinds reason being let's say for example you know the big blind has a three bet percentage of fifteen and a cold four bet percentage of like I don't know three percent or you know will go will go loose will go five percent if you flat you're gonna get three bet fifteen percent of the time maybe you can't continue whereas if you three bet you're only going to get cold for about five percent of the time that means looking at fifteen versus five percent you're able to continue you're able to have absolute position sixty-seven percent more often if you three bet rather than flat with habitual squeezers in a position where you don't have a hand that can call a three bet and that's why a lot of hands our best plate is three bets rather than flat calls especially when you have position and the opportunity to have absolute positions throughout the hand you want to protect that and the easiest way to do that is to knock out the players behind you who may want to try to take position from you so the key thing to take away from this slide if you're taking notes you want to write something down is that you want to play the widest range of hands on the button because that is the position from where you have the highest expected profit if you look through your database if you look through your hands you will almost certainly see that you make the most money when you are on the button followed by the cutoff followed by the other positions in the least amount on the blinds and it just goes to show that position is king in this game all right I really like the way that Dan y'know grand you put this and he's definitely someone who knows a thing or two about position here's him playing at by the looks of the chips probably the one drop by the looks of the table being a sports fan by the way guys questions please write them down and then like save them in a notepad so we can post them all at the end of the presentation I've got about 15 more minutes of slides and then I'm gonna field questions from everybody so just keep them handy save them and I'll be ready to respond to all of them at the end of the slideshow because I see there are a couple great ones in the chat and I want to feel those so being a sports fan day on the ground you looks at things in terms of being in control so the way he looks at it is when you're in position you're on offense you're the aggressor you're putting pressure on your opponent's you're acting on them and when you're out of position you're on defense you are trying to kind of hold your ground and you are reacting to the opponent's who are probably putting pressure on you because position allows you all the things that we mentioned in the previous slides okay so talking about control let's talk about how position helps us play with more control so a couple slides ago we talked about early position middle position late position and out of position but honestly that's really just for preflop which is part of the game but it's not the main part of the game most of the money is exchanged after the flop most of the money is wagered after the flop whether you're in position or out of position and so once we get back past preflop and you know that was just kind of a way to plan your preflop strategy you need to know that it's no early middle and late position you're either in position or you're not so yes you can have better position than others in multi way pots but truly having absolute position truly being in position is everything because better position you know well it means you get more information than the worst position you don't get control and what we really want when we're playing poker is control all over the action control over our opponents and here's an example here are two plays which can only be applied by the player in absolute position the players with relative position the players with you know second best position cannot apply these plays and you're gonna see that these are two really powerful plays that give us control over the action the first one is the free card play which is an old play that originated in Limit Hold'em because bet size increased on the turn so an Limit Hold'em you know let's let's say you're playing $0.50 a dollar for simplicity the bets preflop are 1 1 1 1 1 the bets on the flop are 1 1 1 1 1 you know 1 2 3 4 the bets on the term would be 2 4 6 8 and the best one would be 2 4 6 8 and the idea behind the free card play was if you had a draw in position and your opponent bet the flop for 1 and you expected that if you called his bet he was gonna follow through him bet the turn for 2 well instead of calling the flop bet and calling the turn bet to try to see if we could realize our equity by the river what you would do to execute the free card plays you would raise the flop to 2 to represent a stronger hand than you have hope that your opponent would just call fearing that you may have a stronger hand than theirs and when they checked you on the turn instead of continuing to bet which is what you would do with your stronger hands you check back and see the turn in river for a second bet and you only put in one extra chip with that flop raise instead of having to put in two extra chips for the turn bet and this is something that is carried over to No Limit Hold'em as well because generally speaking the size of a flop race is going to be smaller than the size of a turn bet and it also gives us a lot of control because you know we have the implied threat of are we going to bet the turn and the river and we have a lot more flexibility and power because we have position the second play is the free showdown play which is in my in my understanding purely a No Limit play that originated and no and the idea is very similar to the free card play but instead of executing on the flop it's executed on the turn and the way this play works is when your opponent bets the turn for whatever amount is we'll just say you know he bets 50 dollars into a pot where the size isn't relevant and you assume that he's gonna bet the river for you know 75 or 100 or 150 what you would do instead of calling the turn bets to you know evaluate on the river you would raise the turn bet you know if you're planning to call the river you would raise the turn bet to say a hundred or a hundred and twenty and then when he checks to you on the river you have the option to just check and showdown your hand for the price of your raise on the turn which you set the price rather than the price of their river bet so again you by doing the free showdown play which you can only do in position you are taking control you are choosing the price for which you are going to showdown your hand on the turn rather than letting them choose the price of the showdown by calling their bat and calling again plus with the free showdown play you also have the opportunity to bet the river after raising the turn you know like it's a very strong line to call flop raise turn in bet river and that's why this is a great play to make with the nuts but also with draws so that you can add fold equity to your draws and not only win the pot when you make your hand but also have a chance to win the pot by making your opponent fold and a really great play to make with blockers because even though they may not your opponent might fear the turn bet that much they may fear that a bigger bed is coming on the river and say well I don't want to put this money in on the turn if I can't call the river and I sue my opponent's gonna bet the river so they may fold to the term bet because of the threat of a river bet and that's how you can get a lot more fold equity with little risk and it comes in position there is no play out of position that achieves the same thing that these two plays do and this is just another example of just how powerful position is another thing about being in position as I mentioned is when you're in position you have the right to last action and thus the ability to build the pot greatly compared to your opponent's who are out of position so in cash game poker the play is typically a hundred big blinds which means we play flops turns and rivers unlike tournaments where a lot of time it's preflop and flop so this is kind of what pot growth looks like this is an image from my book the cash game guide so because of the extra info we get to apply it on bigger more meaningful streets so you don't just get to apply your positional advantage on the flop which you can see is much more significant than preflop you also get to apply it on the turn which is much more significant than both flop and preflop in fact it's more significant than both of them put together and you get to apply it on the river which is even bigger so you know this is how a poker hand goes you know we start the hand with little information and we make little bets and then the pot grows where we have more information and the bets get bigger and then as we get to the later in later streets the pots get to their biggest and the imposition player who gets right to last action right to grow the pot one more time over their opponents gets the most info and gets the opportunity to make the biggest bets so like just think about how big an advantage that is not only do you get more information than your opponents but you also get the choice the strategic option to apply that information when the stakes are at their highest its massive now when I first saw this image it didn't quite do it justice so what I did was I made one in paint forgive mine on elite skills I'm just a poker teacher I'm not a graphic designer and I put the image together to show just how significant the later Street play is relative to the earlier street play and the deeper the stacks the more we're playing in the redzone you know the yellow zone the red zone and even beyond the red zone as the stacks get very deep and again the player with position has an advantage in all these circles so the deeper the stacks the more streets we play the more betting we do the bigger the bets the bigger the advantage for the player in position and this is why relative position is overrated how many blue circles are there in the red one how many green circles are there in the red one relative position is really most valuable in in early streets when the pots are multi-way and usually by the river if the pots have grown you're gonna be heads up and once again you're either in position or you're not now I'm so a little story from a session I played last month at Falls View I was playing a two five game deep stack buy-in you can buy in for a thousand dollars and they was getting into the evening the game was loosening up a bit and this guy came to the table who just was really action player he decided he was gonna blind raise every hand from every position you don't get a strategic option when you do that it's not like a straddle you just have to check unless it gets raised ahead of you and I was sitting to his right which isn't the best thing you know I don't have position on this player who is ready to give action and putting a lot of pressure on everyone but I figured out that instead of raising my hands and then giving him the option to take his money back if I limped in he had a check you know how to go through him everyone else had to act and then I could see how everyone was acting before I really made my decision I just limp in for five get all the information that make my decision it's kind of like straddling and it was I thought it was really awesome you know I'm getting all this information I can do limp raises I can do squeezes but what I realized was except for the hands where he was blind raising 230 or $50 where I could get a lot of money in preflop getting two limp call with relative position or even limp raised to small amounts with relative position wasn't that valuable because when we were playing 200-300 big blind deep poker most of the action most of the significant meaningful money was going in after the flop and I was playing out of position on those streets so I realized after about 45 minutes of this that actually despite the fact I thought I had a good position that I didn't have that great of a position and I actually ended up quitting the game because of that which I thought was a little ludicrous I'm like I have a guy blind raising every hand and yet I don't think it's a great spot for me and I realized it was because of my position that the spot wasn't good and this is why the Mississippi straddle where you can straddle on the button is so powerful you get to play a bigger pot with absolute position every hand and you also get to see how the blinds react before you make your decision it's a huge advantage and this is why relative position in my opinion is overrated compared to absolute position now as stacks get deeper the power of position amplifies so I hinted on it a bit there we're gonna dive a little bit deeper on that so how position gets amplified as stocks get deeper so this is a well-known fact among pro players but not so well-known by new players that assuming no rake money when a poker has to come from people who are losing and all things being equal the chips are gonna flow to the left the chips are gonna flow to the players who are in position the chips are gonna flow to the players who have more information and get to act last with more information for higher stakes so first example we have a player who is gonna lose a hundred big blinds in a game and the assumption without factoring position is that all players of equal skill at this nine handed game are gonna split up the money so if this player c1 is going to lose a hundred big blinds then everyone else at the table is going to pick up 12 and a half big blinds right wrong that is not the case because when we factor in position we actually see that the player with direct position on the Dead Money player the weaker player is going to get the majority of that money in expected value with a significant decrease moving to seat three and then four and five and I actually didn't even include seats six seven and eight because they're far enough away that they aren't gonna see much of the profit much most of the profit is going to be acquired by the people who have immediate position on the Dead Money spot the mark whatever you want to call a player at the table and actually seat six seven and eight because they're kind of out of position to the player and see when are actually probably gonna be leaking some of the money to c1 but that we get the chart very complicated so this is kind of the baseline if you have a losing player and everyone else who's equal skill and then as the skill gap comes into play and it's more significant the the graphs would change slightly so these aren't exact numbers but I feel like the visualization helps to illustrate the concept and I'm someone who really likes to do both words and numbers as well as images so that both sides of the brain can get activated and helped to retain the information and this is why coming up when I was really playing tons of hands online millions of hands online we called the seat directly left of the mark that Jesus seat or the God seat because that's the seat that was gonna make the most money and if I could sit in the game with direct position on the weaker player I was all about it and if I was gonna have the worst seat relative to the weak player I wouldn't even sit in the game because I wasn't gonna get any of the profit it was already gonna be gone by the time I got to act on my hand so this is why when you have a choice of seat you want to choose the seat in position on the Dead Money because that is the seat with the highest expectation you can do everything else the same but if you improve your position relative to the weaker players you will win more money there is no buts about it and I had a funny story it falls view I was playing I I moved to another two five table and there was there was you know a spot in the game and I learned on the first hand that this guy was less experienced and we were chatting back and forth and he's like yeah I'm gonna keep an eye on you I want to get you I'm gonna get closer to you so when a seat opened up they're actually two seats open on my left and right he moved directly to my right because he wanted to be close to me and keep an eye on me and I just laughed so hard when he was like I'm gonna get you I'm coming for you sits directly on my right and I just looked and I said good luck brother I wish you all the best cuz you're gonna need it and looking at these graphs just to understand it more the deeper the stocks would be the more we are the more reloads that the player who is gonna donate you know 200 300 500 big blinds to the game whatever it is the more that these bars would stretch out vertically but the ratios would stay the same the thing that would adjust the ratios is the skill gap which we will talk about in the presentation on aggression and betting all right so what about adjusting your stacks as the play gets deeper I'm just going to touch on this briefly because we're very deep into this topic and this is also one that has more to do with selection which we'll cover in the webinar in May but it's always good to plant a seed so right now we're gonna plant a seed a money seed and what do money seeds grow let me know in the chat okay so dead money could mean a lots we're gonna talk about adjusting to dead money so this is just ranges pre ante this is from I believe that I have this in my chapter and excelling it no limit hold'em and in the cash game guide and it's just one strategy you can use for ranges pre ante this is not set in stone the concept is more important than the specific numbers I didn't use solvers to generate this so I don't know if it's exact and it also depends on so many factors what your exact should be so it's not important to get locked in on the specifics but just to understand the concept and when we add Dead Money which could be an T in the game it could be deeper stacks or it could be a bigger skill gap which means there's more money up for grabs I just wrote post ante as an example it's worth adjusting for so you know range one we have the standard opening strategy generalized and then range two is how I originally thought I would adjust when ante because this is something that always you know I struggled with in tournaments and I wanted to know the answer I thought well if there's 67% more dead money I should play 67 percent more hands right so I just increased my range 67 percent by all positions but this is wrong why we talked about it we touched on it earlier in the presentation and it's that in early position the odds of running into a hand and therefore the odds of having a play out of position are still the same when facing eight opponents they're very high and so we should be careful yet you know the odds of getting a race through when facing only two to four opponents are still quite high yes we're gonna run into a hand sometimes but we're gonna get our raise through more often than not whereas we're raising from early position we are not gonna get our raise through more often than not and so we should be more aggressive in position so it's correct to adjust our ranges from all position but only slightly in early position and once we get to late position that's when we really want to jack it up so this is how I adjust my ranges when there is more dead money in the game i if you notice compared between the pre ante graph and the ranges post adjusted for position I am playing more hands from all positions but the increase in early positions is quite small two percent two percent three percent seven percent and then we get to late position it shoots up I would actually you know going back I would make this 18 percent and this 26 percent really just shoots up near the end just taking off in the cutoff and button and if you notice if you count up the numbers the green and yellow charts are the same total percentage of hands between you know your nine spots on the table you're playing the same number of hands with these two strategies but the green chart is not adjusted for position and the yellow chart is heavily adjusted for position and this is what I talked about before for correct loosening up for correct lagging it up this is what my mentor taught me was that you got a respect early position when it comes to late position especially when there's dead money up for grabs you can go crazy and the reason I did include the small blind is because it's so depending on the big blind and you know honestly when the blinds when both lines are super tight you can go even wider you can open 100% of buttons you can open 70% of cut-offs 50% of hijacks and get away with it on certain tables but you can't get away with opening 50% of hands from under the gun almost no matter what because when there are eight players left to act people wake up with hands so again the concept is really key to understand here that we can drastically adjust our ranges when we are a late position and we can do that even more when stacks are deeper so seven years ago or so at the World Series after the World Series of Poker I went with Greg Merson to Jacksonville Florida where he got invited to play a cash game and he was playing something big I think it was either 50 50 100 200 or 100 200 or 400 some huge game in a back room at best bet Jacksonville and he was talking about strategy because the game was really deep and what he told me was that you know the three bet ranges drastically changed so you know if he was out of position facing you know he's in the big blind or the small blinds facing button open from a loose player with a hundred big blind stacks he may 3bet something like 15% of hands which is fairly wide it's pretty much all the Broadway hands and a lot of the you know bigger pairs but if he was 200 big blind steep 250 that number might drop to something like 5 percent and once they got into the 300 400 500 big blind range he was three betting 0% this is the world champion millions of cash games played online super nova le man knew his strategy and he's saying yeah 300 400 big blinds deep I'm not even three betting ace he's out of position because how much money can I get in preflop and now I have to play so many streets huge bets out of position for the rest of the hand not a good look and likewise to counterbalance this in position as stocks get deeper weekend three bets so much wider so for example if you're again taking that loose strategy button versus cut off and you want a three bet that loose open or 15% of hands because you know maybe they're opening 25 35 % hands you want to buy the button you know protect your position and lock it down for the rest of the hand you might three about 15% of hands but once you get to 200 250 big blinds you can up that 25% 300 to 500 big blinds you could go as wide as 35% maybe even more and you know the next year 2013 I was in Macau with Tony he was playing cash games to prepare for the one-drop which he ended up winning and he told me one night he went to go play some cash at the win and he came back 30 minutes later I'm like Tony what are you doing home so like you just you just left for your session he's like yeah I had a really bad seats I was sitting out of position to rage in and he just three about me every single time I opened every single time I opened and I'm like well you know why don't you just for bet him you know like open fewer hands and he's like F when you're playing over 400 big blinds deep out of position if someone wants to make your life hell by three betting you everything or flatting you and then you know making moves on you post-flop there's not much you can do about it other than change seats and this is one of the very best players in the world and he just left the game he's like don't have a good seat players playing very aggressive against me in position deep stack nothing I can do about it and so he quit in position is that powerful because what can you do flat out of position you know Koren Alex Fitzgerald that's the biggest sucker bet in poker what's your other option for bet define your range and still have a massive pot to stack ratio after the flop out of position there's just not too much you can do which is why a stacks get deeper position gets so much more valuable and should be a primary component of your winning poker strategy so again position is two poker well location is to real estate and just like in real estate the bigger the investment which is your stack depth as in property buy the more significant it is position is an expected value multiplier on whatever amount you are potentially playing for okay so come into the close how can we get position more often in profits first thing to do is grab the best seat on the table you want to have the tight players on your left because then you can buy the button more often they're gonna be more predictable and you want the loose players on your right so that you can attack their wide ranges more effectively and you know by the button by three betting those loose players and forcing the players behind you out of the pot next thing to do is follow the game flow notice if people are getting frustrated emotional ready to loosen up and play more hands if they are in the half position on you the natural thing to do is just tighten up and if they aren't continuing to play your wide range of hands huge one look left yet tells this is the biggest thing I talk about this for probably half an hour in my excelling webinar I did with Johnathan on how I got a life-changing tournament score my biggest win ever and it's looking left getting information seeing if people are showing intention tells and showing up plans playing because if someone's planning to play a hand you can fold half of the hands you were otherwise gonna open because most of those hands won't show a profit once you're going to be out of position likewise if people are showing that they are planning on folding their hands you can pretend they're not there and know that your odds of having absolute position for the rest of the hand are that much better likewise some players will not call big raises so in close spots where someone might want to play but they aren't showing they have a super strong hand you can go ahead and make a 4x or 5x raise to get folds in deep stock cash games this works fine and we will dive deeper to that into the aggression lesson because it's a huge topic and there is a fine art to that Beth sizing and finally you want to own the meta game because if people don't want to play with you if you have fear equity over them if they feel like you hold over them they will respect your raises and fault your opens which is ideal because you will get position more often ok and note a little trick about relative position I mentioned earlier is that you can open limp it's a very cheap way to get information from the rest of the table the other option is straddling and that way when people raise you'll be last to act note this should only really be done when there is a maniac on the table or you have a towel because the worst thing to do is limp in with the hand you're hoping to raise and having it go six ways to the flop so really generally don't do it unless you have very strong reason to do so but it's a strategy you can throw in there to get more relative position it's kind of like you know adjusting race size bigger is how you can get absolute position more often and using the smallest raise size or the limp is a way you can get relative position more often so in summary I hope you guys are with me because that was a lot of information and if it just blew by you don't worry there will be a replay you can watch it again or you can pause the video and play it back but I'm gonna summarize it here so that it will solidify in your minds and if you've taken notes congratulations you get five points number one position is a key element of the triple threat and a winning poker formula number two position gives you the information at van and the rights to last action many benefits number three there are two types of position relative and absolute number four please start thinking of the button as the money chip and you will win more money simple as that number five the action and money flows through and to the player in position B the player with the best position and the money is going to flow right to you number six building on number five if you want to loosen up your game exaggerate your position your adjustments to the in position spots don't loosen up from all positions loosen up a little bit from early position if you even want to but loosen up a ton from late position open way more hands on the cutoff and button three bet people when they're opening when you have position and really focus on those late seats where you are almost guaranteed absolute position and there is a very low chance of you running into a strong hand behind you number seven to play in position more often look left get those towels and adjust your raise sizes preflop if you want to know more about this I'm happy to talk about this live towels and relational dynamics metagame is one of my favorite things in poker I absolutely love it 8 the free card play and the free showdown play are only available in position and finally number 9 stack depth is the great amplifier of the power of position the deeper the stacks the more valuable position is the shallower the stacks the less valuable it is but it always has value it always has merits and it's always better to have position than to not have position if you're going to play without position you better have a good reason to like a good hand good odds or a really good read on your opponent and that's it so this has been Evan for making my first webinar on position for poker coaching com and now let me talk a little bit about what poker coaching com is for those of you who are watching this on YouTube perhaps or are watching it through you know you found out about it through my Instagram feed or my stories or my Twitter post or my Facebook post or my email and you're like I know grips but I don't know poker coaching what is poker coaching com poker coaching com is the newest training site on the scene founded by Jonathan little and co-taught with Alex Fitzgerald Matt Affleck and myself Evan Jarvis what I really love about poker coaching com is the fact that they have these interactive poker hand quizzes it's the first training site I've seen that actually has an engaging format it's not just passively you're getting information you're getting downloads of theories and concepts but you actually get to apply them you get to test yourself and you get feedback immediately jonathan has made over 400 interactive poker hand quizzes and myself Alex and Matt are adding new hand quizzes every single week as well so that database is just gonna keep growing and growing Jonathan also has over 30 coaching challenge webinars from his inner circle program and he also has live coaching challenge webinars every month and so do the rest of us instructors about the quizzes they're really great because they get you in the right state of mind they there are a great warm-up it's interactive and forces you to really bring your knowledge there's there's something that happens when we get more engaged in the learning process we were tamed very little when we just listened to things we get a lot more when we write things down so someone wanted to see this slide hit that print screen button so you can capture this slide and then paste it in a paint document and then you can save those notes for later writing down helps us retain more but then thinking things through explaining things gives us the highest level of retention and that's the beauty of these quizzes is you get to test yourself and then you get immediate feedback and you can kind of talk well this is why I did it and and then find out what Jonathan or what Alex or what Matt or what I thought and why we did it and it's not necessarily saying that I'm the coach so what I said is right it's I'm the coach and this is my thought process and this is why I did what I did and you're gonna have your reasons why you did what you did and we can learn from the other perspectives it's not about right or wrong it's about expanding our thought process and learning what other factors to think about I even found what making quizzes myself I didn't like some of the moves I made and I gave myself less points for the play I actually did because I realized in review and thought that there were actually better options out there so a friend of mine who uses these quizzes every time to warm up before a session says the easiest way to get in the zone it's the best way to warm up for sessions it's very fast it's very quick it costs no money you don't have to like drive to a casino to warm up or play online session warm up you can just get in the zone very quickly and poker coaching com has a seven day free trial so you can literally get these quizzes absolutely for free and Jonathan's usually giving out bonuses too so there's a lot of good value to get there on top of that jonathan has as he opened poker coaching com he sadly closed the doors on float the turn comm which was his original training site so Jonathan and I both have something in common is that we go hard on creating content the difference is where I was just like I'm just gonna make all these free videos on YouTube Jonathan's like I'm gonna make some free videos on YouTube but I'm gonna take my 700 videos and put them on a member training site where people are uber serious and over the years he created 786 poker training videos its massive it's over 400 hours of poker videos and when you sign up for poker coaching com which again has that seven-day free trial you get access to all the float to turn videos as well so you get those for free as well for a week and you'll see that this is just an absolute wealth of knowledge that beyond the free trial will pay for itself very quickly because Jonathan is a really great poker mind and a really great teacher and a really great player too so here's a happy member of poker coaching comm you know one a live tournament in Maryland state and said he couldn't have done it without Jonathan Lil's books an online coaching site and a few lucky flops I too have had some wins and Jonathan's tournament books fantastic his webinars fantastic I really love the one he did with Phil Hellmuth reviewing Phil's World Series of Poker Europe main event win and I love his quizzes too so it's it's a real honor to be a part of the site and if you guys want to get your seven day free trial that's where it's at poker coaching dot-com and with all that said thank you so much for watching the webinar I hope you learned some valuable material which is going to help you make more profit in future sessions if you have any questions now is the time to post them in the twitch chat if you are watching this presentation on GoToWebinar and you haven't yet opened the twitch chat please go to twitch.tv forward slash grips GRI psee D and you will see a chat box which is currently popping off with questions and that is where I will be responding to the questions because I cannot see the GoToWebinar chat box it is not that I am ignoring you guys if you're a GoToWebinar chat I just literally cannot see the chat box and I really want to answer your questions so if you have a question and you'd like me to answer it come on over to twitch TV forward slash grips get in that chat box and copypasta your questions and I will get into it okay also if you enjoyed this webinar and you want to get into the next one save the dates mark it on your calendar April 30th at p.m. Eastern Time it's the last Tuesday of the month and I will also be doing my third webinar on May 28th at 8 p.m. Eastern time it's basically the last Tuesday of the month is when you can expect poker coaching webinar from Evan grips Jarvis ok let's see what we got in the question Blizzard says fantastic thanks I have learned these things somewhat by experience but to get this explained like this is very valuable I agree with you 100% having things broken down and a very easy to understand manner makes it a lot easier to retain them and also the reason that I included all the pictures in this presentation is because some people are more visual learners rather than audio learners and words don't really stick with them the same way that images do so I felt that by adding images to the presentation that whether someone's you know left-brained or right-brained whether they do better with you know words or images the concept is clear for both sides of the brain and if both sides of the brain are picking up it's going to be able to integrate and understand it more I also found just in in making the presentation in writing the slides I was getting more insights and then when I added the images I'm like oh man even more insights so anytime we can get back to the basics and really break it down in its most basic elements the fewest components the least needed words it solidifies the understanding in our minds and is a great place to continue to learn from and to build on top of stole Asst says first great webinar thank you question when sitting down at a cash game with no information on anyone what is your thought process for the first few orbits I love when people ask cash game questions like this because that's what I'm about man that's my jam my thought process is to sit down relax and a the game to assess the terrain I know that no poker game is the same and I want to figure things out and figure out what kind of environment I'm in so when I sit down at a table if it's a hundred by blind max I'll usually sit for the max although if I'm trying to keep under the radar I might buy in for 60 blinds and then top up later because one of the things about cash is you can always add more chips to your stack but you can't take them off your stack likewise if it's a deep sack game where you can sit with like 200 big blinds I will almost never buy in for 200 big blinds right away I'll always almost always buy them for that hundred big blind amount and then see if I have good position see if there's a lot of dead money on the table see if the deep stack players are to my right or if they're weaker and if that's the case I'll top-up but if the deep stock players are all the good players or they're all on my left I usually won't add more I'll just sit with a hundred blinds another thing I find is people are a lot more willing to double you up when you have a shorter stack so you know if it's a hundred max gaming buying with 60 blinds a lot easier to get the double up than if you have a hundred and saying when you're sitting 200 blinds deep people are pretty nitty about doubling you up whereas if half the tables got 200 blinds and you're the guy just sitting with a hundred bigs usually they'll give you action so I assess the terrain I sit down I look at the chip stacks I look at how people are stocking their chips to try to get assessments on whether someone is a loser a tight player generally loose players stack their chips up tall and tight players like really needy players I'll have like half stacks like stacks of ten or if someone has like really sloppy chip stacks they're usually kind of a reckless player or just a very action player someone's really organized they're usually more conservative so I'll look for things like that and then I'll try to assess what people's mental state is I'll try to assess who's sharp who's focused who's there to win I'll try to assess who's tired who's Tilted who's drunk who's you know there to gamble there to mix it up and then I'll I'll try to engage in conversation so you get more information you know if I think someone's a reg you know I'll ask you know good game you've been running well like easy game like whatever or if if someone's you know more on the recreational side and they're there to have fun I'll be like you know what are your plans for the evening what are you plans for the weekend I'll keep it casual I try not to UM give away too much about myself but if someone's like hey are you that YouTube guy are you that streamer are you that teacher I'm honest I'm like yes I'm that guy what's your name nice to meet you I don't lie to people at the table but I don't jump in and be like hey guys um Evan Grips job is from YouTube you should check out my videos like I don't do that I just kind of sit down get comfortable a chill it's kind of like you know when you go to a party or when you go to a social gathering you don't try to take the spotlight right away you kind of see where you can fit in you kind of see what's going on you see where the the cool kids are out and where the Chilkat are out you see where the party is and where the quiet zone is you kind of feel out the train and decide where you're gonna hang out and decide where you want to invest your time and energy and it's the same in in poker I kind of try to feel like who's there to be social who's there to play and and how I can work with that you know maybe I can just you know sometimes I go to a poker game there isn't a lot of money on the table but there's someone I can have a great conversation with and I go there to you know socialize and make a friend and maybe learn some things about business and stuff so I really go to just get comfortable take my time play pretty solid pretty conservative for the first few orbits and then when I kind of feel where the spots are when I feel where the money-making opportunity is then I'll greatly extremely adjust my strategy to go after those spots whether that means changing my ranges or straight up changing seats or engaging in certain types of conversation that may you know irritate certain players who are ready to tilt or whatever I'll implement those things into my game so I have everything in my tool belt but I just kind of don't show my cards right away and once I know where my energy and my conversation and my bets are going to give me the highest return that's when I start focusing on those spots have okay a Roush a Russian freak says can you please explain a bit more why position would be more important the deeper stocks aren't the deep stocks allowing you to play more hands okay the main thing that I can talk to speak to about that is generally speaking big pots are for big hands David's clance key and to get you know big bets in 100 big blind bets 200 300 big blind bets you're gonna be looking at more cooler situations so you're gonna be looking at you know like flush over flage boat over boat straight versus sad that might not even get the money in things like that and when you know that how do I put this okay so deeper stock some sometimes like I need a hand example on screen and sometimes I don't have one so it's a little hard to wrap it off the top of my ad but because you have more information about your opponents when you're in position you're more able to avoid the coolers whereas when you're out of position it's harder for you to dodge a cooler and because the bigger pots the deeper stock situations involve more cooler situations being in position is usually going to allow you to get the extra bet whereas being out of position is not going to allow you to get the extra bet and the deeper the stacks are the bigger that last bet is so that's why being in position is more important as stocks get deeper because the last bet that you are going to get is going to be much bigger and all things being equal the person in position is going to get that bet more often than the player is out of position is going to get that bet and so the extra money gained by the player in position is amplified when stacks are deeper versus when they're shallower also when stocks are shallower money will go in more easily with medium strength hands where if roles were reversed both players would have lost the same but in the deep deep stack spots it's really just the big coolers where the money goes in and it's that that being in position allows you get that last bet which is the big bet I hope that explains it well so the deep stacks allow you to play more hands but they allow you to play more hands in position it's also more so than just that like being out of position because of that threat there is so much worse and so the player in position can play more hands because of the threat of that big bet so you can get away with more you know blocker Bluffs single card Bluffs things like that because of the implied threat of that bigger bet and the big advantage I hope that explains it well I may need to use a hand example which I would prep a presentation for but a Russian freak please let me know if that does a decent job of explaining the concept okay MJ richard says how much should we expand our range or 3bet range went on the button our cutoff would you three bet with a 60% range I'm gonna cover more of that in the aggression or this selection lesson it's kind of a blend between aggression and selection but it's probably gonna fit into it's probably gonna fit in this selection lesson because that's gonna be about range construction and stuff and it's hard to give exact numbers because it depends on how loose is the opener what is their strategy when facing a three-bed is it someone who calls a lot of three bets and then check folds flops a lot isn't someone who folds to a lot of three bets is it someone who calls a lot of three bets then check raises flops a lot someone who calls three bets and leads out is it someone who four bets a lot so these are all the factors that we need to consider when deciding how wide we three bet so pay attention to your opponent's opening range pay attention to how they react to three bets and pay attention to what their post-flop tendencies are and with those three factors in mind you'll get a better idea of how much you should widen your three bet range a big thing to think about is just if the player if the player makes a lot of mistakes post-flop and you're very deep stocked you may just want to 3bet them super wide like really wide like any soo today's like almost any suited face like suited connectors suited gapper all pairs all broad ways because you want to get that person heads up with you being in position whereas when you call the other players behind we'll get to play a pot with you so really another thing to consider is do i want to play multi way or do i want to play heads-up and generally if you're super deep stack like four or five hundred big blinds deep with you know a whale you want to play in position with an inflated pot heads up as much as possible so you want a three bet really wide but to give you an exact percentage i just simply cannot do that because there are too many variables to consider MJ richer but i hope i gave you a clear idea of what factors to consider - you know construct your three bet range thanks for the info greatly appreciate it do you have any more handouts I personally don't because I just put together these slides in about mmm two and a half three hours but I can speak with Jonathan about potential handouts that would match the information that we covered in this presentation what is a poker squeeze you talked about a squeeze is a raise when there has been a raise and a call ahead of you a lot of books speak about this I think I probably learned it and no limit hold'em theory and practice bicycle and ski and I don't know if it's Miller or mal Meuse one of those two but a squeeze is when there is a raise and a call and weari raise so a three bet would be there's a raise and we re raised but a squeeze is there's a raise and a call and we re raised and the thinking behind that is we can usually squeeze with a wider range then we could just straight up three bets because the person who flats the open often as a weak weaker range than would have if they three bets so we kind of consider that dead money that's kind of changed over the years and it's really again super opponents specific to decide how wide you should squeeze you need to be aware of your opponent's flatting range versus their 3betting range and what they both look like but that's what it squeezes it's when you reopen the action with arrays after there's been a raise and a call okay J Reagan if early razors typically open stronger how often do you throughout one position with marginal to strong Holdings generally speaking if someone's opening with a really strong range I usually respect it and I usually fold so yes we want to play our position but when early position when a player opens from early position with a strong range I'm often just gonna be folding in that spot but again super situational super specific but generally I would say not often yeah I'd be flatting a lot and if you're really really deep you can throw in some bluffs in there and you know four five suited and eighty five students stuff but like you probably want to be three betting those like ten percent of the time you have them so you always three bet them it's like once in a while you mix in a ace five suited or something but I generally stick to very strong three bet ranges when dealing with early position openers who are playing strong ranges what about trap limping yeah I'm super down the trap limp I limp with aces under the gun all the time but I like to have a dynamic in play I like to know that there's someone who likes to raise the action because it's it's not fun when it gets limped around when it gets limped around I just be careful with my hand you can still get some value with a pair and if no one else limps in and you just play against the blinds you have a decent chance of getting a couple bets out because they're gonna have a hard time folding a pair so I'm all for trap limping I love limping aces and I limp in some some weaker hands as well that I think aren't quite good enough to raise but our hands that I'd like to see a flop with like you know small medium pairs suited aces which can cooler suited connectors some of the weaker Broadway's sometimes I'll limp in King Queen off under the gun ace jack-off under the gun get people to come along with weaker Broadway's weaker aces but I would avoid open limping suited connectors from early position because you're you're setting yourself up to get cooler by suited Broadway's and suited aces will talk a lot more about that in the selection webinar so that's Evans what happens when you're in a tournament situation having a grass player behind you that three bets up frequently i1 do you consider for betting or how tight you should be calling three bets that's a big one it has a lot to do with stock sizes but for example when I was playing the falls view classic and I was on the final two tables two or three tables we were really deep and I had my clay on my left who had won the tournament like twice in the last three years he ended up winning at that year as well and I knew that he's very aggressive I knew that he three-bed a lot so I just I just folded a ton and I just waited for my table to break and I found that because I was opening very infrequently he would let them get through because he's respecting I had a tight range but yeah I generally adjust by tightening up I don't go for the I keep opening and then I'm gonna for bet more I go for the approach of if this guy's going ham I'm just gonna let him do his thing and I'm just gonna wait for my hands because I'm not losing chips by folding I'm still raising you know my ten fifteen percent of hands per orbit that's fine I just you know dial it back from the twenty five thirty five percent I would otherwise be raising if you want to go to battle with them by all means in terms of at what point do you consider for betting you should usually just for bet the first time let him know you ain't going to take that but I can't give a specific one on you kind of got it either you set the tone right away or you just you just feel it out try to pick up itself when you think you might be out of line and go for a four bet terms of how tight you should be calling three bets again it really depends on stock size and the shallower your stock size the less you should be opening unless you're planning to for bet all-in over the three bet but I keep it pretty tight you know East nine ace ten suited plus king queen suited Queen Jack suited maybe Jack ten suited maybe ten nine suited I don't think it's really a big deal to fold those hands to three bets out of position like faces three bit up position just sucks so I'll just fold a lot of hands that I would otherwise open and then just if you're gonna call three bats be ready to play some variance because you're gonna have to check raise those drawers check call a lot of spots out of positions so I guess generally the the shallower I are the shallow where I am the more willing I am to call the three bets out of position because you know at thirty thirty-five big blinds you have a good pot to stack ratio to check shove withdraws check shove with pair and and weak drawers and so the positional advantage isn't as big but 40-50 blinds 60 blinds plus I just really cut down my opening range so that I don't have to face the frequent three bets and I just saved those two two and a half three big blinds for later spots and sometimes I just wait for a table change it's just that's part of the game is is accepting the terrain like that example I had with with Tony where if the guys just gonna 3bet you every hand well wait for a hand that you're comfortable for betting and go into town with and if you get aces maybe think about trapping with it something about a replay how do we watch that I'm gonna talk to Jonathan about that I'm pretty sure the replay will be available but I have to talk to him about it the mark says it may go up on jails YouTube I'm probably I think I'm probably also gonna send out an email about that so grips comm GRI PS IDI calm if you sign up there you'll be on the list and I'll send out an email with information as soon as as soon as I get the go-ahead from Johnathan regarding keeping poor players to your writing cache games I usually worry about seat selection from our relative position to the best players in the game and less so for the worst i I agree with that MJ richer there are very tough players I also like to kind of get on the let them be the meat of the sandwich and let the weak player be one bun and I'm the other bun so I get to see how they all react because yeah even though I have a slightly lower expectation on the weaker player by not being in direct position I have a higher expectation on all the regs by being in position to them so if I can pick up pick off some of the money from them I'm still getting it from the weaker player indirectly through them yeah I like that strategy as well sometimes directly to the fish the weaker player isn't the optimal seat but in a lot of lineups it's going to be what's the base preflop range that was used as a basis for the position adjustment charts it's just the range that I use when I play cash games and it is based on the percentage likelihood of being dealt the best hand so you know if you're under the gun and eight players are left to act and you have a top 11 percent hand you likely are dealt the best hand on the table and therefore putting money in the pot is going to show a positive expectation likewise if you're on the cutoff and there's four players total if you have a top 25% hand odds are you got dealt the best hand on the table and you're gonna make money by putting chips in the middle that was that's that's where I got my chart for cash games for but it's not set in stone and it's probably not like the most optimal up-to-date GTO chart so like I said grab the concept it's a decent baseline but don't get married to the numbers on there okay so if the game gets deeper we care less about opponents who P fold in about hands and continuing with good ones so if the game gets deeper we care less about opponents good ones yeah yeah just the deeper the game gets the more valuable position is and yeah yeah because the deeper the game gets the more important the turn and River play are the later Street play are so it's all about the hands that can make the nuts on later streets and therefore like King Queen off a track off East Queen off East King off even isn't like super valuable because you're not gonna be making the most money playing the biggest pots with one pair hands okay answer it that one that mark says I'll be playing my first big tournament in a couple of months and have to travel to be there what is the most important thing you recommend I do I feel like I did a video on this I have a video about how I won bigoted Falls view that's a good video covering that I also have a video on live preparation but the most important thing if I could recommend one thing yeah find out where the healthy food option is at the destination that you're going to and get there a day early if you can so you can stock up on healthy food clean water find out where the gym is where you can exercise find out places where you can chill out be quiet and get there early so that you can get comfortable walk around the casino or you know the neighborhood the area and just get comfortable so you feel safe and secure and you don't feel like uncertain about stuff the worst thing that can happen is not having food not having quality food not having a quality source of energy when you have to play a long tournament so the more you can know about the area the better probably do some Google research like I'm going to Reno for the first time for that run it up series I don't know anything about Reno so I'm gonna do some Google work figure out what's up maybe rent a car so that I can pick up groceries try to get a room on a lower floor so it's close to the elevators and therefore I could get more rest on break things like that and make sure you get a lot of sleep and make sure you're calm so I would advise doing your studying earlier rather than later don't cram right before you go there by the time you hop on the plane it's time to go the term it's time just chill out relax do what you do to get in the zone you know you can review hands if you want you can do quizzes if you want but don't try to learn new information right before you play trust that if you know enough if you knew enough to get there you know enough to get farther and that by staying calm staying relaxed focusing on your breathing focusing on just feeling good feeling happy feeling your best is what's gonna get you the best results and don't put too much pressure on yourself if the cards are in your favor if the stars align you play well you just might win that thing but if you're going in there being like I need to win and you tell your friends like yo I'm gonna win this tournament all it's not it puts a lot of pressure on yourself in something where you have a limited amount of control because luck is a factor and then that extra pressure leads to extra stress that can lead to judgement when making mistakes so they need some forgivable if you make a mistake and you're hard on yourself you create more tension and stress hormones and more mistakes and like you don't want that so just like chill out have fun relax make sure you're comfortable trust that you know what you need to know and if you have if you're crossing over time zones and you have trouble sleeping melatonin okay rock steady do you adjust your preflop BET sizing in six max cash game online based on stack size um no no I mean generally in the games I play people are playing 100 bigs I just based on position the one time all adjust greatly is if there is a really loose player who's like playing like 80 90 percent of hands and I think that they'll call a bigger raise size I'll make it bigger so when I'm playing in position I can play a bigger pot but we'll go deep into that in the aggression webinar on April 30th can I read this yes if you had a start-over would you play to your bankroll or to your skill level bankroll I think it's too stressful to play outside of your bankroll even though even if your skill is there and stress really eats away at the human and I don't like that feeling so I find that when I'm playing outside my bankroll I just feel very uncomfortable and that's not a good place to be making decisions from so I I would play to my bankroll that's how I built my bankroll over my career I never went broke I'm never going to go broke I have safety I have security I have comfort I have confidence and that's a thing about respecting my bankroll I think playing at the skill level it's fine but it kind of shows a little bit of impatience and impatience in that can carry over to impatience in other places so I think it can kind of be setting up for disaster and well like it can build you up faster can break you down more so the higher you fly the harder you fall kind of thing and if you're someone who is comfortable with that and enjoys those kind of swings and likes the rush of that by all means go for it it's just personally not for me and like I have an extremely addictive personality I'm someone who would go for that kind of stuff but I know how easy I'd get carried away from it so in the interest of just protecting myself and doing what's best for me I don't I played in my bankroll I am very strict with bankroll management and money management and every time I've deviated from that I've seen the snowball effect the domino effect of doing so and it doesn't lead to good things so I played my bankroll for sure is a position significant different from cash games to tournaments it really just depends on stack sizes and yeah stock sizes ante how much dead money and then in tournaments also ICM comes into play which can make position even more valuable but in terms of like the strategies we discussed in today's presentation they apply directly to tournaments the same way they do in cash games the information you just received is applicable in both environments 100% okay cap says I play mostly tournaments and I feel like when I do play cash I play much like I would a tournament standard however I do Bluff a lot less since I play one too and people don't full enough is that a bad strategy nope that's correct generally in cash games it is optimal to play a more value heavy strategy to focus on playing hands that can get paid off and really value betting a lot the reason we Bluff in cash games is generally to get action on our value hands so we Bluff a lot in small pots we can get paid in the big pots this is because stocks are very deep relative to the debt money in the middle and therefore winning the ante stealing the blinds winning pots on the flop isn't really worth that much whereas making the right decision getting paid the maximum on river bets is worth a lot whereas in tournaments where stacks are a lot shallower and therefore the dead money in the middle the blinds and antes are more significant relative to the stock sizes the maximum risk winning the blinds is much more important taking down pots on the flop is much more important winning preflop pots with three bets is much more important and significant and therefore in tournaments we Bluff because winning those pots is is worth a lot it's gonna make the difference between our survival in the tournament and death in a tournament and we so rarely play turns and rivers especially deeper in the tournament that we don't really need to worry so much about making the nuts and and cooler in people we just need to make hands that are the best hand on the flop and occasionally on the turn I hope that makes sense so generally we play optimally speaking tournaments with the dead money and with the shallower stocks favor a more bluff heavy strategy and focusing on winning a lot of pots preflop it on the flop whereas cash games focus on a more value heavy strategy focusing on making better decisions on turns and rivers and thereby the value of acquiring information is much more important in cash games than it is in tournaments hope that answers was I talking about limping AAA and cash or Mt T's I do it in both I've been advised against limping AAA and MTTs and less we're at a super aggressive table I mean it really depends I'm just I'm a big fan of slow playing the Aces it's just it wins a lot final free vyas question where can we see that preflop chart it is in my ebook the cash game guide and I'm pretty sure yeah it's also in excelling at No Limit Hold'em chapter 1 excelent and ultimate Hold'em it's there so you can get it in either book so I know and Hold'em which is available on Amazon and the cash game guide which is exclusively available at grips calm five pillars video yeah that's five pillars video is a great thing to watch in preparation for a live tournament it's gonna help you just feel your best and play your best natural bodies of water will help save you the area that's a good tip macros DJ but well bodies of water in the desert thank you for the great advice love it not expecting anything or putting any pressure on myself at all just want to enjoy it thanks again you're welcome the morgue I wish you the best of luck luck and I hope you have a fantastic experience enjoy yourself Chartier YC in a home cash game I raised the button with a wide range for position the other players have started three or four betting me this is a daily game and we play with each other a lot can I defend without just playing super narrow range on the button I mean how deep are the stocks sharda if the stocks are really deep you can call with the very wide range if the stacks are shallower you probably shouldn't defend as many hands um but if there are three or four betting you a lot and you want to defend more with position you can raise smaller that's an adjustment we talked about you kit you can min raise or 2.5 X 3 X and then there are three bets will be smaller and therefore you'll have a deeper pot to stock ratio and you can defend the other thing to consider is what kind of hands are they three betting with because if there are three betting few hands you probably want to defend a pretty narrow range but if they're three betting a lot of hands and they're widening their range you can therefore widen your range and still have better hands than them your other option is to for bet them and in terms of best hands best candidates for for betting we'll be talking about that in the selection webinar in May how do you go about studying your hand ranges I've tried to create charts just memorize if I stood in the visual charts but it's had to make it stick any other math to use when starting out awesome I just played a lot I just played a lot a lot a lot a lot of Poker I'd look at hand charts and books and I just play and I just I started to get a feel for it and then I just kind of learned like where I could adjust based on the game and then it just became second nature and then I started deviating from the charts and I've actually recently looked at some charts gone like oh I want to make sure I have optimal ranges I'm just like man trying to memorize charts is nuts there's so much information and then I remembered right it's good to know the baseline it's good to have some idea of information on what the worst hand you want to open from each position as I find that's a good trick don't remember all of them just remember the worst hand the old notation we had with you didn't have a chart but you had like a j+ which meant ace jack ace queen ace king are you out like a ts+ which meant ace 10 student in all better suited hints 5 4s plus which meant any suited connector 5 4 are suited and up so you know 6 7 7 8 is just 5 4 3 2 plus deuce is plus so think what is the worst pair I open here what is the worst Broadway hand I open here what is the worst ace what is the worst suited ace what's the worst suited Broadway what's the worst suited connectors suited gapper suited to gapper or in some cases suited face card things like that and just do a couple positions at a time you know do you're under the gun range you're mid position range and your button range your button cutoff ranges are gonna be the most important ones anyway other than your blind defense ranges and then just play a lot play a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot and remember that it's not about getting the exact hands it's about getting close and then knowing that in some cases you open a little wider because you know there's tight players behind or there's a weak player on the blind another position in the situation is you open tighter and start to get situational awareness and then you can throw this starting hand chart away because you have an idea of what the baseline is but you are in you focusing on the more important thing which is how likely I might have position this hand Who am I most likely playing against in this hand and do I have the type of hand that will do well in either a heads-up or a multi-way pot and am i setting myself up for a heads up or multi-way pot and I would really ditch the memorization I was a big memorizer in school I was really good at all that stuff so it's like oh let's you know carry that over to poker hands just it's a dynamic game once you have a general understanding of it I don't think it's important to memorize the charts specifically maybe some of the very best players in the world would agree with me but unless were out there playing super high rollers and stuff it's probably not necessary to be that exact and there are probably better ways to use your mental energy also know that when you're being strict and rigid with yourself you're draining yourself of energy and when you're more relaxed you have more creativity flowing through you you have more openness you have more intuition and more energy available which is going to help you make better reads on later streets and ultimately help you make more money than you know playing one pip too weak like you know ace 7 off instead of ace 8 off kind of thing that's not going to be the end of the world but you know beating yourself up about missing it or weren't wondering too much and worrying too much about not being exact is going to get a lot of stress hormones in your body which is gonna make you feel uncomfortable which is gonna lead to probably making more significant mistakes down the road so don't worry too much about getting it perfect just enjoy getting practice and know that the more you play and the more you review the more you are going to get it you know get it down okay what are implied odds implied odds or the potential payoff you can get on a hand that's a pretty long topic I have a whole video on that if you search YouTube for the triple threat the Mavra it talks about implied odds for about 10 or 15 minutes in the aggression section I believe so that'll allow you to go really deep on it because it's a very very helpful thing for sure and yeah it's the potential payoff you know if you make your flush how much money will you make with your flush if you you know hit your set on the flop how much money can you expect to get paid and then there are reverse implied odds which is if you make a hand but it's a second best hand how much can you expect to lose and that video the triple threat on YouTube will take you deeper into that not as deep as we went today this was the deeper dive then the triple threat has but that's a good starting point and we will go deeper on that in the selection webinar in May okay thanks Evan thank you thank you so much thanks I've been looking forward to the next series you're all very welcome ok the replay on YouTube I'm not sure we will communicate everything via email and Twitter so grips poker on Twitter is me and Jonathan little on Twitter is John little local cash game allows 200 big glam Byun if we starting to you by and fuller start a hundred double through debt money I start for a hundred in less and if I see that the players on my direct right are sitting deep and they're weaker players I will usually top up to cover them but I'll generally sit him for a hundred big blinds if I lose some chips I'll top up to 100 I'll top up to 100 I'll top to 100 and then just wait till I double if the players to my right are sitting 150 and they're weaker players I'll top up to 150 and if you know they're sitting with two three four five hundred lines and they're clearly worse players than me I clearly have a big edge and a half position on them I'll just sit with two hundred but I will wait until I have you know certainty about that because looks can be deceiving before I buy them for two hundred because I said before you can always add chips to the table but you can't take them off and do I defend blinded cash games like tourney's it does it not matter because you can leave change seats no the defense strategy is different because of the addition of added debt money with antes and also because stack size is changed the optimal defending ranges so we can defend wider when we're shallower and then depending on how close we are to the money there's ICM considerations which affected so there are more variables in play in tournaments that affect my defending range and also how I choose to defend whether it's passively with calls or aggressively with three bets so definitely different strategies okay thank you good information you are most welcome hypno Bou memorizing the worst hands and the opening range test is hugely helpful I should have thought to try doing that instead hey man the more you thought of the best thing which is asked the professional who's done this before what they did and then you don't have to figure it out yourself that's what learning is all about much more simple than remembering a picture thank you so much and welcome to poker coaching you deserve it looking for a table of may thank you so much the morgue it's it's it's an honor and a pleasure to be a part of this team great webinars kudos to you and John for making this happen thanks Evan glad you are part of poker coaching thanks ice blade that the real ice blade I want to give a shout out to my top ten maybe okay are there any other questions we are way over time which is kind of standard for me I really like to give a lot Jonathan asked me to do two webinars this month I'm like no man I can only do one because it takes so much out of me but honestly what I put in here probably could have been two webinars so you guys kind of got a two-for-one you'll probably get a two-for-one on April 30th and you'll probably get a two-for-one on May 28th as well because that's just how I roll so I hope you guys enjoy and I hope you guys appreciate it and okay we go one more question can you go over the thing about the guy in the WSOP with aces I am not sure what you're referring to macros Oh Greggy greggy's the guy who won the main event oh okay yeah I was just talking about how as stacks get deeper the value of position goes up and therefore we it is correct to narrow the range of hands we three bet with from out of position because although we're building a pot out of position we aren't going to be able to get all in you know by the turn or maybe the river and therefore the player in position has a big advantage over us so rather than three betting and building up a pot that we're gonna play out of position where the player in position has a bigger advantage as the stacks get deeper it is actually correct to flat call more of your hands from the big blind and three bet fewer hands and it actually gets to the point where once you're three four five hundred big blinds deep many professionals consider it incorrect to three bet even a hand as strong as aces unless you know the game is playing so huge where people are opening for you know eight blinds on the button and you can three bet two like 40 blinds and they'll still call but if we're talking standard sizes you know to and after three and a half opens and three bets to you know seven and a half to ten big blinds because there's still so much play behind and your hand is becoming pretty clearly defined it's better to not three about those hands and put yourself in position and actually just flat to defend with majority of your range if not all of it and you're yeah you're playing a smaller pop but your hand is disguised and when you're that deep out of position it's very hard to stack your opponent anyway you're much more likely to get stacked and therefore better to keep the size of the pot small with hands even as strong as aces was what we were discussing there and that's something that I learned from the 2012 Main Event champion and Player of the Year Greg Merson who was a mentor of mine and also a good friend as we lived in an apartment together in Toronto in 2011 after meeting at the World Series of Poker the summer before you might say it was a match made in heaven that's applicable when it's deep stack when the body it's applicable when it's deep stacked because when the blinds are huge the stacks are actually shallow so it's not so much about what the blinds are it's about how deep the stacks are okay well done and well-spoken clear concise info Thank You Jay Regan okay last chance to get questions in people coming up on my bedtime so if there are no more questions I am ready to crash what's my favorite color well some people would say it's not a color it's a shade my favorite color is white the most rich color of them all it contains all of them it's the color of the Sun some might say it looks like it even though if you do and it looks orange but it's the color of the moon which is one of my favorite things in the universe and I've just always loved the color white I find it just such a soothing color to look at and my second favorite color you know I feel like I can't pick a shade you got the color purple purple I love purple and white and then blue would be next so if anyone studies chakras I'm very upper chakras or Ian TEDWomen the top red being the second from the top and blue being the third from the top appreciate your time and info going to join polka coaching and learn more awesome awesome I think I don't know for sure I have to ask Jonathan but I'm pretty sure if you guys want Jonathan to

sense that I'm gonna folk putting a lot of really high quality stuff into poker coaching Crispo coaching packages permission maybe your promotion maybe you know I'll talk to Jonathan about it he's a very creative guy he knows how to structure deals and arrangements and promotions and packages and giveaways and stuff so I'm sure that he and I will come to something that is mutually beneficial for both of us and most importantly maximally beneficial for the students because regardless of where you guys are learning as long as you're getting better and you know as long as when people ask you just say the name you know I learned from Jonathan little I learned from heaven Jarvis doesn't matter whether it's at grips calm or float the turn calm or poker coaching calm the main thing is that you guys are getting better and if people ask that you're happy to share who you learn it from and our personal names are more important than our brand names and we appreciate any referrals

of manifestations real don't be surprised if you see me posting pictures on Instagram at grips from the Hard Rock Hotel in puts Kanna living the dream it's so I believe I believe it can happen so it's just a matter of focusing and energy doing good quality work and being patient with the process Rocksteady says thanks for your time tonight you are welcome brother thank you for your time as well thank you everyone who invested your time tonight to spend with me I know you could have been anywhere in the world but you're here with me and I appreciate that and yeah I really look forward to

[Document(page_content="as always want to thank everyone for showing up and coming to watch the webinar I got a fun topic today it is big blind defense in tournaments this is a very important part of tournament poker you're gonna be facing it's one of the more common situations you're gonna face where you you know you post your big blind you're gonna be facing a raise and you know you have to be playing a lot of hands because you're getting a great price and it's a spot where you can lose a lot of equity in tournaments and gain a lot of equity in tournaments and the better players definitely play these big blind spots much better than the weaker players and you're always gonna be a losing player out of the big blind that's the important part number one you're always gonna be losing because no matter what you always have to put one big blind in the pot but your goal is to minimize how you lose and you should be losing less than one big blind because we're gonna be making positive expectation place after we post that big blind so the key thing for us is going to be that you know we're trying to minimize how much we lose posting our big blinds in this ends up being a big part of our win rate in tournaments so this webinar topics came from a question that I got on Twitter how do I properly defend my big blind in tournaments when facing a raise with multiple callers so some of the topics that we're going to cover today are heads up defense so this is going to be defending your big blind when you are facing a single raise both from early position which will consider like an 18% opening range and from late position which will look at like the cutoff which is somewhere around a 30% opening range we're gonna look at multi-way defenses so this is going to be say when someone open up sin early too early position and then the button calls and now you're the third player in the pot or say when the cut off calls the button calls and then now you're the third player in the pot sorry the cut off raises the button calls and now you're the third player in the pot so all these situations and ranges are going to affect how we play and what types of hands we play a lot so we're gonna look at how we adjust our defense ranges at various tap decks so really looking at a hundred big blinds and forty big blind play we're also gonna be looking at three bedding and what types of hands we should be 3-betting from the blinds I want a couple of things to point out all the examples are gonna assume a one big blind ante most tournaments seem to have moved to the big blind ante if you're playing online it's normally about a one big blind ante live it's of one big blind Annie and you should be making adjustments if you're playing with no antes such as in a cash game or if you're playing with no antes early in the tournament I think all tournaments just start with an e of T and we play 90% of the tournaments with an ante so we're not gonna bother looking at the two levels of the tournament we play without antes just make your adjustment adjustments and play tighter all ranges that I present are gonna be basic ranges you should always be making adjustments to these ranges whether it be being tighter or looser depending on the skill levels of your opponents and how tight they are how loose they are and then also we're gonna assume all ranges are all raises are a two and a half times the big blind open you're gonna be making a lot of adjustments whether it's a men race to 2 X 2.5 or 3 X and 2.5 x open is a kind of a middle ground to look at just too much material to cover if we look at all the different opening sizes so you just have to use your intuition and make the proper adjustments if you're facing a min raise you're obviously going to defend wider if you're facing a 3x you're obviously to defend much tighter some of the biggest mistakes that you see are people under defend their big blind facing a single razor so players are much too tight out of their big blind when they're facing a single razor you're getting a very good price to call and you should your closing the action so you should you can be calling with quite a few hands people do not 3bet enough from the big blind versus late position opens this is a very big mistake late position openers have very wide ranges and you need to be punishing them and getting good value from your good hands and pick it up pots preflop without having to go to the flop out of position is going to help improve your equity in tournaments to go along with that people are severely unbalanced in their three betting ranges from the big blind people only tend to the average player in a 300 hour live tournament is never three bet bluffing from the big line they only three bet like the strongest of hands like ace king and jacks or better and as you'll see in this webinar that is not the correct strategy and I will hopefully help you with that to get you a more balanced three betting range and it's gonna help you a lot because as I said the biggest mistake people make is they're unbalanced so players are used to playing against players with unbalanced three betting ranges so if you start three betting with these more balanced ranges you're gonna get a lot of equity because they're not used to seeing you three about hands that are Bluffs and then the final biggest mistake we see is they don't adjust their ranges versus various race sizing positions or skill levels of opponents so you should be adjusting your ranges versus obviously the 2x to the 3x that we talked about the position of the opener so we're gonna look at both early position and late position and also you should be adjusting your ranges based on the skill level opponent is very strong players you'll want to defend a little bit tighter you can fold more of the marginal spots against weaker players you can defend wider because you're going to realize more equity so let's get into the meat of this PowerPoint first situation we're gonna look at is big blind defense facing a single razor from early position so we're gonna look at an 18% opening range this would be like a anywhere from like under the gun one under the under the gun under the gun one under the gun to somewhere around there I guess you're really tight players maybe this is a middle position opening range but you get the point we're gonna look at one hundred big blinds and so this range hand grid here is a kind of sample range of what I would be looking at defending versus an early position raise and we have the call the three bet Bluff and the three bet for value and as you can see we are not three betting much at all so one of the things they said is that people don't 3bet enough from the big blinds this is true versus late position against early position you really don't want to be three betting very much at all and there's a couple reasons why one is we're getting a really good price so they raise to two point five big blinds we have to call one-and-a-half big blinds to win five big blinds so we're getting just under three and a half to one that means we want to call with a lot of hands and since we want to call with a lot of hands we're gonna be using a very polarized three betting strategy to protect our like flouting range we want to kind of have a lot of strong hands in our flattened range because we're getting a good price and that allows us to kind of flat some of these crappy hands like seven three suited six deuce suited Queen deuce suited Jack their city etc so for value we're just gonna be fighting aces and kings Ace King suited notice Ace King off is going to be a flat call you can three about it that's fine these are kind of not hardened you know just like my last webinar these ranges aren't by rule we have one person can anyone else hear the microphone we had one person say they can't hear I think it's just yourself Jim and other people claim that they could hear yeah I think it's just you Jim make sure your volume is up on your computer so these aren't they're like just like I explained in the last webinar these aren't hard like rule ranges it's more the types of hands you want to be looking at so aces and Kings Ace King soon everyone our three betting the main thing you want to keep in mind here is we're three betting very tight out of the big blind we're facing a tight opening range so we have two three about tight overvalue and you know hands like queens and Jack's yes we can three bet for value that is definitely gonna be a positive play but you will make more money I believe flat calling with these hands against most opponents and then check raising a lot of flops most opponents don't put you on these stronger hands they think you're gonna three bet and it allows you to play a wider range from the blinds that you have a lot of these weaker hands in your range as well ace king off is just gonna I liked flouting this hand from the big blind because your three bet looks extremely strong from the big blind and hands like ace Queen off ace jack-off a sent off all weaker aces like should be folding like a saint suited should be fold into your three about a seven suited so you're gonna be folding out all these hands that dominate you if you start folding three betting like Ace King off ace Queen off so we're doing very little three betting versus early position now we obviously want to counter these Bluffs we have sixteen value combos as you can see here the types of hands we want to be three buddy in our hands that play very well post flop and can make strong hands so we got the ace five suited the seven six suited the six five student again these aren't hard rules of you have to three about these hands over time but these are the types of hands to eight seven suit it's five for suited seventy five suited ace five h4 suited those are the types of hands are gonna be three betting I gets the early position open now let's take a look at the flouting range the flatting range we're calling almost any two suited cards we're just holding the seven deuce suited 8 deuce nineties 10 deuce this is some of the suited threes and the nine for student basically anything they can't make a straight or a top pair so you're gonna be probably doing fine against most opponents just you can almost call any two suited cards but the key thing I want you to look out here is the offsuit hands one of the biggest mistakes I see players now is they know they should be defending wide from the big line but from early position they defend way too wide against early position openers from the big blind look at how many of the offsuit hands were folding h4 off ace three off ace deuce ace seven off a six off king eight off all these suited King or off suit Kings down to King nine only the off suit nines were defending and then these connectors you know down to five four off and the reason is is we're playing a very against a very tight range and a hand like seven five off suit a lot of times is gonna have to under cards an eighteen percent range isn't even opening like pocket fours at a hundred percent frequency they're gonna be 18% ranges folding like pocket deuces threes and fours you're gonna be dominated you're gonna be making worse pairs and your equity realization is very very low when I say equity realization I'm talking about yeah seventy five off against Ace King has I don't know thirty seven percent equity something like that but in reality you don't that's if the hand is checked down to the river that's not gonna happen you're gonna fold the best hand a lot of times you're gonna fold equity you might only realize of that thirty eight percent you might only realize like twenty percent of your equity so these off suit hands play very very poorly against early position openers so you can be defending very very tight one thing I like to point out to people if depending on how strong and how confident you are in your post flop skills a lot of these borderline defends like five four off six five off ace five off you know the borderline ones eight four suited ten four suited they're all very like marginal Evi so you're really making a very very little bit of money maybe you're making a tenth of a big line maybe even a couple hundredths of a big line but they're still positive so what I would say is if you're not very confident yet and your post-flop skills start folding these weaker hands like h5 off a say it off even ace nine off call these off suit nines and then all these like connected cards one gap or off suits start folding them and as you get more comfortable playing post slop and navigating these marginal situations you can start adding them back in but depending on like your confidence level you don't need to be taking all the marginal spots you can kind of fold the tighter parts of this range see a few questions coming in and will take care of those at the end of the webinar we'll have a good twenty or thirty minutes to answer questions now it's like a big blind defense facing a single razor from late position so we're looking at a cut off open around thirty thirty five percent maybe this is a really tight button opener maybe it's a loose hijack open but it's kind of a good middle ground to look at again hundred big blinds first let's look at the three bedding range now we have a lot wider three bedding range we're three bedding tens plus ace Jack suited plus ace Queen off plus king queen suited that brings us to seventy combos here of the three bet for value and now we're having some three met Bluffs and this is where one of the big mistakes that people come in is they only three bet the tens plus ace Jack suited ace Queen off and then if you're in position you just get to fold everything or you flat your seven six students your pocket sixes pocket fives against them and you play very very it's so easy to play against them when the board comes like low cards you just start putting so much pressure on them because they don't have any board coverage on those those low boards so we want hands though like we are going to be three betting from out of position from the big blind so our three about Bluffs we still want to have a decent amount of equity and these are gonna be hands that are you know close between calling and three betting so they need to be strong enough to three bet put more money in the pot and we like to three bet like this section of the range that is all in blue you don't have to three bet these exact hands but these kind of middling suited connectors have six to ten eight seven nine eight ten nine suited like you never really don't see people through bedding ten nine suited but two really good hand to three bet from the big blind cuz hands like ace ten off King ten off Jack ten off Queen ten off ace nine off Jack nine suited the Queen nine suited maybe you get folds from tight fold so you can generate a lot of folds from hands that dominate you all these suited connectors sort of when gaffers use suited to gaffers if you want a three bit like the ten nine suited so these King eight students are good even I have him as a call in this range you get three about some of these can't see that Queen eight suited ace five suited ace four suited and as I said before people are used so players only three betting the tens through aces like ace queen through ace Jack suited part of the range and kind of ask yourself when was the last time you saw someone three bet you know nine seven suited from the big blind against the cutoff open I think 90% of people I would say in your $300 tournament 97% of them flat nine seven suited so you can get away with a lot of what's the word I want to say you can just get a lot get away with all time more than you're supposed to buy three of any in these hands you usually start taking down pots preflop but you're also gonna win some really really big pots post-flop with these seven six and nine seven studio type three bets because people don't expect you to three bet those hands and then you got the ace 5h4 shooter those are kind of the standard three that polar hands flouting worth plotting more the off seat stuff now because we're getting too late position open and they have a wider range we can flap more hands all they off suit aces are now calls whereas before we were folding all these other than ace five off more off suit Kings all the off suit eights now but we're still folding a good chunk of the off suit part of the grid here now we're gonna look into spots that get a little more complicated a big blind defense facing multiple callers so the first situation again this is gonna be a hundred big blinds we're looking at early position open middle or early to middle position open and then a button flat call now this is a really big mistake people make is now they so they under defend facing a single raise but they over defend when they're facing a raise and calls so it's the opposite now because look how much tighter our defending range is now in this one we're folding 60% of hands and in this one facing the earlier we were folding 51% so we're getting a better price now because there's more money in the pot but we're folding more hands and why why is that it's because of equity realization yes we're getting a better price but three ways our equity realization of hands like say seventy five off suit that we talked before goes down even more because there's three people that means there's two people in the pot now that can have us dominated there's you know that flat collar is gonna have a lot of pocket pairs like pocket eights pocket nines now we have really poor equity with seventy-five offsuit these jack five off suits when you face a hand range or like let's look at Queen seven off like Queen seven officer you could be facing like it's very likely someone has ace Queen King Queen Queen Jack and then also you're seven might not be good because you're gonna see pocket eights pocket nines pocket tens by the second player a lot so where you end up just realizing very poor equity were folding more or the student stuff now ten five suited more of the suit of junk is gone all these off suit aces are gone all these officer Kings are gone off suit long gobblers are gone so we're folding more and the other thing is our three bit range has changed now because there's a extra money in the pot so now that there's a flat call in the pot of an extra two big blinds we have more incentive to 3bet and take the pot down now also that flat collar has a weaker range because they didn't choose to 3bet and so we're much more likely it's kind of dead money in the pot in a way so for value we're squeezing with hands like tens jacks Queens Kings aces ace Jack suited Plus Ace King off king queen suited for value and three bet Bluff is kind of already said someone made a comment Matthew made a comment about is ace Queen off so you really a bluff it's a bluff and this sense of bluff isn't the right word to use when squeezing because preflop you really don't have any Bluffs at all because you still have equity the only real like situation you have like true Bluffs is like kind of on the river when everything is already decided you know if you win the pot or not but in these preflop spots you want to be three betting hands that are gonna play well post flop if you do get called ace queen offsuit is a hand that plays very very well at a shallow SPR so as we learned from my last webinar ace queen offsuit plays much better at an SP r f5 than it does and is an SPR of ten it's easier when it's a SPR of five it's easy to get the money in when it comes Queen our ace high you're very confident also when you for bet when you get for bet it's likely ace king is a very big chunk of the range and so these three bet Bluffs as I put our kind of these are kind of hands that you're just gonna be folding to a four bet once you squeeze and but the thing is is you're not gonna get four bet very much people don't for bet often enough and people don't see people squeeze very often out of the big blind so when they do squeeze from the big blind it's often a very tight range that they see and so they don't for bet very much they normally just called so there's gonna be a linear three betting range east Queen off ace ten off all these suited Broadway's ten nine suited eight seven three to seven succeeded h5 seated these are the types of hands we're gonna be squeezing someone asks about the different 3bet sizings yeah we're gonna get into that in a second but my squeeze size is probably gonna be about 5x the open from the big line so two and a half two and a half we'll probably make it at about twelve and a half you can even be making it like 14 you should be making it pretty large and three betting these like Jack ten suited 10 9 surges are really good again cuz hands like King Jack off King Jack suited ace 10 you're gonna get a lot of folds from dominated hands or hands that are better than yours so and then just keep in mind again facing early position and a call we're defending pretty tight we're defending tighter against multiple callers then we are against single callers that's the biggest concept here I can't count how many times I see a raise and a call and people are calling with King 7 off suit because they're getting a really good price King 7 officer is trash in a multi-way pot three ways I would rather you defend six three suited five three suited I know I don't have six three suited someone asked why do we call five do student but not six restated the five deuce to date these hands are all borderline in here I don't care it's not a big deal if you call a 6-3 suited I probably do but the five do suit it has a little extra implied odds to call with because you can make a wheel when it comes like a three four and someone can have a skinny Queen so you can win a really big pot that way so these wheels suited connected cards become very good versus the six risa there you're going to see you're gonna run into a lot of bigger pocket pairs when there's a flat collar in the middle of you so again I'll hammer home defend tighter multi-way than you do heads up because you have less equity realization changes a little bit when it's cut off and button you're still defending tighter than you did against the original cut off open but now you've got a cut off open bet and call this goes along with the early position raise we have a more linear squeezing range versus multiple callers one like I said we want to protect our equity with dead money in the pot there's a dead two and a half big blinds and button it's not dead but it's a weaker range and it will likely fold to the squeeze and to when there's a third person in the pot we're less concerned with protecting our flatty range and what I mean by that is when we're in heads-up pot so let's say we go to a flop in a heads-up pot where we check the see better only has to worry about us and if we don't have any strong hands in our range you know it's very easy to play against us they can kind of blast away and we're gonna be putting a lot of spots by the turn in the river but when there's a third person the button is kind of protecting us so in this spot the cutoff can't just blindly see bet against us in the big blind because he has the button who has position on us and you know say that the cutoff wants to see about half pot if it's a heads-up pot we have to defend when he bets half pot we have to defend 67 percent of our range now when it's three ways between the button and the big blind we have to defend 67 percent so the burden is kind of on both of us and mostly on the button for the cutoff not to exploit both of us hopefully that makes sense but there's the the mdf the minimal defense frequencies don't change but now there's two people that are kind of sharing the MDF and so that's why we're a little less concerned with protecting our flatting range and we just squeeze a lot more linear and again here 3bet bluff is kind of a term I use in quotations because they're not really Bluffs because we have a lot of equity these are still good hands that were 3betting but they also play very well in three wet pots so now we're squeezing like ace 10 student pocket nines ace jack-off king queen off all these suited nines suited Broadway's and I don't think you see anyone squeeze this wide are the big blind and I think you're just gonna get away with bloody murder like squeezing these types of hands people are just going to play so poorly against you're squeezing range we're defending more the suited grid a few more aces but again we're just fooling all this offsuit junk so again all this officer junk is really trash three ways fold it suited stuff is really good and so I'm in these like offsuit connectors they can make straights are also very good someone asked SPR that was from my last webinar SPR is stacked to pot ratio so just it's a ratio of how much money is left behind on the flop versus how much money is in the pot shorter stacks so shorter stacks equals higher equity realization we can defend almost any two cards once our once our stack is below 20 big blinds because we have almost a hundred percent equity realization once you defend with less than 20 big blinds we can stack off post flop with any draw any middle pair of better and this is a key point you want to jam hands that can get called by worse hands so by worse I mean hands that you dominate and you want to jam hands they can get better hands to fold so I said 40 big blinds were actually look at 20 big blinds here big buy defense 20 big blinds in early position open we are flatting very wide wider than we would with a hundred big ones because of our equity realization we're now calling every suited hand and these green hands are gonna be the all enhance notice we're flatting with aces it's gonna help protect our flattering range a little bit ace queen or better we're shoving pocket sixes you're better and then we shove a few of these King 10 seeds Queen ten suited Jack 10 10 9 they have those properties that like now we get King Jack suited to fold King Jack offsuit King Queens gonna fold ace Jack East Queens should be folding 2r shoves same with a spot sooner we get a bunch of better aces to fold and we're just calling and we're very protected now on these ace high board's Qinghai boards I think people shove too wide in the spot they shove like start shoving any ace and then when they do when the board comes ace high they're kind of screwed and the person just gets a bet pretty crazy on them xx big blinds versus the cutoff similar thing we're defending extremely wide and now we're only folding 20% of hands we're calling 80% of hands and we're shoving a lot more the better suited aces the better off suit aces were shoving King Queen we're gonna shove now because we can get called by like King Jack suit in King Jack offsuit we're still shoving some of these like King 9 suited King 18 7 some of these suited ace suited nines because they can get better dominated hands to fold and then obviously you always want to be shoving pairs are the best hands to shove you know when you have 5 you want to shove and get Jack 10 off suit to fold that's a huge win for you so we really like shoving these pocket pairs I'll talk a bit I don't have a slide on it because we don't have time but if you're playing like between twenty and a hundred big blinds so let's say 50 big blinds same type of things apply but with 50 big blinds say you're squeezing range here it won't be it's gonna be a lot more like not these eight seven students and stuff like our last webinar we talked about hand play ability now you'll start squeezing these King 10 off suits King 9 off suits a Sayed off suit ace 9 off through these hands he can make really good top pair of hands but also have that property of getting more dominated hands to fold so you're squeezing range your three betting ranges are just gonna change a little bit when you get to 50 big blinds from a hundred if you take that information from the last webinar if you didn't watch it I recommend going back it should be on YouTube in a summary before we get to questions for a single raiser make sure you are not over folding your big blind if you're not comfortable post-flop eliminate the bullet border borderline defense until you are multi-way make sure you're not over defending you're off to you combinations make sure you value balance your three bets with appropriate Bluffs don't worry about the exact combos but more the type of combos to bluff with on the short stack defend wide and check jam the flop wide again like we said middle pair better any draw are going to be doing just fine and then pay attention - what combos you want to jam with with 20 big blinds you can read a man of hands profitably from the big wine with 20 big blinds but a lot of hands are gonna be more profitable to flat call with rather than Jam you want that property of folding out dominating hands and also getting dominated hands to call this webinar is brought to you by poker coaching com I just want to remind everyone that you can try poker coaching com free for seven days right now I'm making hand quizzes on there I have that monthly - monthly webinars I'm also doing four written articles a month myself Alex Fitzgerald and Jonathan

in his monthly homework webinar there's also big discounts on the three year membership you get access to a bunch of Jonathan's prior his library of webinars that he has on his website is absolutely insane I don't even know how many hours of webinars he has on there but with a three year subscription you get a big discount over them the yearly price and you also get to access to a few of his past webinars again I really think the content out there is well worth the money it doesn't take you know if you're playing 300 all our tournaments if you can improve your win rate by 10% 20% which i think is very very realistic thirty to sixty dollars it's only gonna take you about five tournaments to make the money back so I think you know putting the time and the investment into your game is really important now we're gonna take a look at questions I'm gonna go back through some of these questions they've been asking but if you have any questions we have about 20 minutes I'm going to go through and answer a bunch of questions yeah so Matthew rebel asked about I wouldn't three about the Queen Queen in the early position again it's profitable the three back Queen Queen there it's not a mistake you can be doing it definitely some percentage of the time but I think it's gonna be more profitable or it's very close and Evi to flat call and I think Queens just make ends up making a very good flat calling here three about sizings so out of position from the big blind we're gonna be three betting in the single raised pots where we're the only person it's one race we're facing one raise we're gonna be making it between four and a half to five times the big blind we're four and a half to five times the opening range when we're a hundred big blinds deep and against the squeezing we'll probably be making it maybe a half big blind or half times more so someone opens two and a half X and there's a raisin to call you have to make it a ton bigger if we're making it four and a half x over a single open we'll probably make it five x over the open and the call Matthew ray blasts I'm stadium more inclined to defend with the one Gabor's multi way although less with weaker races that is good I mean I think the one gaffers are very close you're gonna be making less and nuts traits with the one gaffers and but the student the offsuit aces are just really trash multi-way what adjustments would you make if you have a lot of flat callers who sell them fold at the table James ask the adjustment you make is you want to be calling those hands that play really well multi way so you want to be calling with connected hands and you want to be calling with suited hands and you really want to avoid playing those trashy offs you like King eight off type of hands David Gonzalez asks why not ace ace I'm assuming using the twenty big blind the 20 big blind section why are we not shoving with aces and with aces if we shove we're gonna get a lot of hands to fold that we don't like so there's a big difference between aces and Kings like we shell with Kings any folds ace 9 offsuit it's not a big deal with us because he could have hit ace on the flop we need some protection from her hand but with aces we need no protection at all and we don't want them to fold King Jack offsuit to our raise we want to our shove we wanted to see a flop and the flop to come King or Jack high so now we're gonna double up and the the pots gonna be six big blinds and we're going to have seventeen and a half big blinds back so it's very easy to get the money in so there's no need to really be shoving with aces and people are just gonna stack off with any top pair of middle pair so flighty Nations is very good when you're a short stack Greg SX do I have all these ranges memorized any tricks to remember them all no I do not have all these tricks these ranges memorize but like I said before it's not about memorizing the exact combos it's about memorizing the type of hands and so I know versus early position like I don't want to be defending a lot of Austin Kings I know somewhere around King nine off King it off is the you know border line I'm not worried about knowing as long as you're in like within like a Pipper to like I know it's around King nine King eight off you're gonna be doing just fine you don't need to memorize it Daniel I see your question here I actually got the email from Jonathan I was just gonna answer that so Daniels question was he's playing at a tournament and he's in the big blind early position opens to ten times the big blind at 150 big blind so he opens to 1,500 and the button calls and we have King Queen off suit and he was wondering if she should be calling with King Queen there versus the 10x open and we can kind of use a couple of concepts here one against the larger ray sizing we're going to be defending a lot tighter so we know we're gonna be defending type with King Queen off suit we're playing like 175 big blinds deep so the question is yes we should fold King Queen we should never call with the king queen to the 10x open to go further though what types of hands should Daniel flat with against the 10x open from early position and a flat call when they're like 150 plus big blinds deep you just want to be calling with hands that can make the nuts very easily and play very well multi way in a bloated pot so those would be your pocket pairs you know talking fours five six and seven eight nine ten try to make a set your student connectors you're suited broad ways that can make you know flop over cards and nut flush drawers and stuff like that so you're gonna be defending really tight but I would do something like ace Jack suited plus pocket pairs and then maybe a few of the seven six suited but you just don't have to be calling very much when someone makes it ten times the open so Matthew rebel ass should be blind defense Rangers be tighter in cash games yes because cash games are not played with antes and in tournaments you defend really wide because there's an extra one big blind in the pot in the ante which allows you to defend very wide so you will to be defending much wider from the big blind at tournaments than you do in cash games due to the antes James what said like what adjustments would you be making to the early opener late caller strategy if you have three villains in the pot with you same as before except you're gonna be even tighter with these trash hands you're getting a really good price just now you're calling probably with all the suited cards and you want to play hands I can make straights and flushes basically what does the recommended strategy against the small blind is similar the range or defending against the button it's kind of its own topic but no it's not similar to the cut off a button if the small blind is making it two and a half X you should be calling like playing like 90% of hands 80% of hands you can call very very wide and it's a big difference because you're in position not out of position my next webinar no no sorry the later next month I'll have a webinar on small blind play and blind verse blind playing tournaments and we'll talk a little bit about that but in general your meeting of calling very very wide against the small blind when you're in the big blind there's most of this apply to online plane yes it applies both to live and online David Schultz post-flop hash I decide whether to check raise or donc weed on the flop when my opponent see bets post flop is just a whole nother game playing out of position but in general from the big blind you can pretty much check a hundred percent of flops and never lead on the flop you know blindly check from the big blind and you're gonna be doing just fine and then you just have a check raise and a check call and check fold strategies so you don't really need to be doing any dunk leading on the flop there could be a whole nother decision on that but that's the easiest way to play is just pure checking louis-philippe same III bet Bluff a hand like east 9c universal a position raiser and color and both call we make top pair with the ace where do we stand yeah so now you have a you know you probably only have a stack to pot ratio of like three to four with ace nine suited so you can start C betting very very very small like a quarter of the pot twenty percent of the pot you can kind of mix with ace nine suited checking because it'll be one of the worst hands it depends on the different a sight board to play completely different and post flop is a whole other time and strategy but in general you can start putting out like really small 15 to 20 percent continuation bets and you're gonna be doing very fine on those ace high boards thank you David Gonzalez for the compliment I appreciate Chris Chuck boys does the big blind ante have any effect on this no it does not but what does have an effect is the size of the ante so if you're playing like if you're still playing with like a standard ante there's some levels where the ante is bigger than one big line or there's some of those where it's less than one big line or some tournaments the big blind gets reduced to half of a big blind when you're short-handed so the size of the big blind the size of the ante is definitely going to make a issue or make a problem not the big blind ante itself yes Kim Lorraine what about the same situations were is good and bad players how does that affect you range like I said the beginning these are kind of base ranges against good players I'd start folding some of the marginal stuff against bad players I would actually defend wider than these suggested ranges these suggested ranges are you know against like good players and these are like the tightest you should ever go and you can always go looser against weaker players that aren't going to put you in tough spots post flop so Christopher O'Neill when playing with a lot of amateurs who tend to open from three to three and a half X from all positions do you recommend to tighten up or three let more if three of anymore what sizing would you recommend for thirty to fifty big lines deep so the larger the open when they're making it three and a half X you're gonna flat call a little bit less because you're getting a better price and you're a three bet more and the reason is is because there's more money be one post flop now by three betting and taking down the pot then just flat calling and seeing a flop master I would start three betting a higher percentage of hands against these three and a half X opens and you know thirty to fifty big blinds deep you know 50 big ones deep but if they're opening two three and a half X maybe I don't I'd three bet to like 12 X 13 X you don't have to make it as big because they already made it big for you would you increase this rebate frequency in online tournaments increase the ranges a little bit no these the ranges are all based on what ranges your opponent play so it's a matter of if it's they're looser or if they're tighter so you have to make you make the adjustments based off they're looser or tighter not whether it's online or live Miguel do you adjust for how deep you are in a tournament I see em if you get to like the final table or final two tables of a tournament I see em will definitely affect these ranges so if you're at like the final table or final two tables and you're facing arrays and the big blind these a lot of the like cusp II hands like seven six off-street five six off suit all these the fringe hands are gonna be clear folds now because you're not playing for chips you're playing for money and I see em that's a whole nother discussion but you're gonna be wanting to play tighter when I see em is a factor like on the bubble of a tournament you know if you're on the bubble you don't want to be defending you know six deuce suited when you're one of the short stacks on the bubble because you're trying to cash and we're at the final table because there's pay jumps etc Gregg s do you have any advice for keeping track of the chip stacks at a live tournament yeah like every like ten minutes or so or I do it like every time the button hits the one seat maybe I'll do it I'll go around and just keep note of how many big blinds everyone has at the table I'll make a mental note so I don't have to ask every time I just kind of know I also don't keep track of it in terms of how many chips they have I keep track of it in my head in terms of how many big blinds they have Shawn Tracy what happens to your three betting ranges the number of people calling the original racer increases past one caller you can start squeezing a little bit wider as the more colors are in you're gonna increase your squeezing range because there's more money to be taken down preflop so you're incentivized to play aggressive and take those pots down preflop so the more colors the wider you can squeeze math you say that generally defend with any two cards versus small blind raise against a small raise yes some players raise way too tight against the the small raises and so yeah your defense you're gonna be doing just fine probably defending any two cards it's better than the opposite in the multi way case with your defense range be substantially wider if the one collar were on the small blind rather than the button not substantially wider but it would definitely would be wider because you're now you're only out of position gets one player and you have relative position so relative position is important so assuming the small blind checks and you check every time and then the in position player bets you get to see what the small blind up does every time before you have to act so that's why another reason why you can defend very wide and just being in position on the small blind helps you a little bit but I wouldn't defend incredibly wide especially because of small is normally a very tight confined flattering range how does the skill level of villains interact with these ranges against weaker opponents I will defend wider than these ranges I'll never go tighter yes David I will be at Choctaw in May Kevin said yes they you had these Rangers reversed with a single razor versus multiple everyone does it's one of the bigger mistakes you see you need to be tighter multi-way and looser heads up well James said like asked what would you defend the big blind with versus an open Jam only the green ones no so that's a completely different topic you know calling versus ten big blind opens so yeah that's a completely different topic there's calculators out there to show you had a perfectly defend against you know shoving ranges what the handset call with so you can kind of work with those and do the work on your own but they know you don't want to be calling with the the green ones Darren Jackson asks what adjustments to six max obviously we want to widen up but there's it's just now that you're early position openers gonna be you know middle position so there's to me wider ranges so you're gonna defending a lot more and you're squeezing ranges are just gonna come up much more often because you're gonna be facing late position opens and late position collars more so it's just the frequencies are higher just because it's always a late position open any other questions before we wrap this up this webinar should be on YouTube the slides are not public but the the webinar will be on YouTube as far as I know all right there's no other questions we're gonna go and wrap this up thanks everyone for coming to our webinar scheduled for next month I believe it's April 9th and April 24th but I need to double check those dates again but two'd webinar schedule I believe they are on the first one is on polar versus polar and linear 3-betting ranges and the second one is on blind burst blind play so more of this blind brush you know playing out with a small blind big blind so thanks guys again hope you appreciate it keep working hard if you haven't yet signed up you know pokum think about the investment at poker coaching calm like I said I think you're gonna earn back that investment very very quickly put the effort in put the work in and good luck at the tables everyone", metadata={'source': 'MhSzBMvtKmw', 'title': 'Big

[Document(page_content="we had a bunch of hams that you played at the World Series feature table that year so let's go through a few and this person was pretty interesting so do you want to just talk us to it sure so and that opens under the gun and I defend Queen five suited for a 2x very standard you want to pause for a second or not mm-hmm cool I'm just gonna say what's a little bit interesting if we talk about the evolution of the game and you know what I was saying about if you're 510 pro 3 years later you might be a two-five Pro if you don't work on your game well at the time bizarrely as it might seem today I took a little bit of flack for defending Queen five suited for two times the big blind their error was like an analysis after the hand where Phil Laak and Antonio Esfandiari would break down he and and they pretty much started off by saying you don't need to defend Queen five suited here which pretty much everyone today would know is ridiculous and I've always been an aggressive player but I didn't think this was a light call at all it's a losing call but the 20,000 that I'm putting in the middle is making money but this is just a superior play to folding regardless of fact that apparently I'm dominated here yeah I definitely agree that in the past a lot of people fold here and I pulled it here a lot a while back and it's clearly a mistake because getting amazing pot odds and you're gonna realize your equity well enough I mean not too well but well enough to justify putting in another 20k yeah perfect was said so you host a call and if you are folding here by the way you are probably playing way too tightly if this is Queen pipe off suit you could justify holding it against under the gun raise agreed dude you just can't fold Sudan's so you get a good flop you checked the flop you're probably gonna be checking here with basically everything right yeah she looks like she's been just under half pot there and pretty standard check all the only thing I would say here is her see but I don't really like don't pause one sec mmm-hmm sorry I'm still I was trying to unfortunately WSOP back then they wouldn't list stacks at all times and that's like very important when you're thinking about this sea bet there's a big difference if you have something like 30 big lions versus a hundred big lines at 30 big ones for instance let's say Annette had pocket kings if I out flop her so be it she's screwed that's it she can't get away for KITT from Kings with 30 big blinds but if she has 80 or 100 big blinds it would be pretty disastrous to lose it all in a situation like this with a hand like pocket kings and dipping her toe in the water here is a little bit dangerous on six five to rainbow because yeah she can have pocket sixes she can have pocket fives but beyond that a lot of her range misses and I'm the only one who can have three four I'm the only one who can have five six I'm the only one who can have five two suited six two suited potentially it's it's a pretty dangerous flop for her so in her hand in particular well it has a little bit of backdoor potential with the spades I just don't see her folding many better hands on the flop maybe ace 9ac really and she's just not gonna proceed very well but mostly I would be worried that she's going to get check raised off the best hand pretty frequently when I have hands like seven four suited seven nine suited maybe even eight nine suited it's pretty touchy I would check back and I would check back with a lot of my ranges in that in this spot so you're essentially checking back flop looking to call a lot of turns with a lot of the range and then call appropriately on the river depending on how much you bet absolutely with the range with her actual hand she's gonna actually she would take in my book pretty weak line where she's gonna check back and unfortunately a lot of the turns she's gonna have to fold to my lead you know the sack size is in this example roughly in terms of big blinds that's what I'm looking at it looks like a net Scott for those green sexes or 500 K each so I mean she's probably around 2.4 million over a hundred big blinds to start the hand so we're pretty deep yeah Joseph says can she have an over pair she can't have an over pair Joseph but is she best let's say pocket nines and gets check raised it's awful because what's gonna happen is Jonathan's gonna bet the turn and the river sometimes especially when he has the nuts and those hands are in a miserable scenario they probably need to end up bowling especially in a tournament like the main event unless of course she thinks that Jonathan Jaffe is a lunatic did she think John Happy's a lunatic probably I her boyfriend at the time I think they're married he's actually a heads up sit and go player I don't want to get his name wrong um it could be a different but he was a good heads-up setting go player and she actually had told me at the table that he had warned her about me so for what do you think it's all that bad for something she didn't tell you that do you think it's all that bad if she'd have pocket kings just not fold to someone who is perhaps a little bit overly aggressive so you do check-raise no I just calls you down yeah if she has if you have her yeah burr agreed I think if she has that information she's just gotta gotta go with it particularly if she thinks that I don't know or I don't know that she has much info on me all right well let's keep moving through this and everyone in the chat asking for a million hypothetical situations now we're gonna go through this hand alright so you check call by middle pair clearly I say clearly it is pretty a pretty clear check call because you have a very clear marginal maid hand it could be that a lot of the time you don't want to raise sleeping in rows and get called you're in bad shape or who knows what you're Jack spades all right you're gonna be checking this turn pretty much every time I presume yep not many leads here with really anything alright so you check and she has a flush draw now yep - over sand a flush she definitely should be betting and she should be betting here because most of your range is marginal made hands at this point or perhaps like ace high and a lot of that will fold to a turn + riverbed right um I don't know that I agree with that so I think a lot of what I have is going to be a pair and a draw like I'll have a lot of gutters going along with my one pair but I do think hands like I have ought to be folding which I did not but I don't think I have too many a sighs my a sigh at this point mmm it's really like potentially a Stan but really I think ace queen and Ace King I don't you know at ace for ace 3 they're in there they might find a Czech Reyes year she's gonna get a lot of folds but mainly she wants to push her equity I didn't check raised her on the flop so it's very unlikely on a jack which really misses my range that she's gonna get check raised the folds that she does get which I'm gonna guess a normal player might fold like 30 40 % of their range at this point they're gonna help her a lot and then she still has outs first basically everything yeah what I was saying is with the King Queen of Spades if she bets the turn and you do call with 6 4 and then she checks the river and you check the river and she bets again you're probably gonna fold out then right yeah I just don't love her hand for a three barrel I think when she's blocking a high flush draw she's blocking some of the Auto folds that she would get out of me the king-high flush draw is definitely more bluffing on the river than an ace I flush draw but I don't think she has a great three barrel hand if she misses I think this is a good spot to shoot pretty big and then check back river once she should what what if we're flush draw lism a week or like 10 9 of Spades then I love it as a three barrel okay and and it's that's essentially just because there's more hands you can make fold that exactly and folds from just about everything are profiting your you know the ten nine of Spades you know is definitely not good on the river and now you can fold hands like you know Jeff he could have a hand like in Queen of Spades or ace Queen of Spades Ace King of Spades alright so pots 227 let's see what she does she makes it 135 she probably prefer a bit back bit bigger here right yeah I like maybe 180 yep so now like you said this is a hand that's pretty rough yeah especially given the Jack should hit her range way better than yours but you decide to call so does any particular reason why I decided to call beyond beyond you just an you have a pair correct yeah I think this is uh I kind of equate a lot of bad decisions that we make in poker with getting tunnel vision you Zone in on a factor let's say very simply that I said well Annette is an aggressive player okay but those are words like you want to quantify that does she have Bluffs absolutely and in my head you know I can't really recite the thoughts of that day but I would guess that I rationalized it was something like oh she's probably opening a bunch of extra hands under the gun well that's fine but I still need to really you know go through what those hands are what their equity looks like first me like let's say that she has something like she's opening seven nine suited under the gun I don't think that's inconceivable but okay she's got plenty of equity with pretty much all these hands the only hands that I'm like doing really really well against are like something like ace four hearts you know these these minimal gutters that only have one over to my five and the most important thing about why you're not the most important but a big factor unfolding here is that second speed really eliminates my improvement cards now the Queen of Spades and five of spades are certainly good overall for my hand but they're not going to be nearly as powerful as they would have been on a no flush drop board so two of my potential outs have been cut down as well I think this needs to just fold yeah I mean another tough spot around this is if she is opening wider with offsuit hands wherever reason it's gonna be a lot of them with a jack like Queen Jack and Jack ten that they would perhaps was normally bold but but yeah I completely agree with that but I mean look I tend to call a lot myself because when you're calling you don't have to be right all that often but yeah this is certainly not a great spot for you at all but it's like it's can't be that bad because you do still be some stuff the problem is he grabbed a tough time on the river if she just keeps betting right yeah agreed it's like if this was just all in here you could probably just call it off but we're not all in and we're nowhere near all in and that means you're gonna end up folding out incorrectly sometimes maybe paying off incorrectly sometimes incorrectly meaning you against her specific hand yeah all right rivers never gonna be you see with the Sam right alright so you call you know if you bet bigger here would you be more inclined to fold on the turn like say she did about 180 and say 130 it's tough to go back to that day as price six years ago but I'm guessing no I think I just wanted to be a hero that's my you know you can't be a hero if you hold the worst hand or the best and that's for sure exactly definitely not alright rivers and eights so this probably connects with you way better than it connected with her that said he'd still track and now you know it's kind of interesting cuz when she bets small on the turn I think she does need to be more inclined to bluff the river but if she bet bigger on the turn she needs to be less inclined to bluff the river agree with it and so she should go dig go small now she kind of has to go big she goes to 60 into seven fifty seven so third pots not only thats the pot after I think I think she bet half caught okay yeah she's about half pot okay yeah the one time they they update the sax immediately alright so yeah half I'm fine alright so what are you thinking at this point yeah so I definitely didn't love the river initially my thinking is that unfortunately a few of her Bluffs actually connected and made a pair at this point this is before she bets anyways I'm thinking [\xa0__\xa0] some of those like light opens that I was hoping could rationalize a turn call or like eight nine suited eight seven suited maybe seven nine suited and then not a light open but another hand that could connect is a say two spades and so this river kind of makes it where I'm like what Bluffs does she have left it's really just Broadway spades and maybe like a wheel a sly case for ace three there's just not too much that I could put together but I actually be that being said when she goes ahead and bets eight seven and eight nine or off the table that's too thin eval you bet at this point she's really representing a jacker better that's how I view this situation and then I kind of weigh that against what are the bluffs well they're pretty minimal it's those Broadway spades like King kind of spades can Queen of Spades a son of spades whatever and then a few other a sex of spades and then if I really want to say extra Bluffs maybe something like ace for our hearts ace three arts and really extra Bluffs would just be like a dry ace queen ace king these would be pretty terrible lines so I think that I'm beat a good chunk of the time which in fact I'm not but I'm trying to tell myself a way to win the pot because I'm at the feature table I'm an aggressive player and I probably way over estimated at the time how unwilling people are even very good players to make hero calls for large portions of their stack sometimes you know logic just got overwritten by you know the idea that people won't make certain calls and I think that's where I fell into in this spot where I'm saying hey you know what most of the top of her range looks like over pairs and you know she has a big jack sometimes I think she'll fold them a lot I totally incredible for having a set let's go for it a set and also perhaps 7/4 is an obvious one you could have yeah I like check raising 7/4 on this flop a lot because again it really hit my range and it doesn't check all the turn well what's up in four of spades I think is plausible doesn't say one don't say one thing you say about this though I wonder if people will make that much of a presumption about your range you know what I mean like I know that you'll probably check raising most of the obvious draws on the flop but do you think your opponent's just assumed that must be the case especially when you do now check raise the river no you're right and especially in this I think this 2013 there was a lot less check raising here a lot less range manipulation that's why while I was critical of Annette's bet I don't think it was remotely abnormal for the time and people in the big blind there were way under check raising so I think you make a good point yeah I mean I think as people get better and better they will realize all right seven four does check raises a swap all day but especially if you're playing in a weaker player pool there's gonna look at this board and say well if they had three four they already had me if they had seven four that got there they had nine seven of spades somehow they got there all right I guess I have to fold and I mean that's not gonna like I would not try this against the best players in the world today but it's certainly certainly something you can do especially if your opponents are generally value betting a little bit too thin but then folding to any raise yeah yeah agreed", metadata={'source': '4ZnheJQ5Bcc', 'title': 'The King of Exploitative Poker - Giant Bluffs with Jonathan Iftarii Jaffe, WPT Champ', 'description':

[Document(page_content="one of the most common things I hear from players is that shortstack poker is just bingo and that is absolutely not true I actually made a class discussing this exact concept for my members of poker coaching premium discussing this so check it out question is can we discuss stack size adjustments when we are late in tournaments and the average stack is 10 to 15 big blinds okay kind of a weird scenario but it does come up since we are all dealing with small stacks how do we further adjust for this without it being a shove fest how would you recommend to play small top pairs well we'll get in there maybe again if you all can hear me please let me know I need someone to type something in and there goes let's discuss the actual question because it's not actually very clearly defined so are we in or out of position what is the board what are the ranges right you always want to be asking yourself in these scenarios what is the actual question what are we trying to figure out and this was like that this questions me almost read of someone like complaining about the fact that many small and medium stakes tournaments do end up being 10 to 20 big line poker at least for some of the players of the table who are shallow stacked and a lot of people want to cry since we're dealing with small sex how do we further just without being at a shove fast anyone someone says something like shout faster bingo a poker or whatever it makes me immediately think they are not very skilled at playing shallow sacks so the next question may be kind of think the same thing well how do we recommend playing small top pairs that doesn't matter how do we play our range a range is what matters this got me to thinking about um well we'll get here in a second essentially I don't think most people are aware of what game theory optimal shallow stacked ranges look like so I've been spending today making them for all of you isn't they're not available yet but they will be available in the very near future they'll be included on poker coaching somewhere so look for those so let's talk about the various scenarios out of position as the caller position as the caller at a position as a razor in position is the razor right because there are many spots and all that really does define how you're going to be playing these scenarios so in general you should play a has discussed in the poker coaching homework you've done plenty of those all of that logic still applies except for you tend to want to have a little bit fewer drawers when you are talking about putting your whole stack and and very often you will be putting a whole stack in post flop so from out of position as the preflop caller when is that that is when someone raises preflop you call from one of the blinds you should be checking almost every time looking to check raise all-in with most strong made hands and draws on coordinated boards and check call or check very small with most strong made hands and draws on uncoordinated boards so let's take a look at this very common scenario out of position with 15 big blinds okay cutoff men raises we call from the big blind so you see the hands here in white are not in our range the obviously good ones all these good ones all these hands all these pairs we shoved preflop okay these hands at the bottom we folded preflop so that means we're flatting from the big blind versus they cut off raise with all of this take a look you see in this scenario we're actually flatting a pretty good amount right we're flatting well really all these hands and I know I do make it clear this is like a simplified gto strategy if you look at the actual GTO strategy it's gonna have you flatting with like King six suited sometimes jamming it sometimes fly-in King five shooters sometimes jamming it sometimes but these ratios of shove call fold still hold true and those are the charts gonna be making you all are simplified or i'ma call it implementable game theory optimal strategies Jim says wait we're defending eight two suited preflop yes every suited hand is a call preflop besides these few up here which you're shoving and that's because we're facing a min raise cut off min raises from 15 big blinds we are in the big blind this is the GTO strategy now if you're on a bubble or something like that maybe you need to play a little bit tighter if you can make your opponent risk their whole stack on the bubble maybe you need to play a bit looser kind of article a bit looser maybe need to be playing more aggressively post-flop anyway you do need to be call them in every suit at hand every suit hand is good enough facing in men raised because think about the odds right you're putting in one big blind to try to win your opponent's men raise your call plus the panty plus the small line so five point five big blinds is in the pot you have to put in one so you to realize like 18% equity from out of position and you're probably gonna realize 23 percent equity on average with sync with 8 2 suited because let me Nate to students obviously behind your opponent but it's probably have 35 person equity and you're gonna realize no 60 something percent of it 70 percent of it something like that often more because a lot of people aren't aggressive enough with their junky stuff so yes you're gonna under realize your equity but still you only need to realize 18 percent you're gonna realize more than 18 percent this is where a lot of the best players make their edge because they are willing to fight in the blinds and most people are not willing to fight in the blinds all right cut off men raises we call big blind flop comes jack seven five we check everything and if the opponent bets we are going to use this strategy so let's take a look we are check raising in this scenario with our strong made hands which is gonna be basically our pears pears are good enough here and we're also check raising with lots of drawers the drawers being gut shots so that's typically what we're gonna be doing in this scenario our sizing depends a lot on what our opponent does for our opponent bets like one big blind we're gonna want to have a smaller race size and all in our opponent bets like four big blinds or three big blinds then we're probably just going to want to be shoving because if we check raised versus a three big blind raised we where you have eight big blinds in the pot right so we are almost all in but this is gonna be pretty decent if you take a look at this the only kind of junky drawers we have are they've got shots which is gonna be nine six suited right nine six suit is the junky got shot into these guys shots are kind of junky but even then they still have plenty of equity because most the time your home is not gonna have top pair and if your opponent does have top here well that's a little bit unlucky so you should have a lot of fold equity in the spot our calling range take a look at that notice our calling range is all pretty good we do have some slow plays top pairs aces kings is worth mentioned we're flatting aces and Kings preflop or not jamming them and this looks pretty solid to me we are check calling stuff like King high sometimes on the flop which is a little bit dicey you may want to just fold those it is fine to under defend in these spots because of our excellent preflop pot off so if you tell me you want to fold out a little bit more of these hands on the flop like King six like King nine stuff like Queen ten King nine it's probably okay to fold those obviously the name we're tonight we're folding all of them because these these have plush drawers right so this is a spot where we can defend pretty much like this there's not a whole lot any opponent can do about it you may notice here we're also opting to call with some pairs some of the fives we're calling some fives and we're also calling with some jacks and some aces and that's going to protect our range and we're usually not looking to fold well top here clearly not but like we do have a five often we're ended up turning some draw for opponent puts us in we just can't fold that's really something you're gonna find very often is that you're just not folding if you make anything when you have 15 big blinds sorry your gum broke and that's okay so we're getting something like this and I think this is pretty reasonable obviously you could adjust a little bit but I think it's fine you may ask why we're like folding perhaps a six off suit but not King nine because King nine has a little bit more equity market says so we're check calling queen nine at diamonds here again depends on the opponent size right look at the hands that are on the cusp take a look at the cusps pans right queen nine clearly a cusp and King nine clearly a cusp and King eight clearly a cusp and so these hands as your opponent bets bigger you should start folding as your opponent bets small you should start calling so if you check and your opponent bets one and a half big blinds into the five point five big one pot yeah you should be calling with a lot of these hands I mean you don't love it but you should and it's nice because you're kind of protected because you have a decent amount of strong hands to check call with you may want to strengthen your check calling range even more like I have no problem check calling seven five suited jack ten jack nine if you think your phone is gonna continue barreling but very often what people do is they raise preflop the continuation about 1 times and they check down and notice a lot of hands that call once and then check down in the scenario do well enough I mean I'm not saying they're the best things ever but when you check call it like ace 9 and it checks down you you often win so that's what I would be doing in this scenario all right in position as the caller this is when someone raises you call on the button let's say so in this scenario when facing a bet which you often will you should raise all-in with strong made hands and draws on coordinated boards and call with strong made hands and draws on uncoordinated boards if your arrange is especially strong as it often will be in the spot you should consider trapping with much or all of your range by calling so what I mean by that is well cut off men raises you call on the button take a look at this range this is the button flatting range remember put yourself in this scenario how often does the button raise and you flap but men raise it I'm sorry cut off men raises you flat on the button I don't think many people are flatting like this with these hands but you should be notice here it should be very clear the hands that are not selected like all these a sex suit it's King age suited nine eight suited pocket sevens small pairs Kings Ace King all these hands are getting shoved preflop so obviously we have a very big showing range here but with a three point six percent of hands roughly maybe a little bit more because of the board but anyway with some percentage of the hands we should be flatting even with 15 big blinds and you know if you wanted to try to play a really simplified strategy in the spot you could just shove all in over a preflop raise with everything but you're probably a little bit of money on the table because you can't play some of these hands on the cusp as profitably so anyway say we do use this strategy Bob comes Jack seven five the opponent bets we need to do this let's just break down the range buy premade hand draw marginal mate and junk you see premium made top pairs are all great marginal made pocket sixes I mean pocket sixes is pretty decent here a seven is pretty good here don't know why only spades has selected that was probably a mistake on my part marginal made our well a seven selected marginal mate but it should be all a seven to marginal made clearly drawers or these hands and the junk are just the almost haven't selected right not sure why it's showing up like this anyway the junk is a sigh King high Queen high no flush draw and even then like with a club it's not total junk right so we really don't have much junk at all on this exact board now this would change a little bit if the boards instead let's say ten seventy five because those on 1075 we have fewer tens right notice here we have King Jack Queen Jack and Jack nine which line up just perfectly with a swap whereas if it's ten something something ten seven nine we have now have King Jack and Queen Jack that are junk as well or kind of marginal hands so it would change significantly so it's important to understand what your range actually looks like but in this scenario our range is so strong that we should probably just call it everything because like think about the range right when we have whenever we have King high we don't really want to be raising or jamming it all in like right yeah it depends on your opponent's best size to if your phone about one and a half big blinds you probably should call with almost everything maybe actual everything besides a six I guess a six you can fold but as you see this board lines up pretty well of your range because we were playing a fundamentally sound preflop strategy and again you can go through and use these preflop ranges and figure out how your range interacts on various boards like I'd have said 1075 s gonna be a decent amount different notes it was Queen seventy-five that's still pretty good right king seventy-five that's still pretty good really you just want the presence of one big card because one big card is pretty nice alright in position as the preflop raisers this is where we raise preflop the opponent calls so in this scenario we bet when you wanna bet using a 50% pot bet size or so with most strong made hands and draws on coordinated boards event using a 30% pot size with almost your entire range on uncoordinated boards if you all had time to go through the cash game master class the flop section we discuss this thoroughly whenever the board is coordinated you're usually not gonna have such a range or not advantage they want to be betting less for but using a big-sized when the board is uncoordinated you usually have the range advantage which allows you to bet everything kind of small so let's see how it lines up here you men raise cut off we're double underline I want it what's that from that's there for all right human race cut off and big blind calls what is your preflop raising range again looks a little bit funny right that's because we are men raising all these hands and we're jamming the other stuff King Jack offsuit eights Jack offsuit ace three offsuit ace two suited pairs Jack nine suited King nine suited right we're jamming those hands preflop for 15 big blinds from the cutoff now we're men raising these hands so here's what we're doing take a look notice range is pretty good in this scenario since we are doing the continuation betting is like we're check raising all-in or anything like that we can have more draws in our range but this this range actually works out just pretty nicely if you just break it down naturally because it's you know one to one ratio which we can even have a few more draws if you want it and then this two to one checking range you may opt to strengthen your checking range a little bit like I don't think it'd be insane to check aces and again these post flop solutions are not they've not been run through a solver but I can tell you it's gonna be pretty close to this and that's just because that's how these things normally get broken down and you have to ask so I want to try to memorize a chart I don't want to know how to make the chart myself and yes we're gonna be a tiny bit off game theory optimal doing it this way where we're just breaking our hand range now and very obviously because I bet if you drain this to a solver it probably tell you to check the aces some portion of the time and the King some portion of the time and you know that's that's slightly different what we have here but we are humans we need to make our lives as easy as we possibly can and this is this is very nice given this range is so strong because notice this one-to-one ratio makes our range pretty good and notice all these hands in red are like really good like these are not none of these are bad this even has this checking stuff like jacket every once in a while so given all these hands are pretty good we may want to just that small of everything even though this board is not incredibly uncoordinated or anything like but this is a pretty good spot so let's talk about out of position as the preflop raiser this is when we raise and then late position calls so here we want to bet using 50% pot size with most strongman hands and draws on coordinated boards opting to check raise all in some portion of the time usually when you don't mind protection you want about 30% pot with almost your entire range on the uncoordinated boards opting to check raise all in some portion of the time which is kind of difficult to show on our range analyzer chart but like right here notice the range breaks down exactly the same because we have our same range it is a little bit different here though I do want to make it clear you want to check here more often now due to being out of position against a stronger range right so say we raise and the big line calls big blinds range is a bunch of garbage to some extent it's not all garbage with some garbage where is well I'll show it to you here's the big line range right clearly a lot of garbage whereas the button's range is this range which is much much stronger right so in this scenario we need to be doing more checking because if we bet everything your opponent can your opponent's range is pretty strong so we probably want to start by a check strengthening our checking range even more in this scenario because we are out of position against a stronger range so that's almost certainly gonna mean checking aces kings queens sometimes jacks sevens stuff like that and you know you could actually probably develop a check raising all-in range in this scenario if you feel like it I don't think that would be absurd especially if you think you're promised to be betting the flop very frequently when check to so I think that's probably reasonable jim says so there's a relationship here between range advantage and nut advantage coordination and uncoordinated you watch the flop and the next video in the cash game master class but how to consider all four of these hasn't quite sunk any comment on this yeah I mean pretty much first things first do we have a big range advantage if you do just bet everything next if we don't have the range advantage does our opponent have a big nut advantage if your phone has a big nut advantage you'd want to be doing a lot of checking if you don't if the range advantage you want to be doing a lot of checking if you if you have a lot of that's in your hands but your age is generally weak you want to be doing a lot of check raising which is gonna happen a lot when someone raises you call big wine and it comes like seven six six you have a lot of seven six is where's your phone it has almost none that's the smart we want to be doing a lot of checking because you don't have the range advantage but you have the nut advantage so you want to be check raising the reason by the way the big blind doesn't do lead doesn't lead essentially ever from a game theory altima point of view are very rarely from on the flop is because you almost never have the range advantage what you just don't write because you're defending all sorts of garbage the only time sometimes it lines up decently well is when like button will raise and big blind calls then maybe sometimes it just lines up perfectly usually when it's the middle cards but even then it's still not great it's gonna be doing a lot of checking in the check raises so anyway coordination coordination / uncoordinated of the board will impact a few things as the board is more coordinated usually the ranges start to line up a little bit more depending on on how it's coordinator right if like this middle cards now range advantage no one really has a range advantage most of time in that spot if it's all big cards then the preflop raiser has a huge range advantage and a huge net advantage as the board is more uncoordinated you're very often going to want to use a small bet size because your opponents unlikely to have anything and as the board is more coordinated you're often gonna want to use a bigger bet size so say you raised under the gun and then like LoJack see calls and it comes king queen Jack like right there but that flop lines up really well with both players range ranges but under the gun just has way more nut hands they have all the super nut hands whereas low jack or high Jack would ever want to set does not so that's the spot where under the gun to just be betting big with everything even though the board's coordinated they should still be betting very frequently because it connects with them so there's there's a lot of little pieces at work and Jim I'll tell you just practice it over and over and over again and it will become second nature eventually and look you're still not gonna get it right all the time but as you practice more and more it will start to make sense they'll says the top players who study and play GTO the actual percentage to the point that they are really for example checking X percent of the cases X percent at the time some I mean listen no one's doing it let me check this twenty-eight percent of the time it's more like I'm gonna check this 75% 50% 25% or zero percent and again I don't think it's that big of a deal unless you're playing against like the absolute best players in the world and and you're like really striving to be balanced but it's certainly not relevant for 99.9999% of poker players to worry about that kind of thing first things first just figure out how to play something like this and you're gonna be miles ahead of everybody you're playing against because they're just gonna be like betting everything right and like we see right here very clearly we need to be checking at least 45% of the time and actually the number is probably higher so which is why I said we need to be slow playing sometimes because we're out of position in the spot so that is very relevant let's see you'll take notes on this once the recordings ready it's not second nature to you but you can see becoming that way so Jim I know there is in the cash game master class there's a flop summary go watch the flop summary that's that's your notes on it let's see also have to consider blocker size of the pot bet size and etc center center a poker is hard yes poker is hard and that's good we want poker to be hard a poker was easy then well we wouldn't be playing it most likely we'll be playing a more difficult game but anyway as you see when we go over here go and go back and comment on the question the initial question can we discuss stack size adjustments the adjustment is to play well it's not an adjustment the adjustment is to play good fundamentally sound poker since we are dealing with small sacks how can we further adjust for this without the fear of being a shove fest and you have to realize whenever you open well let me let me just show you whenever you open this from the cutoff right it's pretty obvious which hands you're calling to shove with life's easy we open this this range we're gonna call with sevens and better we're gonna call a King Jack suited and better we're gonna call probably about ace nine suited and better we're gonna fold everything else and that's it easy right so that that's pretty much how you want to go about this notice that whenever you flat say cut off raises you flat button if small blind shoves our big blind shoves yeah you're folding a lot you're probably I supposed to call with sixes and fives and aces if I had to guess but obviously are protected because they have aces sometimes which is very important notice if you just didn't have aces here now I'd be very susceptible to getting jammed on but by playing the fundamentally sound strategy it becomes a little bit easier I'm actually kind of surprised Kings or maybe Ace King suited is not a flat here but yeah whatever so so a very very strong range right but anyway you always want to be asking how ranges interact on various boards and that will often often determine your bet size but anyway I want to make it clear it's not just say shove fest preflop I mean clearly here I don't know what percent your hands are playing it's probably a lot but some portion of time we should still be flatting and if you're not doing that you're leaving money on the table and you have to get better at playing post flop I think that's something else people are deathly afraid if they like flat with sixes what about when it comes jack seven five yeah well sometimes it gets dicey and you have to become comfortable with realizing you know when you're playing with 60% of the field left in a tournament 15 big line stacks like often will be the case in small stakes live tournaments or whenever you're playing online and you're like in the money but there no payout jumps for forever because there's a thousand people in the money well it's you're basically playing a cash game and that is that is what these charts are excellent for obviously changes as stacks start to vary or as the payout jumps are looming but this is a good starting point I mean you have to be very careful bind ly following charts because they don't apply in many scenarios but a lot of people just try to go all under fold a 15 big blinds if you do that you are lighting your money on fire I hope you enjoyed this

[Document(page_content="hello everyone I am Jonathan little and today we're gonna be going through some hands that one of my poker coaching students James played in a $600 buy-in tournament that I bought him into because he won backing through poker coaching comm each month we've been giving away a few seats to tournaments with by ends about 500 to a thousand dollars James was one of the backing winners and he decided to send in some of the hands that he played so I'm gonna take a look at them I have not looked through these hands at all so you're gonna get my real-time feedback as if I was playing the hands and it's kind of like you're gonna listen to me play some hands so let's get to two also if you are a poker coaching member and you want to get backing click the link below there should be information below on how you can submit your application to have me buy you into live poker tournaments I have full faith in my students and I want to get my money in action and give them a great experience at the same time so if you want me to buy you into poker tournaments check out the link below alright so let's take a look we are playing 200 big blinds deep at Foxwoods in a $600 tournament we have a limp under the gun I would make it 500 or 600 in this scenario I think if you raise much bigger than that you're gonna start to get just a whole lot of folds but at least in my experience playing 500 ish dollar buy in tournaments a lot of people will call a pop sized raise maybe even a tiny bit more but the very wide range so that making it about 600 days makes it 400 and I think if we were shallower stacked this would be ideal but given we are so deep stacked you just want to build a pot and you want to extract full value with an effective nut hand you get two collars and notice right here the pot can just be 600 chips bigger which would allow you to make a bigger flop continuation bet right alright flop comes 8 5 2 small blind leads for 600 well this is one of the spots where small blinds range could be all over the place it may be exactly sets it may be exactly draws it may be exactly marginal may have hands it may be some mix those but in general I think given that there are just way more drawers and way more marginal maid hands and there are sets and two pairs I think I like a raise to maybe two thousand about three times the opponent's bet to give him the opponent bet relatively large if you wanna bet like two hundred on the flop I greatest more like sixteen hundred but when he makes a reasonable bet I think raised to about two thousand pretty nice James goes fifteen hundred and I think that is just a little bit small because thinking about all right if you phone it has nine seven for a gutshot nine seven two clubs that's the hand that's going to be getting pretty much the right odds plus implied odds to call he has to put in nine hundred more into a pot that's going to go up to four thousand so right now he's immediately getting four to one pot on or three three to one pot odds so he really only needs to get another five or six thousand chips to go in the pot to break-even and whatever he makes the straight you probably can also we could just have a better draw like seven six or five or four three that's getting great odds and if he has a hand like ace eight king and queen a jacket that's gonna call two thousand as well right so I think in two thousand raise or six tracks more value so so far I think James has used two slightly too small of best sizes turn to jacket clubs which is a very nice card because only jacket gets they're really small blind checks so just keep betting I would bet something like twenty eight hundred three thousand just to extract value James does basically that which i think is nice it's called river is an ace now in small blind checks so James almost certainly had the best hand on the flop in the turn the question is can we extract value now well if the opponent has an eight will they call any bet and I think the answer is probably no unless we go really small like a thousand or two thousand but then we run the risk of getting check raised every once in a while perhaps all in by a busted draw which I don't think we want so I think this is a scenario where it's probably just ideal to check it back unless you think the opponents just an extreme calling sation be given we are early in the tournament I don't see why we would have that read so I like a check behind I think James does check and we justwhen be nice to note the opponent had but I guess we don't 100 100 still 400 call call call I would just fall jak3 offsuit this is a scenario where yes we're closing the action yes we're getting good odds the problem though is that like what are we looking for on the flop even it comes King Jack three we can't just blast our money in because we easily can be against a good draw or be against King Jack or kings or jacks or threes right so you have to be very cautious in the spot if we were against the min raise and to call in a call on a call and a call I would call but I think this is just the fold I don't think there's any merit in turning this end into a bluff either it's just pretty bad so I would have just I would have folded this hand right here if James made it I don't know four thousand I actually don't think that would be insane and it might be a very strong play but it's just not necessary I'd rather use something like Jack three suited as a bluff as opposed to just Jack three officer which is legitimately terrible so don't feel like you have to defend in these spots you're just not getting great odds again it goes against the men raise you're getting better odds but we're against four be blind raise so just fold jack three two I would definitely check if it goes that call I would fold if it goes bet raise I would fold if there's one bet probably gonna stick around facing bet call I would just fold it's very likely we have the best hand at the moment but there are a lot of bad turns and rivers any king queen ace is terrible also even hand like pocket eights could randomly get there with an eight when an eight comes and would keep putting money in so the over cards may or may not be bad but we can't continue on them and the lower cards appear good but they may not be right also we could just be beat by a jacket moment so I like a bowl James sticks around though turns it to which again may look like a nice card but now like a stew gets there right facing if 2k bad I would just fold again so I would have folded much earlier in this hand check check on the river and a great example right so this is exactly why I said I would just fold on the flop because yes we could be against the draw sometimes and that's fine but really what drawers are there ace five ace three five three suited and it's just so easy to be beat when someone is betting in to multiple players so I like to fold they're just on the flop well preflop first right those who are dominated preflop on the flop who are dominate fold it on the turn I would have fold it and then on the river I I would have folded do it that again so that's a good example why you just don't want to be playing the jak3 offsuit or even like Jack six off soon there Jack seven I'd probably check sevens even close jack and what a call preflop but have to be very careful big card little card is just not a good hand all right one hundred two hundred facing a raise call call call you need a three bet or a call I would probably just go ahead and three about this hand is a solid blocker bluff what you just want to make about a pop size raised in this scenario pop size raises three times the last bet the three times seven is twenty-one plus any additional money in the pot so 21 plus twenty three ish so that is forty three hundred or so I know that seems like a big bet a lot people they know forty three hundred that's huge burly is just a pot size bed so three times the last matter which will be twenty one hundred plus another twenty-one here plus call it three or four hundred from here depending on what the ante is we see a big blind andy of two hundred right so about forty three hundred or so James decides to call look I don't know problem with calling but I think in this scenario if you three bet and get jammed on you can easily fold even getting okay pot odds if you think you're getting close to having to call it off based on getting too good of pot odds you can make it a little bit less like thirty five hundred then if you face a 20k shop you can fold but I would have just I think I would have three about this preflop if this was suited I might be more inclined to flat call because it's just gonna flop better multi-way but top pair multi way is usually fine but certainly not it nut hand so you don't really care people hold preflop and if they do call you can you can proceed from there all right we flop gutshot I would just check I would not put any money in here facing a 1k small bet and a call and a call guess I'd call right now we have to put in a thousand to try to win nine thousand getting pretty great immediate odds we have the straight which is very live the straight draw which is very live back board diamonds may be fine the problem of the back board diamond like say terms of to add items is if we face a bet again we're not getting great odds and we're proud on get paid the river so I get we have backboard drivers diamonds but it's not quite as good as it may appear because we're a bit tough time getting paid when we get there but I would have called here turn to five I would just check Bowl analysis against another tiny bet where was a jack facing 5,500 bet I would just fold we're gonna be here a lot of the time it's very very easy to be against a draw that got there like 10 9 of diamonds ace 10 they decided to float like you did Jack 10 Queen 10 right all those hand or Jack 10 would bat Queens him probably but King would bat we beat Jack ten anyway what am I saying the two pairs what I'm trying to say here Queen Jack there we go Queen Jack King Jack those would bet so I like it bold here and that's a fine hand if you did three about that in preflop I'd probably make a small bet on the flop against one person and then then go from there and probably just end up checking down the turn in the river all right we were raised to 700 I typically use a big array size when we're playing very deep we are playing 66 issue big blinds deep so I think raising to about 800 900 is fine whatever seven unders fine doesn't like that big of a difference they've lined three bets I would just call against the loose aggressive player in position with the suti connector hands great opponent best the flop we have a pair in a draw I would call some people think they always need to rage with their pairs and draws but the problem is if you raise here what's going to fold well under pairs are gonna fold which in Krush maybe hands like ace king would fold which you don't really mind if ace king folds but that's it ace king king queen and ace queen would fold but besides that a lot of hands that would fold you demolish and also you kind of know which cards are bad for you right like an ace is obviously bad at King is obviously bad every other cards kind of okay I mean I get that a queen makes a stainless trade but such is life and the thing is no better hands fold right like a stent probably isn't gonna fold king 10 probably isn't gonna fold queen 10 probably as I'm gonna fold a Jack's not gonna fold over pears not gonna fold there's really no point in raising raising for the most part makes your opponent play well and we're against a lag if we just randomly out of three outs right like a specs terms of nine which he didn't really want pony bets 5k well I would call here and they look to fold the river I would also call here with a queen so my range gonna be decently well protected here it's gonna be something like two pair and better maybe something like King Jack and better maybe maybe King tenon better for a gutshot right I'd also call some some diamond drawers if I had them probably all have a ton of diamond draws less is like Jack X of diamonds or eight X of diamonds so I like a call here and then just fold to a river bath there was a nine that's nice opponent bets I would jam exponent checks I would jam I think your phone's can have a lot of queens and just a whole lot of garbage in if your phone has garbage he's gonna fold to any bet guys a queen he's going to call any bad presumably if you thought your opponent was just done with the hand like obviously done instead of shoving I would bet something like 2,000 to try to make it look like I'm trying to get some thin value back through or maybe some weird Bluff to potentially get the opponent to jam over the top of me but if the opponent looks like they are checking to try to induce a bluff well then clearly just want to jam and get all the money in so either I bet very tiny here to try to reduce a bluff or all n just if I expecting a call a lot so you do get called and you win which is great it's a well played hand if your opponent bet the river by the way on a non nine or ten I would have folded so be aware of that it's perfectly fine to call a turn bet when they do if you're gonna fold to the river bet as long as your range is well-protected you won't always ask yourself in that spot if I call a turn bet with this hand what other hands do I need to call with to make sure I'm just not folding everything to a river bet because imagine if you only call it two pair there on the turn or drawers and you fold all it through a river back you're really exploitable so make sure you call her your queens as well and when you do have a queen there don't just think what should I do in my queen and think how would I play the rest of my range assuming you're trying to play against your to play balanced strategy against reasonable opponents of course if you think your opponents are not very good and you can be well out of line maybe just make sense to jam with the Queen there to get full value from two pair that'll call it off although clearly that won't happen very often all right 1000 facing a 3300 raised from 40k stack and then an old man jams thousand three hundred so here what is old man mean right some players who are old men will have only the nuts here like nines are better an ace queen and better maybe King Queen some old men will have all sorts of stuff so here's a spot where you can either call or jam or fold depending on the scenario also what do we think about the initial raiser I see their rate labeled as a lag here so I would not expect them to have too many nut hands so I'm probably gonna play this hand if I expected under the gun to be tight I would strongly consider just open just folding so what you want to ask in this scenario if I call am I giving the initial raiser great odds to call and is that a problem and here it is a problem because your phone is going to be in position closing the action having to put in five thousand to win thirty thousand or something like that twenty five thousand so they're really not making a mistake by calling so for that reason we want to re-raise and then you want to ask if I rear a can I fold it to a jam or are there any hands of my ranges I would like to fold to a jam so if your areas here it's gonna be a 13 k if we min raise typically that is the size we're gonna want to use in these scenarios if that is what you want to do so if I make it 13 K can I fold for another 23 K and do a pop that's gonna be like 80,000 dancers just know right so if that reason if we are going to continue in this spot we even need to well we probably just need to shelf it was one in a mouse - because calling is not great memory raising is not great so shoving is probably the only option in this exact scenario given the stack sizes you always want to go through all of your options to see if any of them are particularly great particularly bad shoving to make the make the lag fold-out lower pairs which is great you can make the lag fold-out stuff like King Jack suited which is great because although Sam's got plenty of equity so James likes to call and I think this is not great because we just now let the lag call imposition and that's not so good if now it's also the lag jams what do we do now we're not quite getting the right on us a call but how do we make the lag to play I don't know lag does call as we see not great check opponent bets unfold and notice here if we jammed it would have gotten it all in flipping gotten to realize our equity now we end up what's probably gonna happen is if we get an ace or queen on the flop people on its gonna get off the hook and if we miss we end up losing the pot a lot so this is not such a great outcome for us right I mean I understand that we avoid the neck flip before all we know maybe the opponent holds pocket jacks brief let me think about all right put your opponent yourself in this guy's shoes it goes Ray's Jam all in for 50 big blinds you call it off with jacks I mean it's very close you certainly don't love it especially if James has been reasonable so anyway they get it all in we don't know how it ends up but it doesn't really matter all right race the 2.5 big blinds with Jack's which is fine get three bet by a kid I would just be all that every time this is a spot where the kid can be three betting a decent amount obviously the 8k free bets a little bit small but the opponent is somewhat shallow to begin with so they're three betting sizes should be smaller in general so I'm cool with just jamming here Jack's is great you can also call in position if you think the opponents really wide but if the even if the opponent's really why they're often gonna have stuff like king queen and a sex and just like stuff that has equity right and you don't really care if your opponent folds out of equity Plus Jax is gonna end up folding a little bit poorly post flop like say it does come King Queen blank in the opponent has a is five and they bet you just fold and your opponent gets the block through right anyway we call here's a great example I would just check check the flop I would check behind on the turn because if you bet the turn and the opponent calls or jams you're unhappy and if it just checks down you're gonna end up winning a lot maybe you're thinking you can make a hand like Kings fold but I'm not trying to buy people off Kings also the opponent could just be checking with a sax to try to induce the bluff realizing that if he bets and gets called he's pretty unhappy so I don't think you want to bet here because when your opponent Bowls are usually folding out pretty perfectly unless they have exactly kings or Queens Lehman kings or Queens may not fold to a 10 K back so here I think you have a pretty clear marginal made hand I get any betting so that you don't face a river bet but like I don't know what a kid means here if the kid might just jam you all in with some random junk like king queen thinking that you're making some thin protection bet or something like that then clearly this is awful to bet and then fold to a jam so I think I would just check and just check it down and be content with that in general when you have a marginal made hand that can win if it checks down you want to just be checking it down obviously you'd rather bet with like Jax I think then Kings here because Kings can Kings isn't so worried about getting out drawn on the river where Jax kind of is cuz the king or queen could be pretty bad but I don't like it really matters all those he has just want to check just checking it in the showdown you're gonna win a decent out of time and nobody's holding an ace right so when people fold here they're folding out usually unpaired hands that you crush and lone pairs like pocket 7s that isn't gonna put money in anyway so I think you'd rather just check alright 50 big blinds hasten or limp three big blind raise I'd probably just flap if you get rear ace here you can fold pretty awful flop for you should we bet as a bluff if they check to us this board should line up okay with your range should also line up with the weak passive players range is some extent though I think if you want to Bluff here the obvious draws make sense like Jack 10 Queen 10 Queen Jack foods if you have them if you have a random hand like a 7 suited a six suited Shore Bluff those so I don't know if it necessarily need to bluff the ace Jack if you don't hand like king queen of clubs I would Bluff that but I don't think ace Jack needs to block what if you did block I think it's acceptable turns of 10 check check again the same story do we need to bluff this the problem is on this board your opponent's if they're good they should be doing a decent amount of checking with their marginal mate hands looking to check call so I think if you bet to turn in this scenario you need to be willing to Bluff the river so again the question is do we have better hands we'd like to bluff here what king cleans an obvious one King Jack's an obvious one we had a seven or eight six i I have to think we would just bet the flop so maybe we don't have very many better Bluffs right I mean we don't have like Jack for preflop so maybe this is just the hand we want to use ace Jack King Jack and king queen is our Bluffs maybe also do you want to have any Bluffs if you're playing live poker in a six hundred dollar tournament you can often look and tell if your opponents are paying attention if there's going to stick around in this pot if they are going to stick around in this pot then don't Bluff and if they're one of the two players is clearly folding and the other ones attacking normally maybe you should go for it so we do it for an eight thousand bluff into the twenty four thousand pot so whenever you use a small size like this you definitely wanna make sure you're betting the river and you know given how I just kind of went through the range we don't really have any obvious Bluffs I generally like a small sizing you get called and like I said we need to be bluffing the river opponent checks river pots 40k we have a TK behind um from a GTO point of view we could just shove problem is is that every wants to while we're just gonna get snapped off by two pairs something like that or king.queen that decide to make a weird Czech call or King Jack yeah we're gonna be against a lot of marginal made hands here in general so the question is how much will your opponent call with a marginal mate hand and at what point do they start folding and I think a bet of like 30k is probably fine you definitely want to bet small like fifteen cases if you about 15k then random hands like a 10x or 9x we'll call you but I think a bed of 30 or maybe 35 K is pretty good maybe 35 K is ideal here check-check I do not like check check unless you can just tell your opponents never folding right like if your opponent looks pumped up whenever they get the King on the river then clearly don't Bluff but I think this is a spot where I you need to Bluff you have basically no showdown value and when you have no showdown value you need to Bluff notice here that if your turn Bluffs are literally king queen King Jack and Ace track they all got their on the river right so you get to bet the river with a lot of hands if you get Queen Jack you keep betting if you had to parry to keep betting so this really is one of the worst hands in your range at this point so whenever you have one of the worst hands near range and you have a blocker to the nuts right we block with Queen Jack I think it's a mandatory bet and giving your range is so incredibly strong that's why you don't need to go gigantic like all-in and to be fair if you're trying to be GTO in the spot the ideal plate could just be a small bet because like I said you have lots of nuts here anyway check check Bona is a set if you can look and tell the guys not folding obviously don't bet but this seems like a spot where just your hand in general really really really needs to bet all right pocket eights 38 big blinds you open it up which is fine and get three bet by calling station hmm alright so what does this calling station mean to James so if someone is a calling station that means typically when they show aggression when they three bet you usually have a really good hand so if they have a really good hand we definitely don't want jam right so the options are call or fold we don't to re-raise either because if we rearrange or probably gets a stronger than average range remember calling stations call too often that doesn't say anything about the rear azem strategy but if they usually call too often it means they don't rear a is often enough which means when they do rear a is they probably have a really good hand so we don't want to be raising so can we call and just try to get a set well we have to put in ten to try to win 35 so not great pot odds immediately can we get an additional we have to try to get in 10 to 1 implied odds right we need to be able to put in 10 here to win a total of 100 from the opponent and we're getting barely that so I actually don't mind folding here I mean you kind of hate to fold in here but I don't mean either colorful whatever what I'm saying is this close oh definitely not jam though definitely not rewrite yes ad which is great check your opponent bets I mean you love just get it in immediately and if the opponent does have a strong range I think you should just get it in immediately again if you can tell the opponent looks kind of unhappy here then definitely call if the opponent looks like yep I have aces definitely get it in so either either call or jam either plays fine you do jam and you list of Queens knows you see the opponent did have a very strong hand preflop and obviously once you get a sack or not folding which is why you want to make sure you have at least medium and big pairs because he it's always unfortunate when you get set over set it and clearly low pairs get set over setting more than medium pairs which get set over set in more than good pairs so tough run for James right at the end but in general it tips for James you need to use bigger sizings across the board I think in the early levels there were a few spots where you definitely used bets that were too small there were a few spots where I thought you also could have potentially bluffed but it turns out like the previous hand where you had the ace Jack on the river kind of mandatory bluffing hand it would have medically failed so maybe you had a good read to the point you didn't do that but on all these hands all seemed reasonable right there was nothing that was egregious and whenever there's nothing that's egregious that's that's solid means we we backed a good player poker coaching calm and again if you are Pope the coaching member check out the links below to apply for us to give you money to

[Document(page_content="especially in live cash games most of the time when you raise everyone else is either gonna call or fold right but there are going to be times where you raise and then you get three bets re raised the term three bet will be used throughout this masterclass as opposed to re-raise because re-raise is not necessarily clearly defined right because let's say there's a raise and re-raise and re-raise well now is that the the third bet or the fourth bet the way the term three men came around by the way is from Limit Hold'em where there'd be a small blind of big blind if you called wellyou've calling the first bet right the blind does the first bet so when you raise that's a theory of to bat and when you re raise that is a three bet so if free bet here means someone raises so let's say three big blinds an O or let's say we raise the three blinds or three and half P blinds and our opponent makes it 10 big blinds that is the third bet because the small blind was the first or the big blind was the first back the initial raise that you made was the second bet this is a third bet so whenever you get free bet very often sometimes you're gonna be again strong hands and sometimes they're gonna be against weak hands and we have to figure out how to defend right so if your opponent plays well you should tend to defend at the minimum defense frequency or more and again very often more because if you defend right at the minimum defense frequency your opponents probably going to prop it a little bit too much with their preflop Bluffs because a lot of their hands that they're bluffing with have plenty of equity so you probably need to defend a little bit more so let's take a look at a very clear example let's say you raise two three big blinds and your opponent three bets to ten big blinds right minimum defense frequency we discussed this before is one - the opponent's bet right divided by the opponent's bet plus the pot and the pot here is your three big wine raise plus the small blind plus the big blind so if you do this math it comes out to 31% which means you need to defend with at least 31 percent of your range now kind of go back to the example I gave where if you are defending the big blind you should be way over defending same thing when facing three bets because you're gonna have lots of equity with your range especially if you balanced it well by playing the ranges I recommend it so since your preflop hands will have lots of equity you need to defend wire Brad 60% of your opening range or more depending on the range you expect to be against from your opponent so let's take a look at how the natural lowjack are under the gun plus 1 versus LoJack strategy happens this is when under the gun plus one raises folds around to the player in the LoJack seat which is the middle position and they free them now under the gun plus 1 this is if you open from early position should for a bet for value with the absolute best hands aces kings and Ace King you should format as a bluff with some hands that are not quite good enough to call that's gonna be a check off suit case 9 suited ace five suited ace four suited King 10 suited and queen time suit you should then call with the hands the flop very well right these are the strong pairs best suited Broadway hands an ace queen and then you should fold the worst hands in your range and these are hands that are very often dominated or just aren't getting the right price to call and this is a pattern that you're gonna see very often against opponents who play well of re-raising your best hands calling your stuff that's good enough to call re raising the hands that are on the cusp of playability but not quite and then folding out the worst hands in your range so as you see it's easily gonna go red hands green hands blue hands and then grey hands what we'll see that as we continue going through a lot of the charts but the minimum defense frequency and the general strategies for this situation where you raise them someone re-raises make three bet is also in the charts so make sure you go when you look at the charts you may find that you feel uncomfortable calling some hands like sometimes as you get wider you'll be calling with some suited connectors will be calling with some smaller pairs may be calling with King Jack offsuit but in general these strategies are perfectly fine assuming your opponents play decently well one thing you may notice is that very often these big cards like a standoff suit King Jack offsuit and Queen Jack offsuit or used as Bluffs so when you do rear ace here with ace Jack offsuit for example you are bluffing and you're bluffing with ace jack because we have the ace in your hand and a jack in your hand it's now way more difficult for your opponent to have aces Ace King ace Queen and then also pocket jacks right so having that card in your hand makes it less likely that your opponent has a strong hand which means that assuming they have a bluffing range as all good players will they are more likely to have a bluffing hand which means our gonna fold to your format and when we do for doubt here but pot size re-raise would be three times last bet so it'd be 10 dollars or 10 10 big blinds times 3 so 30 plus any additional money in the pot which would be your initial raise so it's gonna end up being like 35 big blinds however as these stacks get shallower and shallower in relation to the best size you can typically make it a little bit less like in this scenario if we're playing a hundred big blinds deep you'll probably want to make it more like 28 big blinds if we're playing 300 big blinds deep though you probably want to be making it more like 35 big blinds so that's the student your opponent plays well right now what if they don't play well what if they play very tight and straightforward this is gonna be the case in a lot of small states live games okay you're gonna raise if they rear A's they have aces and kings and queens and Ace King well against that range what should you do well typically you're going to want to defend with hands that are getting the correct implied odds now the implied odds we discussed earlier with the small pairs essentially want to be making sure you can be getting paid 10 to 1 at least on your set draw so if you make it 3 B blinds and they make it 10 you have to put in 7 big blinds more right so if you can count on your opponent paying you off for your full 100 me blind stack and decent amount at the time because he doesn't know they have aces kings or queens you can call with your small pairs right but let's say they're a little bit more loose a little bit more aggressive you should be now a little bit more inclined to fold because they're not going to have a strong enough hand ax just mindlessly put their money in every single time so again some players who are a little more aggressive you need to be a little bit more inclined to fold which is kind of counterintuitive right with suited connectors and suited aces you typically want 20 to 1 implied odds which you'll almost never be getting unless you're very deep stacked so against very strong ranges the only hands you really should consider calling whether suited I'm sorry of small pairs and medium pairs of course and the absolute best big suited hands and then hands like aces kings queens and ace king aces and kings especially you're usually just best getting it off and getting it all in preflop Ace King and ace Queen against a tight player should very often call and then play as we're gonna describe in the post lop section now if your opponents maniacal understand the implied odds hands go down in value like the small pairs but stuff like king queen goes up in value because now if you make top pair you just know you're never folding against the maniac right so against a maniac you should be defending a larger portion of your range compared to if your opponent is tighter but like I said a different portion of the range right which is something that you need to make sure you're really focusing on because you want to make sure that your hand has very good post flop playability especially when you know we're going to face aggression and you really don't be sitting there with a really bad made hand that has little potential to improve like say you raise pocket twos and then a maniac tree raises and you call flop comes nine seven six if they bet I mean yeah the best hand a lot of the time but you're having a really difficult time on the turn in the river if you face additional aggression and you will against amania right so few more ideas usually you're late position raises will face more resistance okay so whenever you do raise you should expect to get re raised more often when you're raising from later positions because your opponents realize you're opening with a wider range right also don't consult fall into habit of bolding too often it's so easy especially when you move from small stakes the medium stakes live like from one to two to five or from two five two five ten to think the players are only raising with the best hand so if they're only three betting with the nuts you should be pulling a lot but as you play against tougher and tougher opponents they're gonna be using this polarized strategy that we are discussing and well you can't just fold all that often because that allows their Bluffs to immediately profit so do not fall too often against competent and especially overly aggressive players and you also want to consider your pot odds and post-flop playability for example if you make it three big blinds and your opponent makes it six big blinds well now you should continue with pretty much everything because II have to put in three big blinds to win at twelve big blind pot how hard is it to realize 25-person equity with a decently strong range right it's not so hard now of course if your opponent re-raises to six big blind resulting aces then that changes things again and if you raise to 3 B blinds and your opponent makes it 100 big blinds or 40 big blinds nice just folded time because getting very poor pots let's take a look at a few examples let's say you race with a LoJack to three big blinds with ace Jack offsuit and the button free bets to ten big blinds alright now if you vomit some maniac in this scenario you should pretty much always call or perhaps poor bet if you can be happy to get it all in for 100 big blinds or however deep applying with the ACE Jack offsuit usually not going to be the case though so against the maniac you should call every time because these jacks gonna flop strong top pairs which are pretty great and if he plays tightly if they're only be raising aces kings queens jacks tens nines Ace King ace Queen and ACE track when I should fold ace Jack because you're either flipping or in bad shape against your opponent's whole range we won't be referring to the odds that you win throughout this master class that is very important understand that you don't know what hand to your opponent's had right they have a range and you need to make sure that you are accounting for the fact that sometimes they have a system sometimes they have knives but if you average that out its jacks in pretty bad shape so with hands like sixes you should tend to call against both players if they will mindlessly stack off post-flop again sometimes the Maineiacs are the slightly more aggressive players won't write they're gonna utilize the idea of pot control where they have a decently strong but not enough hand and they're going to check and we're gonna be discussing that again in the post flop section with hands like nine eight suited you should tend to call against the loose player because if you make a pair or a flush draw or strange are you're pretty happy but for 100 big blinds deep you should fold against the tight players due to a lack of implied odds you always want to keep your implied odds in mind if you are getting poor odds to try to make your your strong hand if you call in the scenario has a lot of small stakes players do they call it a ninety eight student they just bleed off that seven additional big blinds very often when they do win they only went back like 30 big blinds so if they if they end up missing and they end up losing a ton of the time what happens is they lose seven lose seven loose them and loosen and lose seven to seven than win thirty and they repeat that over and over and they lost too many sevens to make up for the thirty that they win so always consider the implied odds also you should be more inclined to call from in position if you raise in the small blind big blind read raises be way more inclined to call than if you raise and say the button or the cutoff freezes because you have to play from out of position and being out of position is very very bad being in position is very very good so and this is often why we are discussing re-raise a little bit larger from out of position by the way because that will make it more difficult for the opponents to call because you've cut down on their implied odds and their media pots where it's when you're in position yeah you don't mind if the opponent falls but you also don't mind if they call because they're gonna be out of position and they're gonna face very very difficult situations but um it's a very very generic tip and small stakes games it's probably fine to fold a lot when you get re raised but as you play against better and better opponents you should be way more inclined to defend and get ready to battle post flop so here is the cache game and masterclass I spent a ton of time making this I've been putting it off for a while because I've been working on a new way to share that all this content new and a new way to format it and we have 29 lessons they explain to you everything you need to know

I go in depth on exactly when to continuation bet and how much right because if you think about it that's all you really have to do is to figure out how to win at poker right should I bet yes or no if so how much I need to do that right every single time you're just gonna demolish your opponents and that is what I teach you in the flop section and then I go through plenty of examples also we do the same for the turn to the river we go through many many hands using the analysis we use at poker coaching calm and the homework challenges well instead that you are loving the cash a masterclass you

[Document(page_content="it seems like most people are able to see the PowerPoint I'm not really the troubleshooter on the program here I'm not sure why maybe refreshing and trying to get back in on my end it shows that you should be able to see it and it looks like some other people are able to see it all that said we're gonna go ahead and get started little intro about 30 to 40 minutes today and we'll have love a lot of time for questions today good glad to hear Gary the refresh worked so today we're gonna look over for sure two hand histories from the world series and possibly three if we have time I have three hands prepared and we have a specific kind of goal in mind today with going through these hand histories I have some students people always asked me you know I played this hand what should I do in this spot and the main you know me coming up in poker as well the main when I had a problem or I didn't know what to do in a spot I would ask someone else or I would go on to you know two plus two forms and post the hands when that you used to be able to get constructive feedback there you know you used to be able to post a hand on twoplustwo and get responses from like Ike Haxton and Scott Seiver a bunch of good players they used to post on there all the time that's not really the case that much anymore and so the point I'm getting out now is yeah you can ask someone else and just take and copy their answer but how do you know if you they're right how do you not know if they're just saying whatever you need to learn how to figure things out on your own for a couple reasons one you're not going to learn anything from just copying a strategy from someone and we'll see that later today when we look at a hand and piosolver how I how I look at it how I'm trying to learn from it you need to learn about situations you need to learn about the adjustments you need to learn to understand the nuances and not just the entries and knowing the steps that got you to that end result and when you learn those steps that's gonna help you it takes a little longer to do but it's gonna help you so much more in the future when a slightly different spot comes up you're gonna be able to solve that spot in real time because you've done the work learn the steps and know how to solve that problem so in general when I'm playing you know and this is one of the biggest things with online poker online poker it's really easy and I actually wrote an article I'm not sure if it's been released yet on why you need to have online poker in order to be the best in the world and the number one reason is is it's so easy to review your play with online poker now whether you agree with the heads-up displays or not I don't care about that what I care about is you know how my hand history's downloaded so I can go through all my hands and learn from my hands and easily have them to review live poker it's a little different I carry around a little notebook with a pen johnathan little on his website has an article I believe that can we can post a link to it somewhere on how he records hands down I have my little format of how I record down hands and basically anytime that I have a hand I'm not sure about I jot it down in my notebook and I jot it down because I wanted out of my brain and a lot of times a lot of people they they're not sure about a hand or they think they made a mistake and they think about that hand for the next 20 30 40 minutes or the rest of the day and that's taken away power from brain power from thinking about new hands that come up so writing down these hands not only does it give you a chance to write down the details so you can review it later it also it also keeps it out of your gets it out of your brain so that you can move on and keep playing good poke or the rest of the day so today we're gonna look at these two maybe three hands depending on how it goes and we're gonna kind of go in depth so we know how should you go about reviewing your hands so first one is you want to have specific questions you want to have answered so basically like when I write down a hand I'll ask specific questions like I'll write down my hand and they'll be like should I ever raise the flop what isn't what Bluffs do I have on the river here how thin can I bet for value etc I'll have different questions that I want to ask and what I want answered when I'm reviewing a hand second important thing is to look at this situation broadly and not just what happened in the hand so you want to be looking at different situations so thank you Ken ken just posted the link let me copy this really quick one second here I'm gonna leave that and then I'll do it at the end of the webinar Ken thank you so there what I mean by this like adjusting the variables and look at the situations well let's say it how I look at the situations broadly what I mean like that is say you have a flop like Jack 10-5 and then the term was an 8 in the hand and you're not sure I'm not Shh I'm not sure what I should do on this turn card well you're gonna look at what you should do on that turn card but also what do you do when the ace comes on the turn or what do you do you know on different turn cards and we're gonna look and show you how I do that and then adjusting the variables this is really important in like push fold spots which we're gonna look at one we're gonna adjust stack sizes we're gonna adjust the ranges and we're gonna show you how I go through like a pushin full spot how I make my assumptions based on ranges and find out what hands are profitable calls and which hands are not so today we're gonna be using two main tools to help review hands we're going to be using Hold'em resources calculator this is a paid program that I think is pretty essential for being a tournament player I think it's a program either this or I see a miser they're both kind of both holding resources calculator which I will be saying as HRC it's kind of the acronym that's commonly used for it so the HRC and ICM Iser both kind of do the same thing it's just kind of a preference I prefer HRC that's just what I've used and then we're gonna use piyo solver piyo solver is obviously a very incredibly complicated program but I'm gonna when we go through a hand later I'm gonna show you kind of how I use it and how I use it to not just blatantly copy the strategy that it spits out for me to do I'm gonna look at how I effectively use power to learn about situations and learn what kind of my general strategy should be in spots so Nate to be honest I'm not really sure if you're supposed to see everyone else's comments I don't think you are but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to see everyone else's comments I have this link that can sent I'm trying to figure out how to copy/paste it but I will I will I'm trying to see I will copy that into the chat later so that you guys can all get that link for how Jonathan takes notes on hands but the meantime let's go through these first hand histories the first hand we're actually gonna skip ahead all right so the first hand that we are going to be looking at and I close the link good thing I did this copy all right so this is the first hand that we're gonna look at for today this is from the $1,000 no-limit hold'em double stack last week they had like 8,000 players or something like that this is like a middle middle of Shannon to day two maybe after dinner we're in the money well into the money blinds are 5k 10k and basically I just put the effective stack in which is 175 K which is 17.5 big blinds so pretty basic spot it's gonna fold to this guy who moves all in for 175,000 there's actually a mistake here he was actually in the LoJack not the hijack so this players in the high the LoJack and moves all in for 17.5 big blinds and it's gonna fold through us in the big blind and we have ace Jack offsuit so a couple things here this player was very aggressive he was a good player he kind of he knew what he was doing he was also a little spew II he got out of line a little bit he was an aggressive three better preflop and he had just recently lost a kind of annoying pot and I wasn't sure kind of what his mental state was so basically we have an aggressive player who's shoved all in now for seventeen and a half big blinds my stack was like 210 thousand so I have 210 thousand just barely covering him it's basically for all my chips and I need to find out if I should fold or if I should call here and the questions I want to ask here are one is ace Jack kind of in real-time what I kind of do here in real-time is and this is my thought process is like what would I do with one hand worse so if I had a son off here what would I do and I was pretty confident a son off is a very easy fold ace Jack offsuit felt like the borderline hand and then if I had a screen off suit so I go one above and one below ace queen offsuit I knew I would be calling I thought ace-queen offsuit was a very easy call ace 10 off suit a very easy fold and so now I kind of have this middle-aged Jack han which I'm not sure what to do with anyone else having a problem with the audio cutting in and out so this ace jack-off suit I'm not sure what to do with seems like Bob it seems like everyone else is having the audio is doing just fine maybe refresh Bob that might be the best bet so basically I ended up calling with the ace Jack and we're not even gonna look at what his hand was we're not gonna look at what his hand was because it's irrelevant but we made the call here with ace Jack so question theme of this webinar how do I find out if I made the correct call or not so we've set up the situation here and we are gonna use hold them resources calculator this little program here this is a cool little program so Hold'em resources calculator I've already run the hand I'll show you really quickly how we would do this we're gonna go to basic hand I already have this all loaded in here everyone has a hundred and seventy-five thousand chips 5k 10k blinds it's a ten thousand Bay boy Danny but I just put a thousand that's about close enough it's not gonna make that big of a difference we're gonna go finish here and we'll gonna get this result and it's gonna look like this Jonathan where you're asking is exactly where you asked me a question where you type to where can I ask the presenter a question just go ahead and type a question there and I'll handle them all at the end of the webinar so what this basic program does is show you the every hand and the profitability of shoving or folding so for example here the under the gun player can shove these green hands so for example aces when it says plus five point one five big blinds on average aces are going to make five big blinds it's shoving here with ace-queen off see he's gonna be making about a half a big blank calling then some of these really marginal ones like Queen 10 student makes point oh two big blinds calling so I wouldn't be calling with that Han because it's really marginal so what we're gonna do here the first step is I have this process that I use with HRC so because everything we do is made up based off of assumptions so we really don't know what hands this guy is shoving with if we knew exactly what his range was we have a super easy way to figure it out cuz we just plug in his range and then it spits out what hands we should call with and what hands we shouldn't call with so this is the way that I go through trying to get the best range possible and to figure out the adjustments first we're gonna look at theory so the theory these are the absolutely if he was playing like a computer and I was playing at a bike a computer this is what would happen so cut off hijacked LoJack so mp2 if he was playing like a computer he could shove in with like pocket fours or better a sate suited this would be the range that he has so this is every profitable shove that he has you see threes here it's doing like 42 percent of the times it's a zero evie shove this is these are all profitable hands to shove with and then in theory we click on the down arrow because he's the down arrow he's raised to 174,000 and we go to big blind and these are the hands we should call with so he's 10 suited or better a stock offer better king queen suited and sixes are better so those are the hands we should call with in theory if we were to computers playing against each other so here ace jack-off would make 1.2 big blinds when we call that's a very big edge generally in a tournament like this that's very soft I'll probably take everything that's above like point four 0.3 so excuse me basically half and sixes you're better I'm gonna call with I'd probably just call with every hand here in the green king queen suited it's kind of close probably call with but these are this is the theory okay so in theory these are the numbers so we have that one now we're gonna go with the worst case scenario so what we're gonna do is so we know in theory ace jack-off is a very easy call in theory though he's not shoving all these hands this isn't how he plays no one plays exactly like the computer so we need to adjust the ranges and first we're gonna adjust them to the extreme one way or the other so worst-case scenario would be he shoves extremely tight and we overestimate how he's shoving way too tight so first let's look at that let's take out aces because no one really shoves all-in for eighteen big ones with aces they're normally gonna make a small small raise and try to induce someone to go all and same with Kings we can kind of safely assume that he's not doing it with kings but let's say he's doing it with Queens this is the worst case scenario so worst case scenario he doesn't shove any of these small pairs let's just say like pocket eights are better he never shows these marginal you know let's take out a Stenson a king tendency to these suited Broadway's so we're giving them a really tight shoving range here let's give him something like this eight plus eight through Queens king queen suited ace queen so we're just trying to give them the extreme range so we give them that range we go back to big blind which is us we click best response so now we could see our range is change and ace jack-off suit is a really really really bad call we're losing almost four big blinds calling so we obviously should be folding that even ace Queen suited is break even ace queen off is severely losing basically you nines is like we're probably call with nines but it's not doing that well tens plus Ace King is now our calling range so so yeah we've looked at it from that point of view and now we think okay ace jack-off in that point is a very easy fold would I run it here so now we're gonna look at the best-case scenario so the best-case scenario would be let's let's make some adjustments on his range so best-case scenario so let's like think if we're really optimistic I wouldn't say this is best-case I'd say this is most optimistic scenario most optimistic scenario would be he doesn't ever shove with aces kings queens jacks tens he's always inducing with those hands he's gonna raise and try to get someone to shove all that over the top so he never has tons or aces plus we're gonna say he never has ace king suited as well because he would do the same trying to induce a raise but being optimistic he racing off we're gonna take that off King Jack off we're gonna take that off King Queen off it's a pretty marginal shove here in his position so we'll take that out ace jack is clearly a plus e V shove form we're gonna give them take out threes and fours let's take out five and say yeah let's say he shoves this and then I think people way over shove you know these weak suited ace is so let's leave let's take H five shoot it out shoot it out Queen nine King nine Jack nine so yeah let's give them this range which is H unite let's even let's give them tons because we're flipping against ten so tens through six is big off suit aces and then all the suited broad ways in the strongest suit of connectors like Jack ten suited ten nine seeded this is I think reasonable these are hands that are he doesn't really want to raise and then have to fold like I could see a scenario where this guy goes well have Kington suited I have 17 big blinds I don't want to raise and then when someone goes all-in I have to fold my hands so I'm just gonna go online myself so you know it's okay if I get called I have a pretty good hand so I think this is a optimistic but also a realistic scenario that someone could shove with so we lock that range in we go back to us we click best response it recalculates it and we get to this where it's okay sevens plus a stents to did a screen off so now we can see our hand ace Jack offsuit is about 0.7 not as profitable as a lot of these other hands that you see but it's still profitable but it's not like a fist pump slam dunk call it still it's still kind of close so the worst scenario we found out that it's a bad call really really bad called the best-case scenario it's like alright it's a good call but it's not a slam dunk call so let's kind of figure out I ran it earlier which one did I run okay so this is the range I kind of settled on I gave them king queen in this one sure let's just go with this so this is kind of a range that I gave them and best response so this one is the main difference through this one basically is the king queen let's take that out really quick and then see this response so yeah so you see how I'm kind of just playing away when we took out king queen it went from when we give him king queen [Music] it goes to ace jack is a 1.16 so a really good call it's winning over a big blind and at mp2 if we take out the king queen then it's not only now it's like almost a point five difference it doubles in value so we always want to be conservative so we're not gonna give them the king queen and you know even if we start to take out some of these like queen ten to the king ten cities that we're not sure if he's shoving or not it'd be pretty optimistic you know ace Jack here is pretty break-even at like 0.3 0.2 so basically what I figured out now is ace Jack is somewhere between a really really bad call and a okay call you know it's never a wow this is an amazing hand to call with ace Queen as you can see here like in this scenario ace queen is two point five five which is like a fist pump have to call every time so there's a big difference here between ace Jack and ace Queen because ace Jack only dominates a few of the suited aces that he shows but ace queen dominates all the ACE Jack's that he shoves so we kind of come on in the median range here and it's still kind of a marginal call so I think the key takeaway here is that in my analysis of this hand I would say that I have a pretty good skill edge in this tournament it's really soft that the one case started with a 8,000 players there's like 500 left I heard a really good quote from Matt Berkey last week on a podcast and I've always known this in my head but just hearing stuff again just reiterate and he kind of made a point about when they were deep in a tournament and he felt like one of his friends kind of made a mistake and he's told them you know if you had the option 1 out of 10 times to be the chip leader or 10 out of 10 times to just be in the tournament with 10 big blinds or any chips at all which would you choose and he said you should without a doubt choose being in the tournament 10 out of 10 times rather than being the chip leader 1 out of 10 because in these soft filled tournaments the quote he is was your button the seat is worth way way more than the chip lead in any tournament because just having you you know being in the tournament he's gonna turn into the chip lead some of the time to so I think ace jack-off here is to marginal of a call I think the ACE Queen is for sure I call ace Jack suited almost for sure a call so I'd probably be calling like 7th + ace Jack suited + ace Queen off + that would be my calling range in this spot and the key takeaway I want you to take away from this spot is how I played around with the ranges so I did the theory in theory it was a really good call was one point to the worst case it was so let's do this it was plus one point - I think it was the worst case he was - like three point - best case was like plus one point - ish and the median was like point four so based off of our assumptions you know we always want to be very conservative with our assumptions cuz we just really don't know and it would be this horrendous I would just be punting money on fire if I call here and ends up being the worst case scenario maybe this guy is shoving maybe even he shoves Kings to try to like trick me you know thinking he's weak who knows people do that so in review of this hand I called in real-time he had a squeen which is one of the hands I knew he would always probably be shoving so that I didn't really learn too much about his range and I hit a jack doubled up I doubled up in the hand and won it got lucky versus ace queen and then ended up busting like I don't know like four hundred and fiftieth or something like that but the key thing was here and here's something to point out - the villain showed me ace Queen I didn't really learn anything at all because I know he's shoving ace Queen I was pretty confident with that but if he would've shoved like turned over King Queen off then I learned a lot because King Queen off was one of those hands that turns ace jack into a very profitable call if I see him shoving Jack ten suited I learned something that makes a Jack a very profitable call if I see him shoving ace ten off if he shows ace ten off here then ace jack is a slam-dunk all so that's kind of the process here of how you want to go through these push fold spots Hold'em resources calculator really cool program to use and you can do this on reshubs so when someone raises you can see what shove hands you should go all-in with lots of stuff we have one more hammer we'll be using both on this next hand we're gonna be using both HRC and piosolver so this is probably gonna be this second hand we do we'll probably the last one this will take another 10 15 minutes and then we'll go into questions let's just do this okay the same so in this hand this is from the big 50 big 50 tournament that have like 30,000 people this is in day two already in the money of one of the flights I can't remember I played a lot of them so in this hand we have King six of diamonds the big blind and it folds to a really strong regular who has like half a million so like 50 big blinds he knows who I am he's a party poker sponsored European Pro that I know that plays well and he has been limping since I got down to like ten to 20 big blinds and there was a small blind was short he started limping so his ranges are a little different because he was limping and this hand he raised to 20,000 on the button small blindfolds and it's on me with the King six of diamonds in the big blind so King six of diamonds big blind facing him in raised we're never folding but I didn't know if it was best to go all-in preflop here or to just call and I think it's really close and in real time I remember thinking it was close so like I say the beginning first we have some questions and the first question that I have in this hand should I be calling or calling preflop and we can kind of use hold them resources calculator again to figure this out so this is whole this hand and holding resources calculator basically we go to advance hand I have another hand in there so basically when you input everything you can put in that so the button raises to 20,000 right here it's raised to 20,000 and we have two options call 10,000 right here or three that all-in for 150,000 these are our two options so this is the range that it says the button should be raising so first we're gonna go through theory because that's what I do in these pots so in theory it says you the button should be raising 34.4% of hands and this is a key part that I've talked about in short stacks pot look at this key part calling and three betting we should be defending a hundred percent of hands so 81 point 9 percent call and 18.1% shove and that seems very reasonable because we are getting a very good price and in general you're always gonna have the odds to call on men raise but there's a key part to it which I will get into so it's a good well first let's look at look at the numbers first so these are the hands saying I should call the 10k with and their values so what we're gonna do is we want to compare the value of the expected value of calling the 10k with King six diamonds and three betting 250 K so this is the call table and what all these numbers are this is important is this is the expected value when you call and so hold the resources calculator doesn't do anything post flop it's all preflop so what it's assuming here is that you call and the hand is checked down to the river so that's obviously not the case the hand is never checked down to the river but when you're you're very short stacked we're almost always going to like we can realize all our equity almost in a way we're gonna realize a lot of our equity when we're short stack because we can just hit a pair and then go all-in or if we flop a flush draw we're always gonna see the river or if we flop a straight draw we're always gonna see the river because we're so short stack so we can kind of take these numbers a little bit for what they are so here it's saying King six suited is plus one point two three to call with and remember that's assuming that it gets checked down to the river all the time which it doesn't so we probably don't realize all of this plus one point two three in reality it the number is less because say we call them and the flop comes ace eight four and we check he bets now we fold our King succeeded he could have had Queen Jack and we folded out you know 60% of our equity so maybe we realize eighty percent of this or ninety percent of this number it's hard to say but we're doing it for comparison shoving Kings exuded is worth plus 1.06 so these numbers are actually really close 1.06 and 1.23 and when you compare that you know you say okay maybe we realize 80% of this one point two three or seventy-five eighty ninety you know shoving and Colin probably have pretty equal value so that's the number one thing I took away from my preflop question was it's very close between shove and call shoving was 1.06 calling was one point two six the important thing this is equilibrium so this is the theory this is the theory point basically this is what we would be doing if we were computers so the computer would probably be pretty and difference between calling and shoving and the key point with the call tap is equity realization so in the call tab Evie is if your hand is checked onto the river you have to take into account equity realization we're not gonna realize all of our equity because we're playing out of position and then the key thing here is this really only works when you're short status when you're deep stock your equity realization can be low as 50 or 60 percent so you might only realize 50 or 60 percent of your equity so we're gonna look at a couple of different hands to King ten suited nine eight suited to see their evey difference between calling and shoving Oh first we're actually gonna do this so this is I reran the range i widened his button raising range a little bit to about 38% I think this is a very reasonable range that this player will be raising on the button so about thirty nine percent of the hands and then oh here we go and then the key one here is and then I Rea this is the hands that he will call our shove with so Oh key thing I took out four threes and deuces from his range because I think he just opened shoves those hands suits they're way more profitable to just open shove so when he when I shove all in I think he calls with pocket fives are better any suited ace I think he might fold some of these weaker offsuit aces oh yeah I think he folds some of these weaker offsuit aces as you can see they're pretty bad calls versus my shoving range this is the range right he said that he calls with so he raised folds like some of these Kington off queen eight suited so this is the range he calls our shove with and then now this is the range that we should be kind of shoving with Kings exuded is about one making one big line and calling it's making about 1.4 so callings looking pretty attractive here with the King six suited the one of the key things I want to point out here before we go in because this hand goes post flop and we're gonna start to use piosolver their hands that are super profitable they're just way more profitable shove we're always going to shove them so like all these pocket pairs big suited connectors big suited aces officer aces they're just really profitable shoves so we're gonna take that spawn shove the hands we wanted to look at Kington suited in King nine suited let's look at the Evie difference between calling and shoving so let's look at 9/8 suited nine eight suited calling is worth about one point one seven and three betting is worth about one point one seven so this shove and the call option on nine eight student are equal and the reason is is because when we shove with the nine eight suited he's gonna fold a lot of these nines he's folding King nine off queen nine off we fold out a lot of hands that dominate us also all these eights that dominate us so shoving these ten nine eight nine eight suited is really good it's way better than calling because you fold out hands that dominate you and even when you get called you still have really good equity and that's one of the biggest properties when you're trying to decide should I go all-in or should I just call with a hand the there's a few questions you should ask yourself it's one can I ever get called by hand that I dominate so can I be called by him that I dominate to can I get a hand that dominates me to fold so for example if you have nine eight suited can you go all-in will East nine fold their King nine fold well in this case ten nine Jack down Queen nine King nine you get a lot of hands that you can dominate you to fold and then the final you know does my hand perform well in Owen situation yeah nine eight suit it performs pretty well when it gets called you know it's doing pretty well against hands like a squeenix Jackie's ten king queen suited etc it has pretty good equity king ten suited is another one we wanted to look at that's kind of the break-even point I think of calling and shoving so calling is worth about one point seven eight and shoving is worth about one point seven one and King tends to just start to get to the point where you don't get any like dominate two hands to fold like you can get King Jack offsuit to fold I think King Jack off is that calling King Jack offs like breakeven so it might be folding to your shop so that's like the one hand you can get to shove but yeah you can kind of play around with this a lot I don't want to spend too much time on it but always keep in mind what dominated hands are you getting two fold what dominating hands are calling you and how well is your hand perform so in this spot we did call and the flop comes ten six for rainbow and we're gonna go into pile silver now to try to get a general idea of how we should proceed post flop and I on this spot actually first let's do so yeah actually go right into here this is the setup so basically we've taken everything from what we just learned in HRC this is our range we're gonna be shoving with all these weak stronger a sexes every pocket pair we're shoving with and then I just gave us half way on all these like kind of hands that were in different on shoving or calling and then everything else I just gave us a call we should I give us a hundred percent of hands as we saw in HRC it's pretty you know we could probably fold out some of this trash sure stuff I probably should have taken some of that out like eighty-three off like this bottom part of the grid I probably shouldn't have that in there that's probably a mistake by me it won't change a ton in position is that same 38 percent range that we gave them starting pot is 55 effective sacks or 110 so two-to-one SPR and then we have various bet sizes that we gave them in positioning about like 20% or 45% on the flop 25 50 or 75 on the turn and 40 or 80 on the river we're gonna have some resizes and then out of position we can donk lead the flop for 25 or 50 percent we have some bet sizes a bunch of different options and this is what has been formulated first thing I always use on a piyo solver we talked about it in the last two webinars equity so we have about 41 percent equity on this flop and in position has the remaining so about 58 percent we can look at evey in positions count getting about 35 out of 55 we're getting back about 20 out of 55 and then the second strategy or the second thing that I always look at is the range Explorer and you saw this tool last time last couple times on my webinar and I think this is extremely important to figure out strategies I'm actually first let's look through our basic flop strategy I didn't include a lead because and this is kind of what I thought when the SPR gets shallower we're at an SPR of two here we do start doing some leading into the preflop raiser here because we just don't get punished even though we have a weaker range and we want to have some protection when you're short stack it's all about protecting your equity so we'll look through this really quick as you can see we can do some leading with some of our tens what do we do some six is king six suited our hand has actually led some of the time so as you can see we lead some of our stronger sixes and some of these sixes with a backdoor straight draw four fours we're checking almost all of our 4x so we do some leadings with 6x + 10 X and then it looks like we lead some of these straight draws like eight seven seven five five three suited ace three off so we do some leading with some of this stuff so that's an keep in mind that we can do some leading here so that's one takeaway that I would take a takeaway from this is that we can definitely do some leading but this is what happened to the hand so I checked and this is the imposition strategy so first question I wanted to ask myself was now what does the flop in position check see betting range look like and then I was do I ever leave the flop so do I ever leave this flop yes about 20% about 15% of the time it looked like and then now we're gonna look at what is the flop in position see betting range look like so as you can see he's betting about 70% of the time in terms of sizing I gave him 20% and a 45% sizing and then the all-in sizing which is pretty much never used so and as you can see in position is betting 20% pot about 62% of the time so he's pretty much only betting a 20% strategy which is kind of what I thought should happen in game and as you can see here the it's betting pretty much so I always like to go buy the pair so every time is betting sixes every six is pretty much betting other than its weak ones that have backdoor straight draws and then fours just the ACE four is betting and then what is it doing with some of these straight draws like nine eight seven so the nine eight and the eight sevens are checking back a decent amount and that's because they don't want to have to bet call off if I check shove this flop like five three doesn't have fives fives and sixes or five key thing here is imposition is checking back tens and sixes and you'll see why it has it doing it on the next thing and what I did on the turn a lot of these two over cards it's just got you know some of these the Strongs the checks are coming from a lot of these like ace nine to over cards to the six basically start to check a little bit more king queen king jack but in general the key takeaway here is that in position should be betting a lot for a really small size and then it has some kind of intuitive checks with some hands that just don't want a bet fold in game the player checked behind and the turn was the three of diamonds and this is now kind of my strategy now on the turn the pile called solving and this is really interesting and way way way way different than I would have thought to do in game so I should have had one of my question is what is my turn strategy look like and here we see basically we bet everything for sizings the sizes i included were twenty five fifty and a hundred and then the all-in sizing so it looks like the predominantly it's using like the fifty percent and the 100 percent pot so yeah we're betting pretty much everything other than like these queen Jack King Jack type hands the King succeded is pure bet between 28 and 55 which is the 50% 100% sizing the key takeaway here is once you check back the big blind just starts going crazy because as you can see when we were looking at the this checking range they're not really checking anything and that's the reason that he started checking tens and sixes because they don't need any protection and they can induce a lot of Bluffs on the turn so in reality I would probably almost just bet everything pure as in position and check three diamonds because I don't think anyone is betting enough on the turn here from that a position I did in game I bet the King six suited for half pot so I was pretty happy with that I think I might even bet two-thirds pot so I was pretty spot on that I should be betting my king six for protection and for value to set up a shell on the river so key takeaway here is that we should just be blasting away here on the turn once it goes to check check I knew my hand was a bet but I didn't know I should just be ramming it with like hands like nine three suited for protection and value the nine for off ten for off even though Queen eight off here we should be bluffing a lot with King five off we should be bluffing going crazy with like we just be going crazy on this turn card in a general strategy because we look at the equities we have an equity advantage once it goes check check we're at 52% so I bet 28 and our opponent called which wasn't she surprising and then the river was the deuce of clubs so this is another surprising one again we're just supposed to go crazy on this River we have the shove at eighty percent and that forty percent I think it is at forty and eighty yeah bet forty about eighty embed all in which is the betting online would be like three-quarters pot king succeeded it says a shoving and I was confused if it's shoving as a bluff or for value and I found out it's shoving for value because when I shove here in position was supposed to call with hands like seven six suited eight six suited ace for King for a three ace deuce like it's calling with a lot of hands easy in position is even supposed to call with ace king through ace Jack some another time and this is a key point that this is a key point I want to point out when you're using a program like this and this is like what people how people misuse this program and make big mistakes I would never shove King six suited for value here because in the real world in game no one is I don't think anyone's really calling here with like the seven six the King for the ace three the ace you know all these weak pairs ace queen Ace King ace Jack no one's calling with that Ace King ace Queen ace Jack barely anyone is like calling with these hands so shoving with King succeeded is kind of a disaster on this river because you just don't get called enough for four value so basically we've seen how aggressive out of position is supposed to play and in response and positions just calling a ton on this her in reality what happened though I didn't shove I was pretty confident that now on the deuce I was gonna shove a lot of a verse but on the dues a lot of my Bluffs get there or make a pair or make it straight now and so I just didn't think I was gonna be called very often so that was my thinking of like I didn't think I would get called by seven six or aced for King for the hands that pie was always calling with I don't think it's happening so I checked and now the imposition player went all-in so you know we'll pull it up here just so you can see the action now it went Ray's call check check I bet he called the river was the deuce I checked he shoved and I folded that was what happened so now I was concerned about on the river should I ever be calling and let's look at this strategy to see like I thought he could have hands like aces kings and queens those hands make sense that he wanted to check back tens and sixes make sense that he want to check back pocket fives makes a lot of sense nine eight and eight seven those are the hands in game I thought where his Bluffs for sure he almost for sure has those and he never has the officer combo so there's for like eight combos of Bluffs he could have maybe the 972 that makes him sense that check that call river but I just don't think he ever ends up with these Queen seven and Jack seven students that pile calls that turn with for two overs to the six and a gutshot I don't think he calls with those I don't think he shoves the King for suited you know ace queen he's like I don't think he ever finds this ace king Bluff for these fractions of a squeenix jack so basically I don't think he's bluffing enough here on the river and I think I have an easy check fold now with the King six a couple of takeaways here one in position should be very aggressive on this flop for a very small sizing so we've looked at a lot of complicated cell phenomena boil it down to a few key points that I learned in this hand review imposition needs to be very aggressive and he's just using like a 20% sizing once in position checks back big blind can just go crazy on any card basically on the lower half of the deck this is a cool turn this is the run out grid so this shows every turn card and what should we be doing and you can clearly see here any turn card below a nine or a ten especially these do streets for fives like we just get a play very aggressively on as the big blind and then ace king queens and Jack's we just always are pretty much checking with our range but as you can see like the bottom half of the cards are much better for us like out of position equity this is where you see like we're gonna have an equity advantage on basically all these small cards and then the big cards are really bad for us like the aces the Kings the Queen's these reds are really bad turn cards for us yellows are better turn cards for us so on these low turn cards after go to check check here we can kind of just go crazy with everything and then on this river again certain opponents like you could go really really thin for value as thin as a hand like King succeeded and then you as you can see you can just start bluffing like crazy and you're supposed to be bluffing like crazy here because as you can see like when we shove here he's supposed to call with King four and ace three and ace deuce and I just don't see that happening so like an adjustment I would be making here is I would be probably over bluffing in the spot and not value betting a ton because I don't expect my opponent to call a lot here on the river so I would actually be really imbalanced and just be shoving a ton as a bluff so I like even like a hand of Jack's abuse I'd started just shoving it as a bluff or checking it like nine five suited for sure or that's a straight now ninety seven to nine seven eight seven nine eight for sure shoving the like what other see this is the right it's harvest because we don't have a lot of bluffs on this river everything we have a pair now so like Jack nine Queen ten Queen ten off or sorry Queen Jack Queen nine it's really hard to find a lot of Bluffs here because we have a pair so you either have to start turning a lot of pairs into a bluff or just start shoving for value really way it's a it's a really interesting spot because of the run out of this board and I want to do a little more in-depth research on this hand still a little bit we're going a little bit long so but yeah the the key part of this we got a little technical the key part of this was how do you some software to analyze hands and find the answers for yourself cuz finding the answers for yourself is really really important to developing your poker game and strategies and other spots so now I just know like you know almost chuck 'chuck spots how aggressive I can go as a short stack you know I can just go for it a lot and then on the shoving you know the first hand I learned a lot on the closest between calling and calling in a shoving preflop and then in that ace Jack hand I learned a lot about you know that's one of my weaknesses I think I call those sheds a little too light there's fifteen to seventeen big blonde shove so I think I should have folded the ace Jack and gone with the ace queen or better so summary all the resources calculator is an essential tool you really need to be on the shove caller fold spots on the short stack higher work don't try to blindly copy the strategy but just try to understand it use the range Explorer and equities and then homework this is what if you want to take this to the next level take five to ten all in and fold preflop spots from either live poker online poker doesn't matter and analyze them through Hold'em resources calculator or ICM eyes or whatever program you use and you know adjust the runs it ranges play around with it and come with the best assumptions and learn kind of what the borderline has to call with our change the stack sizes around see how that affects things so that wraps up that webinar part will get to questions in a minute we'll have 5 to 10 minutes for questions but there is something new coming to poker coaching comm Jonathan is launching poker coaching premium and poker coaching premiums gave me a new membership

complicated stuff I hope you were able to digest that well let's but yeah let's get into your question so someone said earlier if you google if you go on YouTube you can just type into YouTube Jonathan little poker how do I take notes of the table and Jonathan has the on YouTube jonathan has the how he takes his notes at the table for his hands if you don't hear me talking it's cuz I'm going through some of the questions from the webinar first bruce says yeah he's using Jonathan's pushed fold shove app and it's a marginal call yep so we confirmed through HRC so that's a key thing here Bruce so you use the Jonathan's push shove app which is great and you're able to very very quickly identify that that ace-jack was a marginal call so that's great but now through HRC you can go in and do the fine details and figure out why it's a marginal call and you really need to dig deep into it to figure out why it is in order to understand the topic better and actually be able to implement it in game can if there are two all ends ahead of you will that program war - yes you can just it's just a constant drop down menu so you can you can go through and do everyone's all in in front of you so Bruce said the opportunity you know deep is key in the ace-jack hand to call with obviously I'm trying to go deep but we're already in the money so ICM isn't that relevant right now and I'm just trying to maximize chips and the key the key thing is is I'm in at a very soft field and I don't need to take a marginal spot because I can kind of hold out and someone is gonna dump their chips to me because they're so weak and it's like in one of these tournaments the other day I had someone with like defend the big blind with Jack deuce which was fine he had Jack deuce suited three ways he defended and it came Jack seven three and it went check check I see bet and then the guy just went all-in for like 40 big lines and I had an over pair and snapped called and busted them and it's like people are just gonna hand you their chips and that spot is worth so much to me and just being around in the tournament and waiting for those spots when there's not many poor players that are gonna do it it's it's really important to just remain in the tournament Nate so you talking about the King six of diamonds if we think it's that close you got a shove there for max value real time I call though so it's not about shoving or like getting Max value getting maximum value for me there was actually calling is because Colleen has a higher Evie than shoving and so yeah when you when you go all-in you either double up or you fold or you either win like two big blinds you double up or you get busted but when calling it's just you get a keep in hands like seven six or Queen six suited or excuse me I keep in all these hands that I'd dominate that I can actually win you know double up through versus when I shove they just full and also when the flop comes King high that's the card he's gonna Bluff a lot and so I pick up a lot of equity when he starts bluffing these King high boards Lee I'm not entirely sure yet I found out about this that's a question you want to email to support into Jonathan if we signed up Lee as if we just signed up to the current size can we transfer across to the Premium Subscription or do you need both I'm pretty sure you're gonna be able to transfer across they I'm assuming they might be charging a little more for the premium but I'm not a hundred percent sure yeah I don't have all the information yet on the premium yeah Martin looking forward to learning more about the premium yeah I think more information should be coming out that in the next couple weeks I'm assuming Jonathan's gonna be talking about that a lot more in his upcoming webinars so I would pay attention just keep your heads up that's me start at the end of the month bill with the free version of piyo solver be of any value I think I use the free version as a trial but I think you can only solve flops I mean it would be of a little value myself I don't have the edge which is the really expensive one because it takes way too much computer power and the the main thing is about the edge is that you can do preflop the pro version which I had I think was five or six hundred the the main version the main advantage of the pro over the next lower one is the pro you can run scripts versus the other one you can't and scripts are really really really cool scripts are the coolest thing about piyo I think so basically what a script is is I'll take a spot like when I was playing six max cash and study in six months cash online I took a spot button opens two two and a half big blinds I call in the big blind and then I can make a script where it generates a hundred different flops and then it runs the program for all 100 flops it takes like 15 hours or something so I'll do it overnight and when I wake up the next day I will have a hundred different flops solved for that whole situation and it's so powerful then cuz what I'll do is I'll quiz myself and I'll go through basically we'll all 100 flops for whatever situation I set up and I'll guess the equities of both players and I'll try to guess the strategy of both players in the situation like in position should be betting seventy percent of the time for the small sizing or I'll guess in positions should be checking a ton and only betting the big size because they don't have a much equity advantage and so it's such a good way to practice in quiz yourself there's a good YouTube video on on it I can't remember it right now I watched it a while ago but there are really effective ways to use piles over and there are very ineffective ways to use piles over so de matar your question I brought us through pious oversight and I've seen there are different products starting from 250 to 1k which version do you recommend I kind of just touched on that in general I wouldn't be concerned with getting pile silver unless you're playing for a living get a program like flop Zilla or equal AB which we've talked about in my previous webinars they cost a tenth of the price and the main things you want from pile silver are the equities in the range Explorer and you can do those on those programs yeah card runners Eevee Wagner I think is similar but I don't have much experience with it I just exited out someone asked so will poker coaching members not have access to these webinars I believe what's gonna happen is they're gonna be separate webinars for the premium and the regular but I'm not a hundred percent sure yeah I haven't been given all the information yet from Jonathan so I would just keep posted I'm sure there's gonna be emails about it there'll be a lot of information you guys will get cleared on that fine John saying you can become an all like in these tournaments you can be easily become an all-in or Nothing position so the attitude to remain in the tournament do you see a stronger gut factor of the player involved basically all I'm trying to do is put the player to the range and then decide what my best options should be after that and then stuff like how well does the player play post ball how is he gonna make mistakes how well will he let me realize my equity a lot of those like type of questions will go into my factor of do I ever call do you Roberto do you still get any coaching or do you talk hands with friends at your level yeah I talk hands with friends with people right now I'm not coached I've gotten coached in the past in general my main way is I'm kind of I wouldn't say a lone wolf but like I've been just working on my game my own kind of doing my own stuff it's really hard to find other good poker players that have really good work ethics there's a lot of really smart poker players but it's it's hard to find once I have good work ethics and then also ones that like I've worked on this a lot and I used to be very poorly explaining what I'm thinking in poker and maybe I still him I've gotten a lot better at it though I think and so there's a big difference between being a really good poker player and being able to explain your thoughts in poker well Julius yeah it's a good point in this situation is the waste risk worth the reward seems to be the question that should be pondered mostly yes and then the main question I ask myself is that with King SiC suited if I go all-in does he fold any hands that I dominate yeah you hold some you know stronger Kings in mine and he might fold like a six off versus if I just call I'll ask myself do I keep any hands in I dominate myself and so those are two really key points because those are how you double up or how you get stacked is you know when you both flop prepare your your ticker yeah Dan I the premium though should be some more information here in the coming week I would think Nate yeah training sites now it's so much easier now to get really good at poker than it was 10 years ago when I started I had a lot of access to you know I remember when Johnny backs opened their first site I'm gonna stop the recording right now just we're going a little

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assasin Otto doing another one of my webinars for Jonathan little today's topic is cutoff theory how to manufacture two buttons if I were to tell you hey let's play a poker tournament but in this poker tournament I'll get the button two or three times in orbit you will only get the button once would you want to play in this game in today's webinar you will learn how to earn the betting lead from the cutoff more often how to make it so that your cutoff plays like the button how to squeeze the button and blinds out from playing post flop and how to win more money in tournament poker let's get started alright so take a look at this situation to me this is one of the most fascinating situations in poker it gets folded to you about 30 acts you got five seven suited decent an but not great to me this is so fascinating why because if the dealer the player on the dealer button knows how to play and you don't hear this hand is essentially worthless however if you know how to play and the button does not then you can steal his position I love stealing the button from the LoJack hijacker cut off nothing makes me happier than getting heads up or even multi way with the small blind and big blind why because the worst player at any table is always the players in the blinds look up your statistics on hold a manager sometime that's literally where all your losses are coming from it's not your fault either just you're out of position with money in the middle already so you know you have to defend wider but most people don't know how much they are supposed to defend there so these days people usually defend too much and that creates profitability edges for me I want you to have these edges as well so let's look at this hand alright what would you do here if the button is a young guy good but not blowing you away with his play we'll do maybe 10 seconds for this one so in the chat what you guys think we got one fold and got one st. 1,200 another 1600 all right I think you guys know your answer here so I stopped the timer time is up what would you do in this situation so imagine you're on the button now you have about 30 big blinds what would you do in this situation if you were facing a race from the top so the blinds are 200 400 with a nanny and the cutoff makes it 1,400 you have twelve thousand eight hundred chips honestly what would you do if you were deep in a tournament and you saw this situation it's hard to do anything right what in the hell could you three bet two that doesn't commit your entire stack now how about this situation you have twelve thousand eight hundred blinds are two hundred four hundred with a nanny and the cutoff from 33 acts makes it eight hundred how much more welcoming and familiar does this situation look look at how much easier it is to three bet here how much room you have and now the cutoff is defending for his whole stack you're making a two thousand win 38 hundred he's gonna have to do 13,000 to do anything about what you just did there no if you're in the cutoff here let's do the right thing and raise to an amount that puts 25 to 40 big blind stacks the most common mid-game stacks in an awkward spot what tends to happen when I do this is that the big blind calls ooh let's do another one real quick what would you do here if check 2 so after you raise their preflop in big blank called and word comes king of clubs Jack of Diamonds to a clubs what would you do and if you specify B you must say an amount let's see what people are saying in the chat I'll read it out because I have the chat off-screen well it's not shad it's all kind of like questions we got bet 1700 we got bet 3000 we got bet 11 working on fundamentals here today you can bet a small bet is fine there like 1100 1500 is fine I don't think you want to go too big just because there's 2 cards above a nine but his range is wide enough that he has enough ten six of hearts that are folding that a very small bet can be appropriate now to figure out how much this needs to work this is a some of you guys have seen this before but this is very basic poker math and I'm very surprised how many people don't know this so I'm just gonna review it really quickly to find out how much any of your bets needs to work you take how much you're risking divided by how much is gonna come back into your stack when it should the bets exceed so if you think about it if you and I are flipping coins for $50 each you wouldn't divide 50 by what you stand to win which is 50 because then it says you have to win the coin flip a hundred percent of the time no if you're risking 50 to win 50 you do fifty divided by a hundred then you get 50 percent makes sense right it's the same thing when you're see betting as a bluff if you're risking fifteen hundred and forty nine hundred comes back to your stack should you succeed that means this bet as an absolute Bluff needs to work thirty percent of the time so what percentage of the time does our opponent need to be defending seventy percent of the time 70 percent of the time he needs to be defending and as we can see that's gonna be very difficult should he be calling out of the big blind with a very wide range and this isn't even that wide I know many I was just calling the action for a small poker tournament and I didn't see anyone at the final table when you would think they would be on best behavior folding to any size raised with any hand 9/5 offsuit was calling there and that's a deep into this territory here so but we can see even if they're just calling you with the really good suited connectors in the good aces and things like that even slow playing some really good hands like jacks tens nines what you'll notice is even if this guy is defending a gutshot any pair so like ace deuce he doesn't fold he is only defending 61.5% of the time which means he's folding 38.5% of a time and that's even if he calls you with a gut shot right they si gut shots and whatnot in the queen nine and whatnot that's why I love attacking this big blind as you can see there's just no way for this guy to play well unless he's got a check raised in his game which many guys do not have people are more willing to fold to these smaller bets out of position to when they feel your big preflop raise indicates knit strength and because they called with so many preflop hands I love that big raised preflop I learned that from so funny I was playing uh this isn't in my notes but just uh I was playing in Dublin and all the old codgers there right like the 50 60 70 year old guys they would raise to like 3.5 X and the internet kids would piss and moan and they wouldn't three bet them and then they would call it at the big blind and then they would check fold the flop because they go okay yeah like old man coffee you got like eight plus a screen plus there and I'm just losing my mind because I kept thinking you're just gonna give him 3.5 enix every time that's an excellent move to do now if he's got 5 7 suited or whatnot so that's what got me thinking about this and that's why I love large raises nobody folds from the big blank ever now especially with the big blind ante this is a golden era of Poker that continuation bet would not work on that board if we received that a team of three that pot it wouldn't work versus a 12% cold-calling range but it's money the bank heads-up versus the big blind in why it wouldn't work in a three-bet pot or why it wouldn't work in a cold versus a cold calling range is because in three bit pots or vs. cold callers players have much better hands those are much tighter ranges but the big blind has 30 40 50 percent of the hands oftentimes now a lot of people ask me but isn't this exploitable yes it is an exploitative line so it can be exploited but let me give you another example of an exploitative line let's say you have a huge fish in your game who loves to call from the big blind you've net you've seen him call up to 8 X before he's never folded what should you do if your Delta aces in that gentleman is in the big blind my friend Guillaume always brings this up and it's such a good point obviously most of us would raise to 8 X there even if the players around us would likely understand we have a good hand now for the next slide guys I'm going to use baseball analogies so my apologies to everyone who isn't from America or who has never been invaded by America but I truly do not know many other sports so everything is a baseball analogy with me it's also the most beautiful game in the world which is incredible for teaching game theory and exploitative play when coupled with database analysis so I'd recommend all poker players develop a passing interest in the sport anyway the scouting report imagine we have a scouting report that says this player cannot hit a curve to save their life if you were the pitcher in this game would you throw him a curve ball would you not throw him a curve ball because he possibly could have learned how to hit a curve ball no you throw the curve and if he showed you he could hit it then you would change his strategy look how difficult this would be to play guys like look at this from this guy's angle right if he has a hand that he could defend with I have used this move in the Bahamas Eastern Europe Canada in the United States I can count on one hand the number of guys who the 3 bat Bluff here also the big blind player there with 27 big blinds is supposed to shove his ace rags but most of them in practice even Flay even flat ace Jack now on the Internet people will know to shove or 3bet especially if you were dumb enough to make youtube videos about this edge the live many guys still associate that big preflop raise with quote old man coffee guys grinding it out with 8 8 plus an ace queen plus and that's tremendous now let's say you are in a different stage of the tournament so get a good look at this alright and the stacks are actually appropriate for a player to 3bet you because now we're a little deeper here now let's say the stacks are actually appropriate for a player 2 3 bet you regardless of what you put out there what should you look for in a live tournament have you ever done this have you ever looked at your hand before it was your turn to act and you saw that you had aces what did you do at that point did you shout hey come on actions on you to the guy it was on now most likely you were as quiet as a church mouse that tends to be most people's modality they're like the saber-tooth Tiger waiting in the bushes to pounce so if the button player is one of those guys who looks at his hands before it's his turn to act and he's doing anything ostentatious flipping through his phone looking at the basketball game looking exasperated then that generally is an indication he's not at the top of his range he might have ace queen but aces are unlikely it's something routine this was an actual hand I had in Baltimore effective stacks were about 50 big blinds where should I be looking here so it gets dealt to me I have King deuce of diamonds it gets folded to me on the high jack alright so we're going a little beyond cut off there you should start with the cut off to start stealing buttons but you can even take it out to highjack alright or should I be looking here 9 out of 10 times the small blind and big blind can't 3bet enough so you're looking at these guys dealer in cut-off and you should be watching them from the beginning of a tournament the two guys you're laughs like the others having obviously pay passing interest but the two guys to your left do you really want to have an eye on right when they slide their ID see where they're from I know some players that like to make buddy-buddy with the people on the left eye I've never been able to do that but it's not a bad idea you just want to know what's uh I was playing WSOP see Baltimore and I kept getting this open right here on the hijack it was like having three buttons it was incredible I loved it these two dorks kept looking at the 76ers playoff game whenever they didn't have much but they tried to look disinterested upon the action when they wanted to play oh my god it was glorious you earn these buttons by paying attention this is why it's ridiculous when you see guys on their cell phone the whole time are playing on their iPad that is just indication that you cannot play now let's discuss two more situations that come up often all right take a look at this situation for a few seconds okay that's about all you get usually if you wait for your turn to act what should you do here I'll give you about 10 seconds here so what do you guys have we got a 3x we got a few folds we have a lot of people guessing D and F e Footwear I love it when everybody's all over the place I like making my quizzes tough if the practice should be tough that way you can have more fun while you're playing like practice should be tough actual playing should be a joint what's that phrase the more you bleed in peacetime the less you'll bleed in war to get morbid I think in my opinion this is a 2.5 X the reason for that I hope people were noticing the these stack sizes changed dealer and cut off you had to redeem stacks to your left if they have picked a hand to go all-in with typically your size is not going to dissuade them in any way you can even get away with 2x here but I prefer 2.5 because it tends to shake the small blind just a bit more and get me more pots with the big blind now let's say the button has more chips but we still have that short stacked cutoff we also know the button is a relaxed guy who doesn't three that much you know the type happy-go-lucky type happy to see flops so now the button has 43 acts right we we open and dealer calls and big blind calls so let's say we open here because we think this lane is open and we're wrong the dealer was actually watching the footy but he has something mediocre apparently because he's cold calling ones button calls the big blind never fold so we should be prepared for this this happens all the time now you get this bored Queen of Hearts six of Hearts five of diamonds four point eight K in the middle it has been checked to you what is your move take your time with this one and if you don't know what to do here I'm going to point out that you are in this situation no less than 200 times the session so we have some a get few people are guessing a few people are guessing see a few people are guessing B I love I love it when it's all over the board I'll let you guys make your own decision but I'll tell you what I like to do here a lot of people saying C a lot of people well here's the thing guys this this in my mind is it Shaq and let me tell you why that is okay the way you figure this out is by multiplying their folding ranges together so button is off in cold-calling maybe 12 to 15 percent of the hands let's start with a tighter range if we can Bluff this one then we can Bluff all of them on this range he's defending 65.5% of hands which means he's folding 34.5 percent of the time okay then we'll do the big blind calling range obviously much wider here you'll notice he's defending forty five point eight percent of the time which means he's folding fifty four point two percent of the time right so point three four five times 0.5 to you're going to get both people folding about eighteen percent of the time there and let me let me say there you can play with those ranges quite a bit but let's say both of them if both of them were playing wider ranges it missing half the time age which tends to be about pretty typical they're both missing together only 25% of the time okay so let's say they both have like really wide ranges and both players in this fifty percent of the time well you have to to find out how often both of them miss it's going to be about it's only gonna be a 25 percent around there now caveat emptor the one thing I don't like about this method is it assumes the two calling ranges are independent of each other technically if button calls it probably widens the big blinds calling range but it's a good thought experiment if both players are defending draws in pairs which I honestly think is pretty close to accurate then oftentimes if that button is tighter then they're both folding less than two times out of ten and yeah it tends to be the best you're gonna get with super wide calling ranges is maybe like thirty percent so the two options I really want you guys thinking if you want a bet here with a backdoor flush show or something like that is one-third pot because one-third pot needs to work about 25 percent of the time but both players missing the board is not going to happen that often so it's really hard to squeeze that in there and unless you have like a really defined betting strategy on turn and River I'd really warn against larger bets if you're trying to set something out the larger bets can be justified but you do after really what you're up to now when do you want to bluff that multi-way you want there to only be two other players three or more is extremely difficult you want wider cold callers in position and out of the big blind you want to board with only one card over nine or none at all in that card can't be an ace you don't want multiple draws on that board and if you have backdoor draws that would be preferred okay so reviewing what we learned today multi way pots suck because it's difficult to bluffing them if we are facing 25 to 40 big blind stacks we can often buy the button with a larger than 3x raise when we're on the cutoff if we are facing short sax however there is an array size that will really dissuade them so we should go back to normal race sizes and that also works with really big stacks as well now earning two to three buttons in orbit is the nectar of winning poker because the big blind is the worst player at the table and the button gets to play with the big blind the most often so most of this lecture I just really wanted to focus on how we can just take that button for our own that's mostly gonna happen from the cutoff but you should broaden it out to the hijack that's why I brought that in as well because it didn't make sense to also just have a lecture just for the hijack so because it would be mostly the same topic so I tried to put those together anyways guys I hope you really enjoyed this thank you for tuning in today and if you wouldn't mind do you mind if I tell you about a deal we have going on is that Alright typo one in the chat if that's alright or in the questions we have lots of ones awesome I will get right to it if

[Document(page_content="this all set up no you're not supposed to be able to see my webcam I might have popped up for a second the webcam is still on oh well you guys gotta see me for a second now I turn it off cool all right I'm not too pretty in the morning so all right here no this is not a replay from a few weeks ago but this is gonna be a continuation of the webinar from a couple weeks ago if you guys have not done so as I've mentioned in the tweet yesterday we are doing a straight continuation of last week's webinar last week we looked at range compositions from the flop that's why you're asking I forgot to change the title of this is this is a turn range composition and today is June 5th not May 25th so this is a continuation the first few slides are the same so the first few slides are the same and then we're gonna work into the turn and we're gonna use one of my favorite programs piyo solver to look at some of the turn spots and we're gonna look at some different current hands so it is a 9 a.m. now we got a lot of stuff to get to hopefully everyone is having a good world series or some of you some of you guys out in Vegas right now today on the schedule I have the WSOP $1500 six max event six max event is at 4:00 p.m. today let me fix this really quick yeah so that's the what's on the schedule today like the big 50 a couple times cashed it but did not make day three so well we're about even on the series so far so alright looks like we have one hundred and twelve people let's get started we got a lot of stuff to get through today so today we will be looking at turn range compositions we'll be looking at the same example from the last webinar King of Diamonds eight of clubs for clubs middle position first big blind flop and the main questions we're going to be looking is how to equity shift on various turn cards so last week we looked at the equities on this King 84 flop rangerous range will we will do gonna do a quick five minute review and then we're gonna move into the turn stuff and what we're looking at is how those equities shift when different turn cards come out and then how do you arrange compositions shift on there's turn cards remember we're not concerned with the number of combos but we're more concerned with the percentage of the range that certain categories of hands fall into so we will be looking at that and we're going to look at how our turn strategies are affected by these shifts and equity and the range composition Laura yes the first replay is posted on YouTube if you go on my Twitter I posted a link to it yesterday go on twitter to McMurdo poker MC Matto P okay ER or on poker coaching comm Twitter they have the replay and then this replay reposted you can go back and re-watch both of them so as a refresher this is the setup that we had from the first webinar middle position raises to two and a half big blinds big blind defense these are the ranges in position range about 18% out of position range we just have them buddy three betting Queens kings and aces ace king pure just those are never gonna be in his range sometimes no 3bet jacks sometimes a 3-bit tens and then he's gonna have various three bit Bluffs but they really just don't change the composition of the range is too much and it's just easier to do the range like this and we're gonna be looking at a ten to one SPR so a ten to one stack to pot ratio so we're looking at around like a sixty to seventy big blind starting stack so I'll show you the setup that I used in piosolver is the microphone loud enough I just want to double check all right looks like I got some all right perfect someone's is there any sound like you're Peters turned in 95% it looks like a lot of people are saying the sound is good so yeah perfect thank you guys so this was our flop analysis from last webinar we got the two ranges plugged in here and the imposition had a 61% range advantage to 61 thirty-eight it's a pretty significant range advantage this program right here is equal AB which you can download for free and it's an equity calculator we could put in these two ranges what will be seen today is piosolver a little more advanced version of this but everything I'm doing you can pretty much do an equal AB and C the ranges and so if you don't want to spend the money on piyo silver or whatever you don't really need to I just like the program so I'm doing that a little review here's the flop and this is the range composition so we got the middle position range here and the key points to take away here where middle position had a big set advantage even though he only has three more commas Ahmet he has four times as many sets as the imposition player as a proportion of his range so he is a set four percent of the time which is only one percent Adam in position and then he has a you know the over pairs and the big part was top pair he has top pair 19 percent of the time so over twice as much almost twice as much as the big blind and then the under para is where the other big range advantage comes from he has 11 percent under fairs so the under pairs would be nine cents Jack's queens so between eights and Kings versus the under pairs only make up 3% so in position has 30 percent hands better than a pair of eight versus only 13% 14% for the out of position and that's basically because the big blonde is defending all this junkie suited stuff because of the price they're getting he's supposed to defend it and that is why sexually range advantage the big blind has ace high or nothing over 60% of the time versus this tiger range here in position the middle I'll always be referring to MP as the in position player has ace high or nothing around 48 percent of the time and we can go ahead and we'll look up here is the simulation on piyo for this hand I'll just go through this really quick because I want to show something on the flop we got the out of position range here same as that I showed you before in position range stock to pot ratio basically effective sex 110 and then various bet sizes kind of just made this as simple simple various bet sizes etc and what I wanted to show you was the equities and if you look at these the coloring here this is the imposition equities the darker green is the higher percent at highest higher percentage of equity the hand has so like for example pocket kings here has 90 almost 95 percent equity against the big blinds range all these kings have you know over eighty percent equity and then as you get into the yellows Theo these are closer to 50% equity hands so like for example as you can see over here ace 9 of Spades has about 43 percent equity ace nine hearts 43 and the one thing I want to show you just for why the imposition has such a big equity there so let's look at the lowest equity hands and the lowest equity hand here for is probably gonna be is the nine ten of Spades in the nine ten of hearts so as you can see in the bottom right here the grade nine ten of spades and nine ten and hearts each have about twenty eight percent equity against the big blinds range so twenty eight percent that's his basically his worst hand for the imposition player and the nine ten still has you know two overs to the eight in back door straight draws and then if we look at the out of position you're gonna see a big thing so look at the imposition lots of green some yellow and pretty much no orange or red which would be the lowest equity hands you can see the grid right here where my mouse is green one hundred-percent red zero percent when I flip it you're gonna see a big difference this is the big blinds range and he has some green and all his green is basically these top pairs king/queen all his pair of kings and just look at all this red that he has just so much he has so many low equity hands in like nine deuce of spades has eleven percent equity nine six of Spades has fourteen percent you know six deuce of spades 13% ace five off all these ace five combos have like under thirty percent equity so the key point I'm trying to say is big blind has a lot of garbage in position doesn't have much garbage and that leads to that 61 percent range advantage that MP has that we referred to last week so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna look at four different turn cards so we have this King eight four board with two clubs and we're gonna look at four different turn cards so we're gonna look at a complete brick so the deuce of spades we're gonna look at a pair card and well first actually we're gonna look at the low flush completer so the three of clubs the high flush completer the ace of clubs we're gonna look at the pairing cards so when the like an eight comes and it pairs the board and we're gonna look at the straight completer there should be an R there the straight completer so the seven hearts when the gut shot straight draw guts there on the flop what we're gonna do on each card is talk about how the equities change in how range compositions change on each card and we'll be using the range Explorer on each card just to see how the range is the range compositions change and this will kind of also serve as a slight introduction on effective use of Payoh solver and how you can use it in kind of a non-technical way to learn these range compositions and equities and there will be some participation on each card before I show you the slide and before we look into it I'll be asking you how you think the equities are gonna change how the range compositions have changed so I want you guys when I ask that go ahead and pop your answers in the chat check your answers and if you're watching this on the replay you know pause before I could go onto the next side when I asked the question go ahead and pause it take a minute or two think about how you think the equities are gonna change and try to you know check your work see where you're wrong why you were wrong or if you got it right excuse me so flop plays pretty simple like it's a lot easier to find equities on the flop and then on the turn it gets it's a lot Messier so this might get a little complicated it might you know stick with it and the key part here is just still I know different turn cards affect the range interaction first though we're gonna do a quick you know we're gonna set up this flop the flop scenario so just so we know what the ranges are going into the turn so we need to know what the ranges are going into the term before we before we continue so we talked about this last time King eight for this is kind of the basic piosolver setup and the key thing here is this is the strategy that it's suggesting this is out of player position player first first thing I want to point out there's no leading from out of position says 1% but I only solve this to like 1% accuracy if I ran it all the way to 0% where it solves it completely this would go to zero and it would be a hundred percent check why is out of position 100 percent check we talked about this last time because out of position only has 38 percent equity he's at a big range disadvantage so out of position is always going to check to the imposition player and never choose to bet and we talked about this last time as well once out of position checks this is imposition strategy in position is gonna bet every single hand as range same scenario it says we're gonna check three percent of the time basically if I ran this down to zero percent it would have us bet a hundred percent of the time and yeah Mike that's why I'm setting this up we're gonna owe for all the examples we're going throughout the term we're assuming it's gonna go check in position bets and big blind calls and so we're gonna be looking at the ranges so key thing here is going into the turn so after the flop going in and turn in position has every single hand still so Harris it we don't really have a here in a villain because we're gonna be looking at both players in this range we're looking at this as an outsider basically so we don't really have hero in a villain just out of position in position so keep key takeaway one is that in position player is gonna have every single hand here on this grid going into the turn because he's betting a hundred percent of his hands for three big blinds there's ten big blinds in the pot so 30% bet and the reason he's betting small is just because he has a huge range advantage and he wants to bet every single hand in his range so we're gonna do the bet and then we're just gonna look quickly at what the big blind strategy is so we have an idea of what his range is going to the turn a couple of things to point out first let's look at what types of hands the big blind is raising so he's raising about twelve percent of the time so let's look at his nutty hands he doesn't have pocket Kings pocket eights he's raising a hundred percent of the time so he never has pockets going to the turn there's about a sliver of it but like I said if I ran this to a hundred percent it pretty much always raised the eight pocket fours always raising so this orange color is always raised the green color is called and the blue color is fold so pocket fours and pocket eights his sets are always raising that is very important now let's look at his two pairs King ain't suited pretty much always raising the two combos our King exuding there's a sliver of colouring it probably if I ran it to 100% completion it would always raise it never call Kate off suit same thing pretty much always raising its top two pair combinations King four suited that's where it kind of starts to not raise and it's just gonna call with the King for suit in so King four suited is gonna be one of the two pairs in the range of the big blind going to the turn and then the eight four suited the eighth for suited is always going to be raised and the reason it's going to call with King eight suit King four suited and just raise the eight for certain because it always wants to raise the eight four suited because it doesn't block a king and so it's more likely in position has a king that can call with and then with King four suited it kind of blocks some of the column range and it gives it a stronger hand to call with so and then it's gonna raise some races King Queen a very fractional you know small percentage of the time that he raises some of his top pair combinations so key takeaway number one for the the key takeaway number one and the reason it's raising King suit is just as strong enough to stock off against over pairs in other Kings and it doesn't have to worry about getting counterfeited with the case either the King for suited it's a little worried about putting a ton of money because there are some cards that can counterfeit it with the eight and then also pocket eights is one of the stronger hands in in positions range so key takeaway number one and this is a big mistake a lot of people make is they call with strong hands because they want to protect their range but as you can see here the computer simulation is pretty much always raising and fast playing at strong hands and it will protect itself on the turn because basically the big blind on the turn can have like a ton of two pair cards the you know straights and flushes and we'll use turn cards to protect itself so for example if a jack comes off you know the big blind they can have jack eight King 8 King Jack etc and so you don't really need to be sloped people slow play big hands way too much calling hands so pretty much we're calling with every King with our 8 pretty much always calling with an 8 unless it's 2 pair or the set with our forest again pretty much always calling with these fours doing a very small amount of raised bluffing with the smaller floors and then it won't be that important for this simulation well actually look at a lot of its flush draws Jack too so you see here like Jack deuce suited basically it's obviously folding in Jack deuce of spades diamonds and hearts and it's just calling with the clubs all these weak flush draws is just calling with and then once it starts to get like it over card to the 8th it sometimes starts raising it so this is an important part for the range here nut flush draw so east use of clubs raising a strip clubs raising H 5 of clubs raising a 6 a 7 of clubs raising and then once it gets like ace 9 because it has two overs to the 8th it has more equity it just starts calling with a lot of those flush draws but it's the big blind is just folding a lot of this aces that don't have a flush draw here so a 7 suited 6 5 8 3 ace deuce even a hand as strong as ace jack of spades or ace Jack of Hearts is just folding on the flop without a backdoor flush draw ace 10 only with the backdoor flush draw and then on the off suit one it needs like a diamond or a club to continue with ace jack so it's folding a lot of aces here so that's a key point here is that we're folding a lot of ACE high and too many people just continue with a size because they just don't have enough equity yeah like that's the general big burn strategy here so calling a lot of it spares Jack's tens nines some of these gutters so like eight seven off seven six off six five off it does a little bit of raising with some calling he's folding no flush draws some of them he's just raising some flush draws and calling some of them but he's never folding a flush draw kind of the cool couple of the cool Bluffs that the computer always has here this is one of the these are the savage Bluffs that most people don't ever find these are kind of the fun ones in look just look at how how high percentage that it's check raising these hands like the ace of clubs with either the seven six or the five so it has the nut flush blocker and a backdoor straight draw they're pretty much almost always raised key takeaway here twelve percent of the time most people do not most people do not check raise enough that's a key takeaway here what does pylos all those criteria to fold collar raise is it hand equity basically yes it's it's calling you wants to call raise with hands that have enough equity to raise with it wants to so if we look at the equity so it's raising with like these ninety percent equity hands eight for King for King eight eight for you know some king queen and then for Bluffs it wants for like the bluffs it wants two hands that have backdoor equity or very good blockers so for example this a seven doesn't have very good equity the ace of clubs seven of spades thirty percent but as very good blockers in terms as the ace of clubs so when the club comes it can Bluff they're not flush and then when like a five six or seven comes it can Bluff the straight and it turns some equity as well so it's a combination of hand equity and basically it's kind of just polarizing its range when it raises because uh it's just gonna start polarizing to these nut hands in its Bluffs yeah this is a middle position opening range king queen suited with the flush draw yeah it's raising kink waves basically just raising king queen suited with the flush draw and then some King Queen off when it has the king of clubs all right so we got a lot of stuff to get through and we only have a few there's probably be a little less Q&A cuz we have a lot of stuff to get through here so let's look at our first turn card here that was the flop we have a good idea of the flop strategy now so first the first turn card we're gonna look at is the deuce of spades now remember on the flop imposition had a 61% range advantage so I'm gonna ask this question now I want you guys to take a second post it in the chat on the deuce of spades turn after it goes check bet call so we bet the flop big blind calls and the juice of space comes out how have equities changed on the deuce of Spades turn card and then also start to think about you know we're more concerned about equities here so I want you guys to guess what the equities now range versus range we just went through kind of what the big blind range is we know imposition has every hand so how do equities change on the deuce of Spades turn card so we're looking at the King eight four and then the deuce of Spades turn card or complete brick so seventy thirty four imposition increase for middle position I see from someone another equity goes up for imposition down for out of position little change increase in position goes up slightly alright this is why it gets much more difficult to a little I haven't seen the correct answer what's so the out of position player on the deuce of Spades now has an equity advantage and the reason isn't that the deuce of spades change anything the deuce of spades is complete brick the reason that out of position has a range advantage now is he's folded all his junk on the flop and if we looked at the hands that he called with he called with all his kings all his eights all his force all his flush draws all his strongest ace highs so all he's left with our pairs and draws and what it out of his imposition has everything that he bet with on the flop so in position saw his Queen Jack Jack Ted etc so now the outer position player on the deuce of Spades has a 52 percent equity advantage in position has a 48 percent so now let's look at the range composition here so on the right on the top we have the out of position player and on the bottom we have the imposition player now this is how we can take a look at this in position has a set 4 percent of the time out of position 1 percent of the time so that's still the same in the out of position basically never has a set now other than deuces so picked up two and a half combos reduces it peel it called with deuces with the deuce of clubs so that's that's where the set comes in to pair he only has six combos of two pair because he check-raise most of his two pairs remember he check raise with King eight and eight for the only two parry picked up was like King deuce suited eight deuce suited for do student so he picked up some of his this is his range after we went check bet call and the deuce of Spades came out so this isn't before the turn card it's after the turn card and there but here's the key part remember when we first looked at this out of position had pair 10% of the time right he had 11% top pair and 9% second pair and 3% so look at this between second pair and under pair he had 21% here now after the deuce of Spades comes out he went from 21% to now out of position has second pair 17 percent of the time and under pair 7 percent of the time and 20 percent top pair so he now has an 8 or better 23 43 percent of the time plus he has these two pairs instantly so almost half of his range is gonna be a pair of eights or better now versus before it was like 15% so that's why out of position is made up that big equity advantage because he's just folded all that junk that he had before and that's what we're gonna Matt we're gonna look at different turn cards and you'll see how the equities effects on different turn cards so this is and this is probably - what you're getting at Matthew this is probably what the equities are gonna pretty much be after it goes check bet call before the turn card comes out that's why I did the brick first cuz the brick really doesn't change anything other than Brees in a couple of more - pair combos so to answer your question Matthew this is probably what the equities are gonna be pretty close to this after it goes check that call before the turn card comes out so basically out of position has picked up this massive thing there and then in positions range composition pretty much change the same because he bet everything on the flop so what does this do to the strategy now because the equities are much closer so we talked about this talks we talked about now that the equity is much closer in position just doesn't get a bet everything and we're gonna begin to polarize our betting range because the equities are much closer so there's pretty much give me no small betting we're only gonna be betting large and in position is basically gonna be still pushing the imposition still kind of as an advantage the imposition does have another advantage because he still has more sets his top pairs even though he has less stuff or about equal top pair he has stronger top pairs because he has ace king out of position doesn't have a king he is more king queen because out of position check raised some of his King Queens on the flop and the imposition player has more sets and two pairs because out of position started to check raise that so let's look really quickly here we get the bet two three call deuce of spades and as you can see because the out of position doesn't have the nut advantage he's still gonna always check he's always going to check because he doesn't have a nut advantage and the equities are still pretty close and he's out of position check and then this is the key takeaway here I didn't put an over bet into this simulation just because it I didn't want to have three sizings but we have a small size which is six the pot of 16 big blinds I gave it a 40% bet size which is six in an 80% bet size so six and thirteen 40% and 80% and as you can see here we're only basically using the 80% bet sizing and what does that mean we're polarizing our range so we're gonna be checking about 40% betting 60% and always using the 80% sizing on this brick turn card and basically we're betting an eight or better for value so ace a king 8 are stronger eights we check at nine eight but then nine Stein's Jack's Queens still bet a decent amount Kings aces ace king all four value all our kings most of our Kings are all still betting and then we start to mix in our Bluffs we're still betting like fours and then we start to to Bluff with some of our we so better flush draws we're bluffing the some of our flush draws bluffing with some of our good equity hands base I'm not gonna try to get in too much into the term bluffing we're mostly just getting into the betting strategy here in the the key takeaway here is that we're gonna polarize and never use a small sizing and always use the bigger sizing here on the turn and then as you'll see here will start bluffing with a lot of our ace highs because of some of the blockers we'll block a lot Bluff a lot with the ace of clubs bluffing bluffing they're strong blocking his strongest flush draws etc so just a quick thing basically we'll about thirteen and then big blind here's a key takeaway when we we start betting large here on the turn the out of position player is going to be folding a lot of air mate it makes it indifferent with his eight so when you see a mix here when it shows like for example a nine eight suited here it has it folding sometimes and calling sometimes when it's mixed here between fold and call that means it's basically zero evie and the big blind is indifferent between calling and folding so by polarizing our range on the turn to an eight or better a stronger eight or better we're basically forcing the big blind to be indifferent calling with his eights and he's basically only calling with like Kings are better and like his over pairs and his even like his queen three of clubs now our folding jack three clubs the strongest flush some of his weakest flush drills are starting to fold the turn now because they just don't have enough equity to continue and so yeah that's a basic overview we're gonna went through these a little quicker because we have four turn cards we want to get to but that's a basic overview of how the deuce of Spades plays so in summary equities are really close and we're gonna start polarizing on the turn so the next turn car we're gonna look at is the flush completers so we're gonna look at the flush completers now so the first one we're gonna look at is the ace of clubs so same question how do equities change on the ace of clubs turn card from the flop so who has the equity advantage and how big of an equity advantage do they think they have on the ace of clubs Mike yes the bet 13 is 13 big blinds I just set it up but everything in big blinds to make it easier alright some people say imposition equity ranges you know MP equity increases high flush completer out of position low flush completer in position in position as an advantage MP gets a boost alright so on the ace of clubs the imposition player gets a big range advantage on the ace of clubs so the out of position players equity on the ace of clubs is 43% and in position player has a 56% range advantage why is this we're gonna go to the top pair column this is why top pair out of position seven and a half percent so if you took a look on the flop when it went bet out of position is starting to fold a lot of these aces right he's folding a lot of his suited ace is anything that doesn't have a backdoor flush draw but in position bets every single suited ace in every ace 10 off or better so top pair seven and a half percent this is an ace now as top pair for the out of position top pair for the in position player 27% in position now has 27% a pair of aces are better and then he still has two pair sets and flushes so even though the out of position has more flushes and we talked about that we talked about that last time and out of position has a 13% flushes versus 5% for imposition it's just not enough to you overcome this 27% aces for imposition so imposition picks up a ton of aces huge range advantage and what is this strategy going to be I'll let you guys pick that what do you think the strategy is gonna be for the imposition player now given that he has a 56% range advantage what do you think the Reta strategy gonna be for imposition player on this ace of clubs after the big blind checks so we got check that call ace of clubs yeah in position double barrel is the only 100% still bets bet 60% pot okay so let's take a look at this so in position out of position does a little bit of leading on this ace of clubs we're not gonna really look into this too much but he has some flushes he's gonna do some reading so he checks and we are gonna be checking still a decent amount so some people were saying we do have a large equity advantage so you would think with a large equity advantage on this card we just get a bet you know 100 percent of the time or 80 percent of very high percentage of time and we do take one of the properties we are gonna be using the smaller sizing now because we have a large equity advantage our equity remember is 58% here so we don't really we don't want a polarizer range because we have a large equity advantage and we want to bet small the problem is though is this flush advantage is that out of position still has a really big net advantage on us he still has a 13% flush advantage on us and compared to our f5 yeah our 5% of flushes because most of our flushes are the ace high flush --is this is the key part here all our flushes are mostly the ace of clubs so that's why we're at a flush disadvantage here on this card and we just don't get a bet if we start betting 80% then big blind gets to start check raising a lot because he has a lot of flushes he has and he has a lot of like a say it off two pairs ace for two pairs not a lot of those but he just starts to get a check raised in his flushes and put a lot of money in the pot so we want to protect ourselves with some of these so these weaker aces are checking back like ace four through ace eight just because even ace king a little bit is gonna check back mostly when it doesn't have a club and it Sam because it just is really hard for it to face a check race so we have a lot of exactly Matt that's what that was that I don't know if I explained that well we can't have the nut flush which our most common flush is they're not flush but we can't have it because the ace of clubs is on the board so and we just don't have as many suited kings as we do suited aces so the reason we don't get to just bet everything is because we need to protect ourself a little bit from getting cheque raised okay in reality people don't check raised enough so you don't need to protect yourself I would always bet a sking ace queen ace Jack etc because people don't check raised enough and they're not gonna put a lot of pressure on you even though they have a flush advantage here so if you see like here we're betting like our queen i flushes jack no jack i flushes we're still betting our aces with like a club we're still betting some of these stronger aces etc but the key concept here is that we're using the smaller sizing because of our equity advantage and we're using the smaller sizing but we're gonna start checking back more because of that nut advantage that the big blind house so this is an example of having an equity advantage but not have an Internet advantage so there's two like those are two big properties not advantage and equity advantage and that's kind of gonna be the theme of it and some people are asking why is it betting these smaller pairs and it's using these to start to Bluff with so in position is imposition bluffing at all yes Doug in position starting to bluff it a lot and it's starting to use these small pairs with a club so like pocket fives with the club pocket sixes with the club these are gonna be a lot of it's like triple barrel Bluffs and percentage of the pot it's betting about 40% of the pot here so it's always using the bets and not the the bet 13 and yes we're always betting our sets pocket eights pocket fours it is checking some of the bigger sets aces and Kings just as there's not as many hands that can call its betting kings with the club but yeah what do you think the ratio of value to Bluffs are the reason that the ratio is just it's gonna you're always gonna have a some more bluffs than you are calls yeah alright so here's a key concept you're always gonna be bluffing more than your value betting be cut on earlier streets and the reason it's Oh on the flop you're gonna Bluff the most so as we saw on the flop we bet a hundred percent of our hands and the reason you want to Bluff the most on the flop is that on the turn in the river your some of your Bluffs are gonna turn into value hands so when some of your Bluffs turn into value hands now you have less Bluffs for later streets so now on the turn we want to still have more bluffs than value hands and because some of our Bluffs now so for example a lot of our Bluffs here are gonna contain a club like the five of clubs pocket fives at the fiber clubs pocket six with the six of clubs pocket sevens and seven of clubs we're starting to Bluff those hands and but those hands are gonna turn into a flush on some rivers right and then we're just gonna check those back because now we have showdown value so that's why it's starting to Bluff some of these pocket sevens with the no Club pocket sixes and with no club pocket fives and no Club because you want to be bluffing more on the turn because now when a club comes on the river you knew you weren't you're gonna have some not you need some non club hands that you want to Bluff the river with so the reason it's bluffing say pocket sevens here with betting pocket sevens with no Club is that when a club comes out let's say we bet he calls and let's say the queen of clubs comes out and he goes check look at now he's starting to Bluff here with the seven of Spades seven a nine and seven all right seven a diamond some of the time so that's just like one example that's not really what we're getting into in this webinar but but yeah so you want to have enough Bluffs so that you can have blossom later streets with some of your bluffs turned into value I hope I'm explaining that well enough but we can answer that question more at the end of the webinar I really don't have a specific a specific like ratio that I use someone else why is it checking to pair it's interesting it's checking pure King eight and the reason that's like at the equity of King a it's still a high equity hand I think it's just using that as it can't face it check raise and with King eight it's blocking a lot of the calling range so a lot of the calling range to this bet is going to be either a king or an eight or flushes so if we when we bet we bet he's getting value from King eight but I think it's just concerned about like he's folding all his eights and only calling with a king so he's blocking some of his like calling range I guess sometimes it's hard to understand why I was doing some of this stuff but yeah that's the ace of clubs we're gonna move along here because we're running long here so ace of clubs we covered that let's look at the low flush completer now the three of clubs so how do equities change on the three of clubs turn card from the flop I see some answers on here we want to know how the equities what the equities look like on the 3a club's turn card see Doug saying imposition has a nut advantage but not a range advantage out of position equity goes up out of position equity goes up and Doug hit this perfect the imposition has a range advantage or sorry it if in possession has a nut advantage but out of position has the range advantage I believe that is gonna be correct so three of clubs yeah out of position goes to 53 percent equity in position 47 so this is similar to the deuce of spades the three of clubs is kind of a brick the three is a brick because it doesn't really complete a lot of two pairs etc doesn't bring any straights but it does bring the flush the club so out of position 53% forty seven percent so all the parishes stay the same basically out of positions top pair went from 10% to 20% the big thing that changed here is the flushes out of position has 11% flushes now in position has nine percent though so that's a key thing on the ace of clubs on the ace of clubs the in position player only had five percent flushes now on the three of clubs he has nine percent flushes and that's because now in position can have the nut flush so in position has top pair advantage in terms of he has stronger top pairs and he has a flush advantage in terms of he has stronger flushes now out of position has a few more flushes than them but in position has stronger flushes and so the in position player basically just has nothing a lot more that's where the range advantage comes from and out of position has nothing 21 percent of the time ace high or nothing in position has he's higher nothing 40% so in position still has nothing quite a bit now and we'll look at this three of clubs here's the equity 56:43 and again this is even though out of position has an equity advantage he's not leading very often here because he doesn't have a nut advantage in terms of he chuck raised a lot of this nut flush draws and in position has a lot stronger flushes and stronger top pairs and still has all the sets and two pairs so as a proportion imposition still has stronger hands even though our position has an equity advantage and here as you could kind of makes sense equities are closed so out of position once in position wants to start to polarize more if I had it do one bet size it would probably just choose to do the 13 I did to bet sizes to try to show on some of these examples bet small and bet big here you can see he's using both sizings but it's basically just using a mixed with there's no hands that really puts they prefer to use one size and or the other so in general you can just use like the big sizing and that will be fine and start to polarize your range here that would be my way to simply that would be my simple way to implement the strategy I'm not going to be like I'm gonna bet Jack tennis of spades small half the time and big half the time and check half the time or a third of the time each I'm just gonna bet big and or check here mostly and polarize my range and I'm polarizing because equities are close and that's what you want to do in the equity the advantages are close so as you can see in position has all these nut flushes stronger you know he has stronger top pairs Ace King ace Queen and one thing that I want to point out that pile of silver does that you really don't need to do in real life it's like for example [Music] let's find a good example for example like he's gonna check back Python was checking back 10 9 of clubs like half the time so how's it checking ten nine eight clubs forty two percent so flush in reality you don't need to check that back and the reason that it will check back these ten nine of clubs is because if it goes check check check and then let's say like a deuce of Hearts comes off that's the out of position players when we started doing some over Betty which really doesn't happen in real life and basically the out of position players gonna start to attack like a semi capped range because he doesn't have as many flushes that check back and the big blind still has a lot of flushes so that's why it's checking back some of these flushes but in reality you don't ever need to do that do you lower courage favor the outer position player or is it in a function of flop texture time the lower cards are just going to be neutral because they don't improve anyone like the three of clubs doesn't really improve anything in terms of like what we can look at here on the range explore the outer position like so he's making a look at his two pair she has two commas a two pair now King soon she should have King three suited he's gonna sink I don't know why three of clubs there we go so like the only thing that the three change was that out of position picked up some King three suited and some four three suit of two pairs that's the only thing that changed really on the like three it's kind of it's a brick but it just completes a lot of these flushes so yeah in general the imposition loses the range advantage in position now has a top power advantage and a flush advantage in terms of stronger flushes stronger top pairs and position just has a ton of a sigh flushes and the big blind check ray most of us a side flushes on the flop so we have two more to go through really quick and we're at 50 minutes so let's go through this again we'll go a little longer today that's fine straight completer on the seven of hearts so how do equities change on this seven hearts turn card from the flop Fred no it's not a break if it completes the flush but I was just referring to instead of the three of clubs it was the three of hearts I was referring to is it a brick in terms of does it change any two pair combinations or sets etc it's not like an ace that changes what top pair is or what straits you know come in it's it's it's obviously not a brick with the flush so seven hearts we have some benefits out of position out of position out of position has a range of manager because he has more load cards to make it straight so this is this seven hearts is gonna play a little bit like the the brick the out of position is should have a range advantage now but it's not because he has a lot of streets it's just because of the top pair advantage so straightening board card now the seven hearts out of position has gone to fifty five percent equity in position forty five percent but the key thing is here a couple people said it's the benefits the out of position player because he has straits but it really didn't because a street he has nine combos of streets it's only four percent of his range so it's not a large percentage of his range now a street it's this top pair that we've gone through on every on every example this has been the case he is top pair of twenty one percent of the time and second pair fourteen percent in under per seven percent so he is twenty one forty two percent top pair under pair second pair and that's not even including his sets and straights and out of position now has picked up some two pairs with the seven so those the main things that's changed here on the seven of hearts nothing's really changed for the imposition player seven of hearts I want to look at those two pairs so 13 combos with two pair now so now out of position has the King seven suit in eight seven soon in eight seven off suit seven four students so he picked up some more two pairs that in position does not have but again not doing a lot of leading we're doing a little bit of leading but not a lot and the reason we're not leading is because of that advantage that the the imposition player still has stronger top pairs and still has these sets that we don't have it's still the imposition player well the nut advantage for the out of position player he has the straights and a couple more two pairs it's just the the the top pairs for and position are much stronger than the out of position player so for example out of position has you know King deuce King freaking four verses in position has King eight as his worst top pair so and he saw his ace king he has the over pair of aces he still has a set of seven so the proportion of stronger hands is just really strong in the imposition of range that's why there's no leading and imposition as has been the kind of the theme in position starts to polarize again because he's that equity disadvantage so he's gonna be checking more 62% so keep in mind he's checking more than when he had the last example in position had 48 percent and he was betting checking like fifty percent of the time now he's checking sixty percent of time and always using the big sizing and polarizing so he's betting his two pairs sets over pairs checking hands like queens jacks and tens those aren't part of a polarized range no longer betting his like ace eight and then starting to bluff some like of these gunshots like a six and eight five and yeah so key takeaway here is that now in position is at an equity disadvantage and starts to polarizes range more and now we'll look at the last example before the summary and I think the summary will help get to all the points together I'm trying to make so this is the last point the paired board card the eight of diamonds how do equities change on the eight of diamonds turn card from the flop and this is an important one how does the range composition shift from the flop to the turn on the eight of diamonds turn card that pairs the board any guesses on this one you not advantage for imposition Ranger Vantage four out of position no change crushers of the range OB has more eights in his range right so he has more sets now favors oo peep so OB now has a slight range advantage fifty-two percent on the eight of diamonds but here's the big thing that changes on the eight of diamonds that hasn't changed on any of the other board cards cards we've looked at the out of position if we consider in eight the nuts the out of position player now has a huge nut advantage on the eight he has 20 percent trips and you'll see in the strategy because now he has the equity advantage of fifty-two percent and he has the nut advantage we're gonna see the big blind player start to lead a lot on this a two diamonds turn card and the big thing here is the out of position player has trips 12 percent of the time versus only three percent for the out of position or in position player and he still has that top pair advantage and second pair third pair now which is a pair of fours so he has an equity and a net advantage we can go ahead and look at that in here call the eight of diamonds and now you can see it's still not like a huge leading range but he has a 22 percent leading range here and he's reading leading a lot of eights you know he's mixing kind of between checking and betting but a lot of these eights are starting to mix now and then it's between bet and check and also he can start betting some of this he's betting some of his stronger Kings for value because he's protected because he has a lot of he could start leading a lot of these like stronger top pairs because he's protected with a lot of a decks in his range and then he'll start leading some of this flush draws like he's leading some of these weaker flush draws now that can't check call so that's kind of the general strategy here let's look at the check and again acid in the theme equity disadvantage out of his position player is going to he's still betting 40% of the time and he's mostly start polarizing his range again because equities run close saris polarizing he's spending a lot of his ace polarize doesn't necessarily mean you can't bet you can only bet with an eight he's betting the king queen for a polarizing sizing King Jack bets some of the time so stronger Kings basically a stronger king or better or starting to bet for the imposition player is he leaving his counterfeited two pairs King four I would guess no I don't think he he's leaving a few of them as blockers he's leading some of these but he's not leading them any more than he's leading some of its like King Jack and stuff so so to wrap up and we'll do a little bit of Q&A since some of this was complicated stuff we're at an hour this is might be the most important slide this next one the summary so looking back in you this is probably a webinar you'll want to re-watch a couple of times this is pretty complicated stuff pretty high-end stuff but good continuation and this is kind of what a lot of high end players are thinking about in summary these are the key takeaways equity and not advantage or what allow betting frequencies and sizings so equity how much equity arranged has as we've seen when you have more equity you get a bit more often we've seen that in the four examples and not advantage as well so it's not just equity there was the example on the ace of clubs on the ace of clubs the imposition had a 50 like 7% equity advantage but big blind had so many flushes and the the imposition just doesn't get to start betting everything because he doesn't have as many flushes as the big blind so equity and net advantage combined or would allow betting frequencies and sizings so that's point number one that's probably that's basically the main takeaway of this webinar the equity and nut advantage and that advantage basically is the range composition and how often you have really strong hands and how often you don't have really strong hands and then equity is just kind of the makeup of your whole range composition of your range is very important it's not just how many combos but it's the percentage of the range so for example on the seven hearts the straight completer the big wine has straights but it's only like three percent of his range so it's not really a huge deal so a lot of people justify decisions like well he has straits and I don't but the Strait is such a small percentage of his range that it doesn't make a huge a huge difference in the hand and then this is the second biggest point this is the second biggest takeaway the big blind often closes the equity gaps quickly from the flop to turn since he since he folds all of his junk on the flop so point number two big blind as in every example here got to basically even equity on the flop because he folded all his junk hands on the flop and point number three and you often see this and people don't know why we know why we use the small flop sizes now we use the small flop sizing because we have such a large equity advantage and not advantage on the flop at least on this board texture and then we use big polar turn size means after it goes to check call because now equities are much closer after the big blinds check called so that's the reason for we're using like a 30% sizing on the flop and then on a lot of the examples we started using that 80% polar sizing and if I put it in the simulation if I put an over bet of like a hundred and twenty percent like a forty percent eighty percent one hundred and twenty percent the pile so we'll probably start using like the hundred one hundred and twenty percent over a bet sizing a lot on the turn as well so three kick takeaways I want you to take away equity and not advantage or would allow the betting frequencies in sizings the big blind often closes the equity gap quickly from the flop to the term so I think you guys kind of learned that on the first example everyone said the imposition player had the equity advantage but then you guys quickly figured out examples that they were very close and then this all allows for the small flop sizing on the flop because of our equity advantage and big polar turn sizes so we made it through it this is very complicated stuff I know this is pretty high-end stuff pretty complicated so we're at an hour in two minutes I'm gonna do 10 minutes of Q&A and then we'll wrap this up so we'll go 10 minutes longer so let's fire in some of these Q&A I'm gonna start from the top so yeah butts I'm gonna go through the top and then keep filing to some questions and I'll try I'm gonna kind of go rapid-fire through some of these questions so earlier real fast is over but still strong on in position player after it goes bet call yeah so this is kind of here what I was talking about these big toy polar sizings I only did a 40% to 80% turn sizing but if I had to add it a hundred and twenty percent sizing or one hundred and fifty percent for in position player it would be used on those brick cards we're in position wants to be polarizing likely an over bet would be used a lot on the turn Bluff to value ratio we talked to that a little bit you're gonna have more Bluffs than value because some of your Bluffs are gonna turn into value on later streets so you need to have a lot of Bluffs more on the flop less on the turn and then less on the river but you're gonna have a most people don't Bluff nearly enough Jason I saw this year asking why did it bet five five but not six six I don't remember what exactly and it was the reason it's certain about fives and sixes was just it's gonna it's gonna betting some of them to turn them into Bluffs on a later street and fives are just weaker than sixes and have less showdown value because sixes can beat fives and fives didn't really beat any pairs because the pair below it was a four on the board so when you see it start to bluff with pairs when you Bluff with pocket pairs you just want to start picking your smallest pocket pairs to bluff with clear out a lot of these comments and answers from earlier a lot of the lot of the bluff to value ratios we've covered that so Michael ass overall big one were to call preflop with a tighter range with a two and a half ex open wouldn't this increases equity range across these hands yes a hundred percent and you would see this when like someone flats in position they normally have a pretty big equity advantage on the out of position on player thank you Jason for the compliment how many hours a month do you study this complicated stuff um right now during the World Series not much at all but in general like I'll spend like five to ten hours a week so basically what I'll do is I can run a script with piosolver so let's say I take this same situation middle position versus big blind and I can just let it run for like a day on my computer it might take like 12 hours I can have it run like 64 different flops and then I can kind of have all of them and I'll export it to a spreadsheet which you can do in the program and it will give me like the frequencies on every flop and what I'll do is kind of use it like flashcards we're on different textures I'll kind of guess what my equity is on different textures and what frequencies I'm using and then when there's like ones that I don't know I can pull up the simulation and kind of look into it how I've looked into it look at the range explore see why we're doing things that we're doing and this is kind of the basic way that I think is really good to use pilo solver to in an effective way not to just cookie-cutter copy the strategy I'm not trying to do that more so you're learning why why is it doing things that it does what factors would you consider for deciding between 80% in versus 1 20% polarising good question benjamin stack depth is the main thing so as stacks are deeper my polar sizings are gonna be a lot bigger and as stacks your shallower your polar sizing for example if you're playing big blinds deep a polar sizing might be 50% pot because there's not much to play but when you're playing like 150 big blinds deep you're polar size you might want to be like 150 percent Rick Ricardo how how are the reeds that you have on players come into this when you know a player's sticky or Bluff e or tight blind defender etc these Trump everything this what we're looking at here is like theory stuff so this is studying theory and what we're trying to learn here is identifying when we have an equity advantage when we have a nut advantage and in general what type of sizings we want to use and like what are kind of general strategies should be on those boards I'm not trying to cookie-cutter copy the strategy that pyro solver does what I'm trying to do is understand range interaction and the composition of ranges so the big takeaway here is now is when the big blank check calls he has something now a lot you know it that's the big takeaway here and that you just don't get a bombs away now on every turn and River so and that you see some players do that and that's why you should start to polarize now I now the big takeaway here is I know like I should be polarizing a lot or realizing like for example on the ace of clubs why I don't want to polarize and I use the smaller sizing so the ace of clubs I think was the only card that we looked at that we don't use the polarizing sizing on so that's the type of stuff that I'm trying to learn from this not should I bet Jack seven student of the time that's not what you should be taking away from this what you should be taking away from this is these three points the equity and net advantages so learning the range compositions learning how equities change on different cards to this one and then when to use smaller sizings or polar sizing so those are like three big takeaways", metadata={'source': 'gl4MpNxS_3M',

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assasin Otto doing another one of my lectures today's lecture is called barreling theory handling multiple streets let's get right into this in today's webinar you will learn how to handle turns and rivers you will learn why barreling can sometimes be a terrible idea you will learn what turns and rivers are great to bear along you will feel much more confident in your turn and River game obviously in only a short period of time I can't explain turn and River play in totality because that's akin to teaching someone how to play poker within 20 minutes that said if I show you some spots that come up hundreds of times a year I'm confident I can prepare you to play better poker and increase your win rate we're going to focus on in position pause today let's just get the fundamentals done I find most people struggle with even that now the best way to teach you these fundamentals is to just put you in those typical spots and see how you handle them then tell you what helps professionals in those same situations so in this hand you're playing about 50 big lines effective with the other players you raise with Ace of Spades six of clubs on the bottom the big blind calls the flop comes seven of diamonds four of Hearts nine of clubs the big blind checks to you you bet half pot the big blind calls the turn is the King of Hearts what would you like to do in this situation let's see what people answer in the chat so the chat is gonna be off screen because I don't want to obscure that I have a lot of people saying D a lot of people saying C or D a few people saying e yeah Ellen it says he and a few people saying a so let's go ahead and take a look at the answers all over the board now this one I am putting green text next to what I believe is most right when you play low to mid stakes tournaments so I think the majority of people watching this video play low to mid statements and what I mean by that is tournaments up to $1,000 in a live by an maybe up to a hundred dollars online I think generally betting house bottom betting two-thirds pot technically can be made to work but most of the time what you should be doing is trying to check and we'll discuss ye could possibly be correct as well so the problem on this turn card many people will say but isn't the king in my range many people protest here that's wonderful but most low to mid stakes opponents won't care the vast majority of research says that people hate consenting to losses analytics on any poker game in the world will show folding on the flop and then a lack of folding on turn in river so if you ever do track data of any poker game on earth one of the things you'll find is that people fold about fifty percent of the time on the flop on average which makes a lot of sense because if you look at a typical calling range it's going to have high cards about exactly fifty percent of the time so it seems like people like to fold high cards especially out of position that makes a lot of sense I know I don't like calling with high cards out of position it seems like most people won't want to do that but typically once people hit the call button on the button on a hit the call button on the flop online or just call in real life they really don't like to fold if you are interested in this topic I would read the undoing project it's written by the same person who wrote Moneyball it's about the men who wrote Thinking Fast and Slow another terrific book what is fascinating to me guys is not that people are logical but that they are systematically irrational look at this spot again what do you think he's folding on the turn what happens when you see bet heads up you generally fold the high cards 50% fold to see that tends to be the statistics you you see many people fast play their two pairs are better to avoid drawers coming in and to build a pot they call with their pairs it's usually a that matches a card on the board comm unit or close so pay attention to this next part guys because this helped me range much better when I started playing poker or once I started making real money playing poker and it took me a really long time to get because flop Zilla didn't exist when I started so we had to do this all by pen and paper so it's really neat that this is available now now let's say in this board he calls you on the flop with anything better than a gutshot so we put little blue filters next to everything we think is calling out of the preflop calling range that we ascribed here for him out of the big blind and then we click this red button to green now look at the top of the screen this is very neat what flop Zilla does you highlight the part of the range that you want to learn more about in up top here it'll show you the statistics about that look at the top of this screen you see the combinations his calling range is 261 combinations six of those are any pocket pair in this case eight it represents 2% of the range however you'll notice the top pair combinations are 72 combos out of 261 are 27.6% this is a huge ranging mistake that many people make in their head because they think what do I think he has well he has a nine or Anna's like pocket eights or something like that that sounds like two separate hands but the difference is 72 combos versus six right going back to that again so really what's far more likely because people tend to like to raise their two pairs to build upon people like to fold their high cards comm unit Oracle eyes what's very likely it when someone calls you on the flop especially out of position is they have a pair that matches one of the cards on the board especially if they called out of the big blind and they have a vast array of hands that could make pairs because there's so many disjointed combinations that love to complete raises out of the big blind the middle pair so is 45 combos out of 261 as you can see in this graphic that's 17.2% of the 261 combo cooked total so 117 combos out of 261 are pairs that magic card on the board that's without him fast playing any stats or two pairs or anything people miss this all the time when they're studying when you see that the flop and a guy calls you the majority of his hands are going to be pairs that match cards on the board that makes hand raiding that makes basic hand reading much more simple you should generally double barrel when you think his flop pairs are folding or if you think he's calling on the flop with high cards and folding the turn that happens a lot on low paired boards for example say the board is 5 to 5 people like to call with high cards on that board but then they'll fold the turn often but people are not calling with high cards as much on these low coordinated boards especially when we're blocking ace highs with our hand it's more unlikely that he's going to have an ace high and here's also if you guys were curious about what the weak pair looked like you can highlight that as well so that's why it's a very long answer to say that's why option II had merit that's the only bet that will probably fold sevens and knives I don't know about you but if I'm sitting there with 10 9 and somebody over bets the turn I'm not feeling terrific here so we're not sure it does that so honestly I probably should have put e into yellow right there but I did want to show that it's a better bet in my opinion than C or D and the other option is to bet see our DS amounts in then bet river if you think that we'll fold a seven or a nine but the vast majority of opponents in low to mid stakes will not fold those hands the average call on the river versus a triple barrel is 80% and a lot of the data I looked at from low to mid medium stakes which is really interesting because the there is there's a question of framing in the book the undoing project it's a neuro economic test that they do you'll recognize it as the Asian disease problem if you read that book and the number they come up with is 80 percent in a very similar scenario where people either out the gamble to win a larger amount or to consent to a certain loss it's very fascinating if you get into it but yeah versus good opponents if you triple barrel they're you're more likely to get a seven or a nine to fold you'll need to develop that triple barrel as you move up in stakes but you shouldn't be using it much now because you're really going to be playing Beethoven to a cow most of the time most people at low to medium stakes will not appreciate that so let's put you in another situation guys so sing now I'm going to change the hypothetical you know you now have Queen of Spades nine of diamonds you raise preflop to 2.5 X the big blind calls same stack sizes the board comes seven of diamonds four hearts nine of clubs you see that the flop he called the turn is the King of Hearts what would you like to do in this situation so few people saying 'hey some people saying see a couple people saying a to check I always know when I really put the test together in a way I like because I see answers all over the board a lot of seeing these few ease all right you guys curious which one it is you go ahead and dep there're um you you will you will need to balance versus better opponents eventually but right now i think you should play mode more or less exploitative lee which is most of the opponents you're gonna be playing against especially if you guys go to Vegas you're only going to get thirty to forty hands with most of your opponents just try to play his hand your hand is easy to play it's right there in front of you try to imagine his hand in what the average guy would do with it and you'll usually be okay so checking check checking does have merit on occasion when you're trying to defend your turn shocking range here I don't think you need to defend it as much in low to medium stakes because I think people call way too much on the turn in low to medium stakes so I think generally you should bet one third pot or half pot because most people will just auto call with any pair of vs. those bets it's only when you go beyond half pot that people start thinking in bending 1.5 X pot that would be really good if you'd already over bet perhaps but I wouldn't do it out the gate so maybe that shouldn't be read maybe that should be yellow so you bet 600 here into 1200 and our big blind calls the river is the tua clubs your move gentlemen and ladies what would you like to do so we have a couple couple B's and C's a lot of AIDS all over the board see I'm glad we're talking about this we need to get everybody on the same page let's see oh oh it is even down the middle every option except for you nobody wants to do it that's the one I think it low to medium stakes guys you can get away with a bat here betting 1/3 pot half pot I think when you deal with low to medium stakes opponents I am just flabbergasted when I study poker to see what people will call 1/3 pot or half pot with but you'll even see a four call on that river sometimes versus half pot which is just bizarre especially low to medium stakes players think let's be honest guys we want to play poker when we show up to the poker room we don't show up to fold so if there's a missed draw out there a lot of guys will find a way to call as long as you don't bet too much so a lot of guys will go jacked and made a double gutter on the turn 10:8 hat missed 5 6 missed so yeah of course I'm gonna call there with my fork if you go to 2/3 I actually I'm fine with that as well I think you're gambling a little bit to get more money which I really like my only worry is that tends to get the average player to start thinking I think D is fine too I don't think e we should be doing too much unless you have some history with a guy and checking checking isn't you should check if the guy knows you're capable of a thin value bat and knows what to do against it because people always say but what if they raise there is a bluff the truth though the only time you should check there is if this person is a very good player which at low-to-mid stakes which i think is what most of us are playing it or even you'll go to WP PS and a lot of guys don't have that gear right once you get to Vegas in LA you guys have that Europe they have that but a lot of the smaller WPTZ they want to have that but in general people people are terrible at bluffing rivers remember for people to get to that River they need to check call twice not many guys check call ace high so they can check all ace high on the turn in the hopes that they bet that you bet thinly on the rivers so they can check read people get to the river with miss draws in pairs as we discussed earlier mostly pairs it's so difficult to teach a guy to turn a seven into a bluff there it's harder to find in a database and usually the number of draws that turn themselves into Bluff first of all you can't count every draw as a bluff because that means this person Bluffs 100% of the time with all their miss draws it's very hard to know that about someone so but even if you did count every combo of Jack ten there and five six it would still be a very difficult Tommy to toric wise it's not a terrific call and most the time I do not believe you can count even half of them if you think of what percentage of people really turn those miss draws into a bluff and almost nobody turns a mediocre pair into a bluff they're like they should also research indicates people are horrendous at folding on rivers curiosity equity is a hell of a thing especially if they can mock their hand and not have to show anyone he is many garbage pairs there when he calls from the big blind with today's ranges every database on earth shows people folding their high cards on flops and having a hard time folding pairs on later streets take advantage of that new hypothetical you raise preflop 250 2.5 X the big blank calls the board comes out seven of hearts five of clubs four of hearts you have Queen of Spades nine of diamonds you see that flop big blind calls the turn is the six of diamonds the big blind checks to you what would you like to do all right we have a number of A's few people saying e so a lot of A's and B's [Music] 1 B 2 B's now somebody said attack his I'm gonna bring that up okay guys so someone said if I believe they're calling with high cards I fire there and that's actually a really good point that didn't make this lecture is there are guys that will call with just random ace highs on that board in which case that does change the ranging I think in general though people well we'll get into this in just a bit this is a board you generally can double barrel on the lone king over card from earlier isn't usually enough to scare someone off of a pair because people feel like they're giving up something when they flop a pair and they don't like doing that but for two a straight does spook a lot of people so I think one third pot probably won't do anything but how pot two-thirds pot 1.5 X pot I think you're pretty good on there's one hypothetical in which you should check will see if you guys know what it is let's say you bet six hundred here and you don't even think he's folding something's you think he hero calls with a seven let's say we see bet the flop and he calls with open-ended straight draw our batter he folds his bare high cards he slow plays all of his big hands which makes our double barrel worse and he somehow calls with a seven on a 7 6 5 4 board on the turn we'll assume he folds his mess flush draws well if he does that he's only defending 64 point two percent of the time on the turn our half Potsie bet needs to work 33 percent of the time he's folding 35 point eight percent of the time if he raises any sets two pairs are straights on the flop our turn that works more if he hates his seven and folds it works more guys what is the most important question on that board when you see about there and you're thinking about double-barreling this took me a long time to learn what do you think is the most important question to ask yourself on that board I didn't put a timer for this but give yourself a few seconds to think about it it's does the guy call with bear gut shots that adds a lot of combinations of straight on that term because it is so easy to make a gut shot - it's so easy for him down to combo with an aid in it right many regulars will not just call with ten eight offsuit no back door draw on a seven five four board but if you get a recreational guy playing against you you have to be careful you only want a double barrel against regs who want who know how to fold pairs and by the way guys when I say regs I don't mean that as in they're good players I just need their regularly there there's lots of guys that low-to-mid stakes poker who just show up everyday like it's their job and they do not make money in a lot of regs no you should probably fold high cards to receive that out of position if it doesn't have much working and a lot of them know okay I can't really call with a para on this turn if I don't really know what to do on the river those are the guys you're talking however if you see a guy never fooled a turn or River or just never fold in general that's a guy who likes to fold gunshots that's a guy who likes to call gunshots on the flop and that's a guy who doesn't like the full pairs on turn and river so anyways guys what we learned today one week continuation that somewhat coordinated boards people tend to fold their high cards the vast majority of their calling combinations are pairs that match community cards it's difficult to get people to fold pairs in low to mid stakes we need a horrible board run out or an opponent that is somewhat disciplined if our pair beats the vast majority of paired board combinations we should keep firing thank you guys for

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assassin Auto bag doing another webinar for Jonathan little today we're going to be discussing the 5:00 post law tricks you can use this is some unconventional wisdom but definitely really fun when you get into it so let's just go ahead what you will learn in today's webinar today I will show you some unconventional post law plays that I don't always get to teach I've used these in the field constantly to great effect I appreciate you guys being here today so I can get these ideas on paper so let's get you right in the action because that's gonna be really fun if you've never done a lesson with me before I'd recommend you have a pen and paper for notes so you can write down what your answer was and then compare it with my own answers in this hand here in the middle stages of a tournament you raise on the button with Ace of Diamonds ten of clubs the big one calls you he's been your typical reg willing to mix it up just a little bit the flop comes Jack of Diamonds five diamonds four spades the big blind checks to you here what would you like to do so I'm gonna go into the chat here see what everybody says oops my little timer so we got a few people saying see that a lot of people looking like they're liking that got a few people saying check a few people saying two-thirds pot and all right I'm just gonna cut that one short because I think a lot of you guys already know so time's up already know what you want to do they're technically any bet here should turn a profit that's why I'm not putting the red color on any of the options because all BCD Andy even turn a profit but with the Ace of Diamonds an ace high I like putting this hand in my checking range because there's a lot of turn cards that allowed me to call I I would typically lean toward that one if you're trying to be a little more careful versus opponents so you check here and the turn comes the tennis fades and the big blind leads out what do you want to do this one I'll give you full30 on so Bob in Florida says he would like to call yeah and we got a whole lot of calls Jeff said raise to 750 pretty much everybody is saying call here so I'm gonna give you guys about 15 more seconds there because my little timer is uh having some fun with the webinar software so we have a few calls all right so let's get into this this one's a really fun one guys so you can call a call is totally fine but another play that a lot of people never consider here that is really helpful is raising to nine hundred one person said raised to seven fifty I don't mind that as well uh I found this one player years ago when I was trying to study outliers in the data so what I was trying to do is I was just studying as many poker players as I can just professional players that were kind enough to open up with their hands that I can analyze with and I found one guy who is very successful and very unconventional that used to do this play a lot and when you analyze it it really makes a lot of sense now when I show this play to many people they seem aghast which means we're not thinking about everything we could possibly be thinking about when we play because think about it this way there's three categories of hands in most situations if you want to simplify things heads up there's two pair batter pairs in high cards whenever you're doing basic ranging and you're having a hard time visualizing your opponent's range you should just start with that now as far as us playing two pair of batter pairs are high cards when we play poker two pairs are better are easy to play and you tend to just play them fast and you usually get value there's very few players who can make high cards work for value that's why it's always on poker Twitter when a guy makes a big call with them it's such a rarity how you will play cares will make or break you and no-limit hold'em always think of a raise our bet first get in that habit if you just Auto call with cares or pot control there are times that can be okay but you'll never make as much money as you could possibly make versus low to medium stakes opponents who will let you get considerable value think of what he's leading out here so we check back on this flop of Jack of Diamonds five of diamonds forest guides so what you're looking at right now is flat Zillah I really love flop Sula because it's great for helping us visualize ranges because otherwise that's very difficult for the mind to do to put all these combinations together at once so we have our hand right here is underneath that cards and here is the flop and this is his wrench we suppose so we check back on this flop which means we keep in his entire preflop calling range you'll notice you have 54% equity versus his leading range here if he leads draws in second pairs which is pretty typical so what you're looking at here what I did is I put a blue filter next to everything I thought was leading and I didn't have him leading weak pairs but I did have him leaving middle pairs and the flush draws an open-ended straight draws and right here I click this button from red to green and that gives us a good idea of how much equity we have versus this range which would be 54% now I think that's a very conservative estimate because most guys lead any pair there and if he's leading any pair they're like many guys do after the flop the ghost check check you have 65% equity that doesn't even account for any Bluffs the other question I always want to ask my friends there when they call calling is fine but it puts you in a sticky situation I believe it's more profitable to raise especially versus basic competition or just low to mid stakes players if you're playing a $500 event in Vegas this will work really well $1,000 but if you were calling on that turn I always want to know what was your plan on the river a river 3:8 Queen King 9 diamond or spade was bad for you unless you're the best at staring at a guy and knowing if he has it you should raise here and get value while you can the vast majority of guys will just call with their drawers there if they raise again they they only have one card to come and they committed their 50 big line stack if they have a pair they'll convince themselves you have a draw and call to quote reevaluate on the river get your money now by the way if you're playing live and they check to you dark on the river that's usually not a draw draws want the option to lead the river if the guy leads the river it tends to be the joint he made his draw if he checks to you you have the option of firing again fourth in value - based on his turn call you still want this option if the river is a 10 or an ace that's why of the 5 close flop tricks you can use the first one is raised pairs on the turn to get money from weak leads alright guys let's do another one in this hand I'm gonna keep them coming fast today in this hand you raise 8 9 suited on the button you are playing a live $200 tournament in Vegas versus a nice guy in his mid 40s he calls out of the big blind this board comes out seven of Spades five of Spades four clubs he checks to you we bet the flop 300 into six thirty he calls pretty quickly and casually he shakes his wrist out after he puts in the call like his wrist is hurting the turn is the Queen of Hearts and he checks what would you like to do here so I'm gonna go into the chat see what people are thinking and gonna keep I'm gonna keep fire playing around with my clock here so we got a few people see we got a few people saying D few people saying be a lot of people saying hey we are all over the map here in the chat a few people are saying like I feel like he's gonna call again Douglas right says bet 1.5 X pot Bob says three four spot it's a fun one think of how many times you're in the spot right we should give it a lot of thought right now we'll think about this a lot like right here and then that will set us up for like the next three thousand times this will come up well an option a lot of people don't think about again this is another one of those situations in No Limit Hold'em work you can justify a lot of different actions but there's certain ones that seem to work really well and low to me medium stakes games if you check their because you go look this guy's got a seven or a five and he's not folding I think there's a lot of credibility for that a check here is fine betting the turn is good too but only if you're willing to triple barrel and many guys aren't willing to do that but the option many people don't consider is the over bet here on the turn guys when he calls you on the flop automatically there what does he have like what is the best hand he has that's another great thing to think about every time you see been a flop think about what is the best hand you could have he didn't need to think if he flopped a set there don't you think he would need to think about raising even if he had the nuts here he'd have to think about raising with the flush draw out there he probably would have three that 10 10 in higher preflop two pair if he had two pair on that board he would need to think about raising when he calls on that flop his range caps out at a pair of sevens maybe pocket eights could you imagine being in his spot with in checking here on the turn in a live tournament in a guy bets two thousand into twelve hundred how would you feel with 10 7 of diamonds here would you be thinking yes he bet 2 K into 1200 and I have 10 7 on a 7 5 4 Queen board and there's still one Street to play awesome most people what it I do this play a lot and I do it a lot with low to mid sixties what most people do is they yell at me and then they fold their five or something like that right if you don't like this play this over bet let me ask a couple of questions one have you ever done it I do this play a lot and it really works a lot of the time I fully met one time out of 10 I get caught right but that doesn't dissuade me from doing it the other 9 out of 10 times my first question is always have you ever done it because if I said I hate this book but I've never read it you think I was a crazy person but many people in poker don't even analyze a play before they poopoo it my second question what does he have to defend with there in order to not be getting exploited this is really interesting guys pay attention to this let's say he calls us with some straits and over pairs and he check raises his flush draws and he doesn't call with gut shots that is a lot of stipulations I'm giving this guy in his favor normally on that turn he's sitting holding his extremities with half the earth and got shots in his range but we'll give him this okay so if we bet two thousand into the turn that's even more than 1.5 X pot okay so we would be risking 2,000 win 30 180 because we do get back our bet when it succeeds if you think about it if you're flipping a coin in each of you are putting up 50 bucks you wouldn't do 50/50 because then it would just be 1 and you don't need to succeed at a coin flip a hundred percent of the time it would be fifty divided by a hundred so if we bet two thousand into the turn even more than 1.5 X the pot that then this bet needs to work 63 percent of the time which means he needs to call or raise or do something with 37% of the hands he called the flop with even if he calls on the turn with every single seven he's still not hitting 37% by the way if he calls if he just calls we get a free chance to hit an eight nine or six he's giving us more equity and if he calls them the flop with flush draws and gut shots he's folding on the turn seventy-two percent of the time even if he calls with every single seven so what you're seeing is I've isolated what he check called with on the flop and then I took it to the turn and we assume he's probably folding you know just as bear straight draws and flush draws on that turn and then even if he's defending with every single seven because so much is missed on that turn he's still folding seventy-two percent of the time in honestly when I do this play because I mean think about it you're in this spot guys it remember our bet only needed to work 62 percent of a time and it's likely working 72 percent of the time if he's only defending twenty eight percent of the time also imagine having nine seven of diamonds here guys in a Vegas tournament if somebody just bet twenty accent yo you probably would just if you figured it out good for you but I have a lot of people show me the hand after two minutes of thinking and they're just like fine take it you end up looking a little bit like an imbecile who's over playing their set who's really worried about a flush shirt which is great that's the exact image we want that's why of the five post flop tricks you can use number two is over bet the turn when you're a colony caps is range all right guys here we go we're gonna keep him common you're in a live tournament in Vegas a 1k the cutoff is a younger guy he's been very aggressive so far although you don't know a ton about him you call out of the big blind because you're not sure what to do vs. is for bet if you three bet and you think he's probably for betting often you want to give him a chance to hang himself the board comes Jacka diamond seven of clubs for clubs you check all on this flop to allow him to keep firing this turn comes out the two of hearts you check to him and he quickly bets 450 you call the river is the King of Hearts now here do you want to lead out do you want to check fold do you want to check call or do you want to check raise let's see your guys's answers so we have one we have one we have a lot of people saying see but few people save check raise some people say that Bob said that Mike C said shet call gonna give you a few sections a few a few of you had questions I'll be sure to answer that at the end all right everybody so what you should do is you should lead out here you should bet 1300 why lead there guys what did you think of this turn lead I want you guys looking for this because you'll see this a lot from grinding regulars okay I really pay attention to this next part because I started making way more money at No Limit Hold'em once I started being able to spot this what did you think of his turn lead think about it if you had a set wouldn't he be trying to get more value if he had a draw wouldn't he be betting more trying to get us to fold a seven or something like that what he's doing is what a lot of aggressive players do it's buying the show down unfortunately he's doing it to a player who can see through it and he's given away the strength of his hand through his sizing so in this guy's defense this play is gonna work versus most people because well 90% of the people in the chat didn't say lead-out so if he is trying to get a cheap showdown and get a little value out of 5 6 maybe some lesser pairs some flush rows and whatnot uh he's gonna get a showdown a really cheap showdown there it's a good play but I want you guys to be able to spot it so you can take advantage of that and the way a lot of them give it away if you just that's a normal amount here it's really hard to pick up on it unless you've seen the guy bet really thin on the turn before that's why you should always be taking notes when you play but if the guy under bets he really gives it away it's really hard to find a person who will do that with a set or a draw that's usually a pair that's trying to get to a showdown really cheaply so if you have something like ace jack which is beating almost all those pairs you you have to lead out there he and just so you guys can see this the ranging side he see that's likely a hundred percent of his range versus a big blank flat or that is reality most guys do that a little too much we did say he was aggressive not a pot controller and if that's the case when he bets that small on the turn he gives away that he has a pair that he's trying to get to showdown we have 74% equity against that range even if he's doing that with over pairs which he's usually not that King of Hearts is not likely to have helped our opponent we still have the best hand seven times out of ten if we lead he's likely to call wide because he can always justify it to himself as a mess flush draw or straight draw at a hero call with if this is a live tournament the guy doesn't even have to show his hand in his mind you're polarized you have just the absolute best hand or you have a lot of miss draws in aggressive players like this guy is really wants to play all the time so that'll make him want to call with all the Miss drawers out there so this looks really good for us they'll usually muck something like this that wanted to check back the river that's why the third of the five post flop tricks you can use is lead the river for value versus opponents who are trying to buy the showdown all right guys I'm gonna keep them going fast it's more fun that way let's start with something I see a lot of you guys doing just calling out of the big blind 50 big blinds deep when your opponent raises the cutoff and you're in the big blind okay so your opponent raises here in the COFF to 2.5 X you're about 50 X deep you don't really know what to do when you threw that any for bets so you just go ahead and call you tell me the guy is aggressive indecent so you don't want to deal with that when you three bets so let's go with that he's aggressive indecent let's play pretend we're playing against bad guy all right so we call here we get this awesome flop what is your plan of action you want to Donnelly chef called and check the turn you want to check called and lead the turn or do you want to check raise let's see those answers so we have all over the place can't even I love how active you guys are in the chat oops I mean get that timer going again we have a few people saying it is it is evenly distributed all across a lot of people saying see a lot of people saying be a few people saying these some people saying a-all right now okay so we're done there this is a really fun one I love this as a thought experiment because now that you're looking at all of them it's kind of crazy you pick B all the time right when I started playing I used to do be there all the time like shet call them check not really thinking like what is he bluffing most people when they see that that boar did you check the turn that got always got Mary's like okay I'm done now here's a better question I'll let you guys know every single one of these turns a profit obviously you have the deck hammered which one do you think makes the most money the one I found makes the most money on average I have actually tried this out a lot of different ways is the check raised check called lead works very well but people are getting a little weary to it I notice a lot of you guys pick that one that's a good option as well check I'll check I don't think gets as many Bluffs as maybe it used to back when people were a little bit more flippant about what they did donc lead does turn a profit the problem is that if the guy has like ten eight of diamonds you just lose that see that that you're most likely gonna get when you just completed from the big line so the one that tends to make the most money is the check raised every time I do this against an aggressive player they seem to have this one thought he wouldn't do that with amazed he's so polarized here so I get 600 more from eight 8 nine 9 ten 10 Jack Jack Queen Queen even though I lose them on the turn a lot but even though there's not much difference the aces in this guy's range seem to go broke a lot good players that I've never really seen make a mistake before will really overcome it here it blows my mind when I see people not wanting to put players in this spot now especially now when hero Colin has become so invoke and he can't know for a fact he's raising King 3 here King 3 suited there but for sure he's raising all of his suited aces in most likely most of his offsuit aces so the ace high board is a great board to play fast for value because he has so many hands you're gonna be making so much money from that's why the 4th post-flop trick you can use it's check raised ace high boards with the best kickers so alright guys we have one more I I tried to keep these a little quicker tonight because your time is very valuable to me and just want to keep it fun so in this hand you were at the beginning of a tournament a hundred big blinds you know nothing about any of the opponents yet you raise on the button the big blind calls you the board comes Ace of Hearts 2 of Hearts 3 of clubs it's check to you what is your bet so Jennifer says 1/3 Chad says 2/3 and we've got a couple E's most people are saying B or D Douglas says this is fine Alex all caps oh ok i mighta my timer is fighting with me a lot tonight because I'm reading your guys's chat ok so most people got their answer in this is a spot we all tend to play the same way but if you think of it's one of those spots we do automatically and we should really think about this a bit more because I think honestly the correct answer is e a the check check let's say you have a hyper aggressive opponent check can work if you think he's just gonna bluff his butt off on the turn in River but that's a very rare situation so I did a sign that a red designation obviously betting one third pot half pot two thirds pot does show a profit but I think three fourth spot is what you want as big as you can get this is one the GTO guys top man and it just makes perfect sense once you think of it the fun stuff about the GTO things in the solvers is sometimes are just any AI you bring into poker is sometimes the computer will say do this and you'll go why why does nobody do that and then you think about it for a while and it makes perfect sense you're obviously betting for value here right what hand is your opponent calling 300 with that he's not calling 550 with a flush draw will call you want all the aces to start paying you big and there's a ton of em his kin highs in Pocket sixes will still likely call you once based on how deep your stacks are if we're not betting big here we're just leaving money on the table now the funny question is people say so what do you do if you miss this flop to me this is the most exploitative life ever right because if you if you want to be balanced you have to pick one back here and go with it right so if you miss you should go big and you'll still turn a profit right and when you hit you should go big and or you can go really small but I honestly think if nobody knows who you are this guy in the big blind if he has like Queen seven of diamonds if you breathe on this pot he's folding and that's pretty much the only hands that are gonna fold king highs probably not folding to anything but anything below queen high is folding to anything so if you're betting trying to get a fold this is very exploitative and you cannot exploit others without becoming becoming exploitable yourself if nobody knows who you are I just bet a third pot if you mess this board assuming this is just the first hand but if I'd hit I would bet bigger now obviously as the game goes on you can't keep that up you should adapt a balanced strategy or if you want to play ball if you want to play money ball you can try to play rock-paper-scissors and outguess the guy just like major league pitchers do it's up to you neither is wrong both schools of thought can learn from each other there should not be this big war between the gto guys and the exploitative guys most of the gto practitioners will tell you that they use a lot of exploitative lines and the exploitative guys should learn vice-versa right so anyways guys recapping the five post-flop tricks you can use number one raise pairs on the turn to get money from weeklies number two over bet the turn when your opponent caps is range number three lead the river for value versus opponents who are trying to buy the showdown number four check raise ace high boards with the best kickers at number five bet bigger on ace high boards when you have the ace alright guys thank you for

really good question I actually find playing to be more fun but I find coaching to be more rewarding coaching is rewarding because it's a very it's very intense right like when you're giving somebody in a strategy that they're literally gonna put money on you really have to be right in that intensity I wouldn't say it's fun but it is really rewarding when you get it right ken says are you playing the WPT this week at parks I promised a buddy of mine I would go to his MMA fight so I can't go ah the code I just go to poker coaching comm slash assassin and it'll be right at the bottom Renee says Alex I've noticed that when I play thirty orbit levels let me hold on guys let me just in case they want me to record this well the master the flop package ever be available to poker coaching comm subscribers as a webinar are it's always gonna be a separate package that is something I created myself first Renee asked when I play 30 minute orbit levels verses 12 to 16 orbit levels I tend to go deeper in tournaments as mentors or is it strategic Renee you probably have more time to exercise your craft so it is a little bit metal but a lot of it is just the number of hands you can get let's see Kari says can we use our bonus points on poker coaching I'm not sure somebody asked if they could swap products out because they already have some of these Remy and Alex at poker head rush calm and I'll see what I can do Ray said listening to exploitative play for the second time great stuff how much applies to wcp events 1,500 and above fifteen hundreds a lot 2004 cuz a lot of these guys know this stuff but I mean look around at your table like if they're all grinders the Jonathan littell stuff is really good for that Jonathan littell stuff is really good at screwing with good players like I love how Jonathan little plays poker I've played I played with John in Vegas quite a bit and he's really hard as somebody who thinks about poker everyday studies poker everyday that stuff is really hard to pick off so I would the exploitative stuff is that tends to be what I use in low to mid stakes and that tends to be what I teach because it's really fun and I can simplify it quite a bit which is really helpful for coaching but you do have to work and some of the Geto stuff with better opponents I'd really recommend reading the limitations of exploitative play you can find on Jonathan littell site that's something I wrote about why I like how why I like Jonathan little style and why I like exploitative lines as well someone said you can use your bonus credits I've done it many times awesome thank you Chris what are the common mistakes people do when trying to implement over betting into their strategy Alex I think they usually what happens is they get caught like once a month and then they they get so embarrassed because people make fun of them so much they just never do it again that's the biggest mistake I see um I think people over bet for value too much that's really a good cash game strategy but most people just kind of poop themselves in tournaments with / met enfold Emily O'Grady says I play pretty low stakes tournaments and I love learning as much as I can about the game but there are opponents who have no idea and I find it difficult to shift to a different mode to play against them eg older players who just won't fold a high pair with over cards out there reduced bluffing frequency is what I know for sure how about those players Emily if you want the just basics basics of how to win it No Limit Hold'em play big pots vs. wide ranges and just try to get them to fold their high cards if you get one person heads up the thing they're gonna have most the time is high cards almost any see that will be profitable do not try to get people to fold pairs in low to mid stakes that is a great way to go broke fast what you're gonna do when when a bunch of people limp you gotta raise big right we're talking like 4x + 2 X for each limb per pot plus the big blind right you get a heads up versus one player you see bet you just trying to get their high cards out if they call you they've got a pair it's most likely one of the pairs on the board and they're not folding it so if you have a pair that's better than that pair get every cent you can from them never hit the brakes but if you've missed you just gotta accept reality on reality's terms and wave through your time so there's a lot of questions while I just went on that tirade so let me keep going how would you start playing the first few levels in the W so P in big 50 aggressive or passive I show up I am aggressive from the start because you know what everybody plays like it's me let me ask you this dog lift how many times have you played a live tournament played one hour look down at your stack and went where did 15 percent of my stack go I want to be the guy getting everybody's 15 percent of the stack because most people they open whatever they feel like III bet it doesn't seem like that much they call and then they're in this pot out of position that they didn't really prepare for I want to be the initiator in every one of those pots that's where I want to be I look for the guy I think is opening too much almost everybody opens too much from the low Jack hi jack cut off now and I'm just 3betting from the start it seems that one of the biggest things for me to focus on the most is proper best sizing any advice on how to optimize this Chad it the fastest way I could do that is if you think your opponent as a big range you can bet bigger just forget a lot of the high cards to fold out if you think it's a tight range usually you should bet smaller just because if they are folding they're probably they were folding to whatever right people that play tight ranges tend to have a specific way they play poker so betting big since they don't have many high cards anyway that's not gonna fold them out a time you should just take a little shot uh Ryan says what poker players should I be playing you should be following Jonathan little because this stuff is just yang Buster's good I'd like to think I helped a lot of low and mid stakes guys that's been my job for a long time and I've seemed to have had a lot of success at it Evan Jarvis is really good Matt Affleck is really good he doesn't work anymore but Matthew John is he created a lot of the stuff that we use today he's a yo-yo here Doug Pogue bring him up and Matthew John they're like really blew my mind he has great books Ray Villa Minh says newp prep material in particular on the site you would recommend all of the actually this one particular how to think like a poker player that just kills in American tournaments anything below 2k and then this is how you expand it once you get some guys that start sticking around after the flop and this stuff just adds even more plays Emily says great thanks so much awesome Arlene says I've seen a lot of over betting in lower six tournaments especially in early levels and a lot early stage due to rebuy Z and Reba's pee time to go with it pretty fast by the way that was really funny somebody's had coffee good you haven't known me very well the funny thing is this is a performance right i teaching is very much a performance are the better you teach the more people understand so you have to be engaged you have to be focused so showing up your tired is not fair to you guys you're you're spending your night learning from me you could be watching any TV show you could be watching any streaming site you'd be watching anything and instead you're here with me so out of respect for you guys I always show up with all my notes I write down a script I drink a cup of coffee and I just I'm try to be as pleasant for you guys as possible Douglas says thank you so much learn so much tonight you are very welcome Chad says thank you you're very welcome and then my stuff just blew up what is the threshold of a buying cost to qualify from small stakes to mid Chad it really depends on Chad the practical consideration is when does the exploitative stuff stop working and I think it tends to stop working at like it tends to be like two K's are higher in Vegas in Europe on the East Coast it's like higher than 3.5 K a lot of these stuff worked luckily I recently was lucky enough to get what was it I played the Borgata event there was like 1,100 people to start I got into the final 30 and then I dusted it up right but a lot of this stuff worked in the morgana like main of that right it wasn't till the final 30 where I was like whoa these guys can play right then you have to start shifting to more the Geto stuff and you got to start watching your frequencies a little bit but yeah it depends on the part of the world a lot somebody asks is cardrona cv a good program it's a great program I wrote an entire book using card runners eBay the meth and powder talent alex any chance you can do a webinar on playing draws in and out of position at different stacked ups after getting most of yours and Jonathan littles webinars this is the one that I'm not too sure about that it definitely has some merits there's a yeah there'll be a fun one no it's a good idea Chris I'll think about that it does come up in a lot of my lectures the hardest part with poker is it's just so expansive right it's it is so very much I'll hold on a second guys hold on one second guys I have a little have a little issue let's see one second everybody I'm still here well the master the flop package one second everybody so sorry I just had a little thing come up okay can't wait to get home and dig into how to think like a poker player somebody said they're playing $10 in lower on ACR this stuff will definitely work there is the hip is a GM - worth it oh yeah definitely Benjamin stator says I'm the beginner plus what is the best course for me this is the how to think like a poker player Benjamin will rock at you off to everything else chances so I can navigate the big 50 just a it just as I just as I would in a $100 tourney definitely Richard says thank you Alex always a great webinar thank you for saying where to start in how to advance through the profit products is it reasonable to learn this stuff part-time after work in seven weeks absolutely so if you think about it if you study like seven weeks yeah so if you do thirty minutes a day it's about fifteen hours so you'll get it in about thirty days yeah definitely Arlene says I can't wait to try what you've taught here thank you very much you could be doing something else - thank you very much oh no it's it's okay McGill Chavez says you know in South America what is the threshold I think you're okay pretty much everywhere but Brazil it's honestly though it's been a while since I played in South America said oh you're gonna have to you're gonna have to use your judgement a lot of them do learn from the American players though any tips for a new poker player trying to improve their game play mostly microstates and have a winning record but Santa can't seem to move up and medium stakes um this I honestly I'm really gonna keep bringing up how to think like a poker player because I was really like master the flop adds a ton of stuff to but it's very specialized like on this flop do this how to think like a poker player is what my friends when they need to learn how to play poker that's the one I got them right and it really simplifies things and it'll make you see things in a much different way uh somebody's asking how advanced the these ones this stuff if you could understand the lecture you just saw you're gonna be just fine ken says do you have your own podcast why yes I do go to one outer com and you can listen to it mark says thanks Alex what else are you over betting on the turn and when you get called and you have ace high what is your plan on a blank river well the reason why it's a good the reason why it's a good reason to over bet as a bluff is why it's a bad river bat it's a good idea to double barrel be really big because the guy has a bunch of nothing and he's only calling with the best hands it's but when he gets to the river he has the best hands therefore a bet would not be that great so you really should just check if up if you think about if you want to be balanced when that guy has a condensed range that's what Matthew janta talked about big bets make the most sense because you're not really betting trying to get value from high cards or folding out high cards it's all pairs therefore value bets should be bigger and Bluff should be bigger somebody said please show the five post-flop plays again again what do you mean over bet the term when your opponent caps is range that means when it's unlikely for him to have anything more than a pair go ahead and over bat so the here's the five post-flop tricks you can use Frank says I have all of these products except for how to think like a poker player anyway to get it for a discount Frank write me at Alex at poker Eddie rush calm and I'll talk with John and we can figure something out Ben says awesome I can't tell you how much appreciative you are sharing your knowledge hey this is a really fun job and don't worry about it thank you for tuning on it's like helping my little bank robbers we're gonna go rob a casino right guys here's the schematics let's do it does that mean obviously if it succeeds we all work right like we all do well Michael says thank you so much as I like all yours and Jonathan webinars and products yes sir be sure to be playing Michael be sure to be using all of it study play study play I really appreciate it Kerry Kerry says thank you so much for getting me studying flawed zillion card readers evey the first two weeks were frustrating but it's starting to pay off now I'm buying you breakfast and Vegas I like that really appreciate that Kerry let me even I think it's a boring breakfast now it's weird when you're playing a poker tournament you can't eat white carbs because it just gives you this glycemic spike and then you're just screwed right so you have to eat pretty much eggs bring your own avocados Nicholas says why check raise 3x every time and not higher is this to maintain balance or for another reason I find when you go up to 3x Nicolas that's a really good question people just call without thinking Rick says thank you Alex I just superb I just purchased I appreciate Thank You Dakota says thank you is this good for all my also yes sir if you go lower than $100 tournaments excuse me Alex Quinn says how do you deal with tilt in the middle of tourney's I have had a hard time shaking off mistakes or hiccups while I'm still playing thank you by the way for the great content Alex that is uh the first thing you got to recognize alex is your brain is not meant to gamble I would recommend reading any book you can about neuro economics if you ever want to do this seriously your money in your brain is grade Thinking Fast and Slow is great if you enjoyed Moneyball by Micheal Lewis he wrote another book called the undoing project which is all about this the human mind is not made for financial risk and reward so first of all your brain is just not meant for it and you really have to train it away too you got to play with money you can afford to lose three you got to kind of pretend it's loss and a lot of this you know what I realized a lot of times when I tilted it was entitlement like it's really funny we'll enter a tournament with a thousand people in we all for some reason think moi is gonna win think about deeply insane that is now narcissism is actually very natural to the human condition if you think about a baby a baby is very narcissistic it does not think of other creatures because if it were not narcissistic the baby would probably die therefore the narcissistic baby has to cry out for food that is very intelligent right that is an evolutionary by-product that has made us go further but it's really hard to get rid of when we're playing poker we really think these special things are supposed to happen to us so the way I tell it to myself alex is like look if I was going into a fistfight I would expect to get hit if I'm going to play no llem and hold him especially No Limit Hold'em tournaments I'm expecting something goofy to happen every single time you play poker No Limit Hold'em especially things are going to happen right it is not going to be perfect it never goes right if I walked into a fist fighting a guy hit me and I turn around and when he hit me you would think I was insane but that's really what it sounds like to me when people go like I had a pair and he outdrew me and once I started thinking about it like and I started doing way about her Renee says I recently have committed to note-taking and targeting very tiring at first now when I don't it definitely feels like something is missing what do you recommend Renee if you get tired when you play the only thing that's gonna help you is you gotta work outside of it are you gonna brag pose coming but I lift weights three times a week and it's not there's a lot of days I show up I don't want to do it right but it's one of those things you're gonna feel it if you don't do it right you gotta eat as well as possible you got a lift away it's got to take care of yourself you can't be drinking anywhere near a tournament you can't be any of that now let's say you go all that now you got to simplify what you simplify is just what do people open what do people check back what do people free back and do people have any ostentatious behaviors that you can take advantage of jim says thanks Alex great as always Keith says off topic do you drink anymore because I would like to have a drink with you and talk minor league baseball I am totally fine having a coffee and talking baseball I have retired from drinking I had a good run but uh yeah I just can't do it anymore hi Alex I enjoyed your commentary on stones and twitch Thank You Gary I really appreciate that awesome job Alex you and Jonathan are my favorite teachers why thank you Alex I appreciate that George's gurgi who says to hey you be you from Astoria you sound like you are yeah just purchase the assassin package let the fund again thank you Alex and nice I appreciate that George Carey says what's your favorite out for taking notes at the table while playing just anything would work Evernote OneNote anything thanks Alex I enjoy the fun analysis you are welcome Matt I appreciate that Frank says any advice on how to deal with extended periods of being card debt or a video on that you'd recommend remember it's eight people versus one and you only get to see 30 hands an hour it would be really strange if you didn't have a two-hour span where you didn't get a hand dave says entitlement plus pride has cost me lots of Germany's man you've to maybe you both rather I'm gonna put this out just again boom discount offer and may 19th 2019 michael says what do you think of mirrored glasses in the use of them i like to use them from time to time prepare inside as long as you can keep them not exposing your cards i wear sunglasses when I'm tired I don't want people watching me my eyes my eyes shift around a lot so everybody always thinks I'm bluffing which is not good dave says how much do you incorporate poker towels into your game the really big one Zachary Elwood has a book that's like $10 unaudible or even if it's 20 you should pay for it it's called exploiting poker towels but that will help you with most the big thing is when people have you ever looked at your hand before it's your turn to act and it's aces did you make any noise now most people are quiet as a church mouse when they look down at a big hand and that tends to extend to preflop and flop so any ostentatious behavior at those times tends to clip off the biggest hands it might still be a scam it might still be tens but it's not going to be aces right but the thing about that is if I can clip aces and kings and queens from your rage I can three bet with a bandit right and there are guys that have tells like that really big online players and Jennifer says Alex thank you for this excellent material for students considering your products I would highly recommend any of them I started with one and when I finished I couldn't wait to see the next each one has overlapping concepts but also new concepts are grow and learn from that they all fit together I'm working through each one for a second time and maybe we'll even do some three times alex is the best teacher and his videos come to the top concepts to help me to help solidify your game thank you very much John really appreciate that steve says you're the best my friend now you the best Steve it's really good to see you're here Steve Bob in Florida says off subject but I got asked what's the reason the open raises are 2.5 X n hundred big blank stacks is this a new norm or just a convenience just a convenience and to make it look like a table you'd actually say Bob Bob says thanks for the books gotten both glad you got him and the other thing uh no I mean to be a lot of people ask me why do you like big raises and it's like well I like big pots versus big ranges heads up so if I can make it 3.5 X and nobody else will touch it but the big blind will call that's what I'm gonna do it right but there's some times when you're dealing with short sacks and people are just gonna Jam regardless that size you don't need to go that big and sometimes I'll show you guys two point five x raises to make it look more like your games Nikolas says how do you handle massive down swings that will only play with money you can afford to lose you got to play with a pornographically large bankroll and play the lowest stakes you're gonna few Kingdom stand was the biggest bankroll Ned who ever played the game and everybody made fun of me and I'm still here 13 years later went pro in 2006 biggest bankroll net you've ever seen in every time I have not followed bankrolled guidelines I've regretted it Michael says have you ever fallen asleep at the table yep I haven't realized I shouldn't play this day yeah I did I did that uh like when I was younger I just lived at the card room right yeah there were definitely times that happened that's not a good idea Mikey said Mickey says what types of food to stay away from during long multi-day attorneys Mickey I would really recommend like good healthy fats what tends to help me the most and obviously this is a sample size in one but like avocados cashews almonds stuff like that lean protein tends to be really good in lots of veggies mark says you wrap in these days where you have part I don't wrap when I'm at word man hmm I'm uh I don't know I get I'll get back to battle and it's just you know I've been trying to make my business work lately all right guys I'm gonna wrap this up here pretty soon lace is off now Alex thanks will definitely buy the package thank you for that should I have a study session with my local 22:30 weekly tournament buddies to make them better so it helps me play better or let them be terrible to be against terrible players uh I would really that's a good one no I would learn how to play with bad players and then you'll you'll find good players to talk with Gary says could you recommend a good Mouse you know what Gary I never found a mouse that worked really well I just work with a car carpal tunnel glove perpetual a now you can do wrist exercise Dave says thanks Gary says thanks Chad says thanks Chad says here oh gee I appreciate that Thomas says thanks Alex my big win 194 K

[Document(page_content="hello everyone can someone type in chat if they can hear me I want to check to make sure my audio is working perfect seems like our audio is working I'll give this another 30 seconds or so we'll get started I want to encourage everyone ask questions throughout the webinar I'll help lead the discussion I have my stuff to talk about and then answering questions will also help and then at the end we'll also have a question and answer segment but today we're gonna be just talking about tournaments tax and adjustments unity making on your stack sizes in tournaments I think it's one of the easier fixes people can make but it's also one of the bigger mistakes that I think weaker players are making in tournaments right now not making these adjustments to their ranges based off of stack sizes so it's one o'clock now let's go ahead and get started this question stemmed from you know I had a student ask that made a to of a 300 dollar buying tournament he had a big stack of a hundred big blinds but there was a lot of short stacks it was a three dollar buy and so it's you know a more terrible instructor structure and he's asking you know what adjustments do you be making as stack sizes shrink or more importantly for him how stocks vary from Player to Player so when I have 100 big blinds but other players have 25 big blinds what adjustments should I be making and I think the most important question is how are my range is affected by these stack sizes and that's what we're going to be looking at today so to start off we're gonna kind of get into the basics hand values and stacked ups and this is kind of the meat and potatoes of this webinar and kind of the most important part to take out of it and this is kind of the easy quick adjustments that you need to make with stock sizes so first two Bowl points are they're kind of the most important generalizations so as stock sizes D the value of big offsuit cards increase and a stack sizes increase the value of suited connectors also small pocket pairs increase so there's kind of a inverse a relationship between the two and it's really important which types of hands you should be playing based off what your stock size is so at 150 big blinds deep so this would be you know the first couple hours of a tournament first few levels of a tournament you want what hands like make better than one pair now that's a little misleading comment because any two unpaired cards have the same exact chance of making two pair for example Ace King has the same exact chance of making two pairs deuce three without taking into consideration like card removal and stuff but the benefit of Ace King is Ace King can make they're not straight let's look at even another example of a hand like 10 9 suited 10 9 suited yeah I can make two pair but it can also make a ton of straights and flushes so we're really looking at suited miss and connectedness when we're playing 150 big blind seed that's the biggest thing you need to take away from this when we're 50 big blinds deep you want hands they can make good top pairs so for example let's look at a hand like King Jack offsuit versus 10 9 suited at 150 big ones deep 10 9 suit is an amazing hand because you make a ton of straight so you can make you know I don't even know how many combinations are straight is but the 6 7 8 the 8 Queen Jack and then you can also make flushes versus King Queen you can make Broadway a couple different straights but you can't make any flushes and it makes the playability to him much worse but at 50 big blinds King Queen on a King 8 4 board becomes a really really powerful hand and as we get into stack to pot ratios later on we will find out that it's easier to stack off with good top pairs when you're 50 big blinds deep versus when you're 150 with one steep you need a lot better than a good top pair to stack off so I want to look at these two ranges here on the right that we have the top range is gonna be kind of a this is like a middle position opening range at 150 big blinds as you can see we're playing all suited aces all the suited eights all these suited connectors suited one gap was like nine seven stood at eight six suited seven five student and all pocket pairs but take a look at the offsuit combos we're only raising Ace King off ace queen off King Queen off and ace Jack offsuit so that's only four different types of off suit hands that we're gonna be raising and that's really important when we're playing 150 big blinds deep in middle position just take a look at how suited heavy this range is and it's very suited pocket pair heavy and this sets us up really well post flop at 150 big blinds because we're playing hands that can make flushes straights sets strong two pairs and so we're not opening a lot of garbage hands you know King 10 off is 10 off ace nine off etc now this bottom range is a 50 big blind range and we have three different colors here and I'll point out at the bottom at the end here so the color in the red are all those same hands in 150 big blind range the blue the blue hands are now hands that we are folding preflop at 50 big blinds so 50 big blinds were no longer raising deuces reach fours 5 4 suited 65 suited 7 6 2 2 8 6 suited Jack 8 10 8 suited and then ace 4 HD suited the wheel aces and a seven and a six suited the green are now hands that we are raising at 50 big blinds so ace nine off ace 10 off King 10 off King Jack and Queen Jack so it looks like where we folded like a lot of extra hands but we added in all these off suit combos and when you look at combos there's 12 ways to make an off suit hand and four ways to make a suited hand so the kind of thing I want to point out is this range is actually almost the same percentage of hands we've just shifted our range from these smaller suited connectors smaller pocket pairs and smaller suited aces to these offsuit Broadway hands like a standoff King 10 off King Jack so we took out 70 combos here in blue 5.3 percent of hands to 70 combos and we added in 60 combos so we only are raising 0.8% less I think this range was like around nineteen twenty percent and now we're raising nineteen point two percent somewhere there actually I guess it's a like twenty three this is like twenty four percent this is twenty three percent so we're not really raising much tighter at fifty big blinds then we were at 150 we've just changed the type of hands that were raising so that's the really key thing to pick up out of these two charts here is how we shift our arrange from small hands to big hands so and this is like a middle position range that we're gonna be raising you know we don't have time today to go through every position I kind of picked middle position because it's still we're opening kind of loose but we are also it's not like a button range we're gonna be opening 40 to 50 percent of hands so just looking through these questions really quick but so key thing here see how we've shifted our range from lower suited connectors lower pairs to these offsuit Broadway hands continuing discussing this again we have the two same charts they're just now all in red the top one is the 150 big blind chart from middle position the bottom one is a fifty big blind chart so now you can kind of see how that range looks with just the 50 percent or 50 big one chart down here so 150 to 200 big blinds hand play ability is much more important Sudanese and connectedness of hands is really important like I talked about in the last slide offsuit Broadway's and a sex become less valuable so our hands are all our offsuit aces basically we're only opening ace jack-off and ace queen off in early position I think you should be you can definitely be folding ace jack-off suit so there's barely any offsuit hands were opening set value of your pocket pairs increases we are you know we have we're deep enough where we can call three bets with our smaller pocket pairs to try to set mine at shorter stacks you're not getting them correct implied odds to call three bets with these smaller pocket pairs now I will say a little caveat at 200 big blinds you know what these deuces threes and fours you need to be a little careful because you're setting yourself all tiny but to be set over set so be wary of that in the most important thing strong top pairs cannot stack off for example if you have a scary beast queen and the flop comes a 7-3 and then the turn is a flush like basically with that one pair if you're playing a 400 big blind pot or a 300 big one pot you're probably not gonna be good with one pair you shouldn't be good at 100 big blinds this is kind of the middle ground your student connectors as pairs still have some value the big offsuit combos like ace Jack and ace queen become a little bit more valuable with that the stack to pot ratio is gonna be a little smaller strong pout stop top pairs can start to play for stacks especially in 3bet pots and your three better range is more blocker oriented but still wants playability we're gonna talk about three betting adjustments here in the next slide hands like ace Jack and ace Queen here when I'm talking about these comes very valuable in three bet pots because once you three bet the pots gonna start to get a little bit bloated so playing a three bet pot at a hundred big blinds is kind of like playing a single raised pot at 50 big blinds if that makes sense so for example if someone opens two three big blinds and you three bet to ten big blinds and they call the pots now going to be around 20 big blinds and you're gonna have 90 big blinds behind so there's a four and a half to one stack the pot ratio we're gonna get into that a little bit versus at 50 big blinds when someone raises you call you're gonna kind of have about that same stack to pot ratio at 50 big blinds small pocket begin to lose value as you can see we're now folding hands like deuces threes and fours offsuit Broadway hands gained a lot of value the off seat broad white hands gain a lot of value and any top pair and a three that pot can now stack off in these three bet pots so your three better range is more locker oriented at 50 big blinds we're gonna get into that three betting adjustments now but the key things still to take away is the studentís in the top grid at 150 big blinds versus more offsuit hands here playing at the 50 big blinds so I want to talk a little bit now about adjustments in 3-betting based off stock sizes and again we're gonna be talking about the types of hands that you want to be making these adjustments with so 150 big blinds your 3-betting range kind of like your opening range is very suited connector heavy and very weel ace suited heavy so at 150 big blinds here at the top this is what a three-bet range might look like a polarized 3-betting range of jacks or better Ace King and ace Queen suited those are our value hands the more important thing to look at here here's our Bluffs we're bluffing with hands like six five suited seven six two eight seven suited these student 1 gaffers like nine seven eight six and seven five suited ten nine suited and ace five and H four suited this would be a very polar decent three betting strategy at 150 big blinds as you can see we're value three betting about forty four combos and bluffing with thirty six combos here so we're fairly balanced in terms of the number of combos each and we have good board coverage so the problem with a lot of weaker players deep stacked at 150 big blinds is they three bet and call and they don't Bluff enough and so let's say I'm playing against a player who I perceived to be weak and I open in middle position and then a player three bets the button and this player is pretty tight and I don't think has a 3-bit bluffing range I call I'm gonna put them on this top read range like jacks Queens Kings aces Ace King maybe ace Queen suited now the flop comes five six seven I am just going to pound on him when the flop comes five six seven if I don't think he's ever bluffing because his range is jacks Queens Kings aces ace king he doesn't hit that board at all and I'm gonna have all these middling pocket pairs and Mitylene suited connectors that he doesn't have and it's gonna be really hard for him to plagues I have so many two pair of straight sets and so this is kind of why you want to have a bluffing range to protect yourself in those spots and if you three about a range like this on the button let's say against a middle position open now when the flop comes five six seven hey we can have two pair seven six we have all these pair and straight draws even if you three about nine eight students you're gonna have a straight ace 5 and H four suta these are great for covering like the deuce three four four five all these flush boards the key thing I want to point out here also is I'm not saying three about these exact hands you don't have to three bet nine seven suited you don't have to three bet ten nine students like you can three bet it's more the type of hands you can three about nine eight suited you can 3 about five four six four seven four eight five suited nine six suited you want to be three betting these hands that are playing much better a very deep stack depth that can make straights and flushes and give you some board coverage now at fifty big blinds the range is going to change a lot in terms of where we draw our three bit Bluff strong and this is one of the biggest mistakes that players make plain short stack from Louis ya hands like ace Queen off ace Jack suited we would be just calling with on the button this is just the hands that are gonna be rear AZ with and from Stan our ace deuce suited and ace three suited that much worse than H four student H five student or do they just add too many Bluffs into our range it's kind of a combination of both like I said before in the types of hands you can definitely three about a three and ace to student but you have that little added equity with the ace five and H four Souter when our opponent has deuces and threes they are better hands you're gonna make slightly you're gonna make a pair of fives you're gonna have dominated a little bit more when he has five six suited or five seven suited and the five comes on the flop just you know a little bit stronger hand you just don't want to you can't be bluffing every combination but it's just combination of both we don't want to be bluffing too much in 85 student is stronger than ace deuce and has some more equity when called so at 50 big blinds the bigger a sec suited hands are gonna be part of our bluffing range and offs you Broadway heavy range so we're gonna have a wider value range at 50 big blinds so when we're three betting off of 50 big blinds we need less of a the value threshold is lower so when you're three betting at a hundred or 150 big blind you need a stronger hand to stack off because you're risking 150 big blinds when you three about fifty big blinds you can stock off with a little bit less of a hand because you're only risking 50 big blinds so you can have more hands for value which also means you can have some more hands for Bluffs so in this value range we've added a hand like pocket tens ace Queen suited ace Jack suited ace Queen off king queen suited kind of Anor value range and our Bluffs have changed drastically we no longer are three bit bluffing these smaller suited connectors are three that bluffing range has gotten stronger in terms of now with three betting these ace nine ace ace five suited and then this region here the ace Jack King Jack ace 10 off in King 10 off and the reason why do we want to start now three betting these ace jacks King tens ace 10 King Jack off there's a couple of reasons first our three betting range now we're more concerned about blockers to therefore about shoving range so when we three bet their range they're gonna call sometimes but this is starting to get that stacked up where they can just move all in over our three that and so we really want to make sure that we're blocking their shoving range so hands like tens Jack's Queens Kings aces Ace King ace Queen ace Jack these are the types of hands that they might for bet shove with over our three bet so a hands like ace Jack ace ten kington King Jack we're blocking those hands so it's less likely that we get shoved on and more likely we get to see a flop and when we do see a flop with these hands we're gonna flop good strong top pairs on a sinking high boards where our decisions are gonna be really easy post-flop now one of the questions I poise or is like why would we three bet a hand like King 10 off suit but not three but King Queen off suit and I think this is kind of an important concept that I threw in here that I think a lot of people even really good players don't get when you're three betting there's a couple you're either bluffing or you're three betting for value so your Bluffs you know you're gonna have some equity in the hand but the main thing you want to happen when you three bet a bluff is them to fold a hand that's better than yours so when we three bet a hand like King 10 off if we get King Queen off suit or King Jack offsuit which are gonna be opening in middle position say middle position opens and we three bet on the button with King 10 off suit there's a lot of people are gonna fold King Jack offsuit for sure and maybe even King Queen off suit and now we just fold it out of hand that's seventy percent you know with versus our hands so we have a much better we just got him to fold seventy percent equity which is a huge win for us same with ace 10 off suit we can get ace Jack to fold King Jack we can get King Queen to fold you want to be three betting a hand so if we three about king queen ace queen or a skein are never gonna fold and hands like King 10 off suit in King Jack off so you are gonna fold so with king queen not many better hands are gonna fold Ace King and ace Queen in particular the only hands they're gonna fold or maybe like pocket low pocket pairs or suited connectors and King Jack and King turn these hands that we dominate now fold so we'd rather us flat with a hand like King Queen and let King Jack and King 10 stay in the pot hopefully we can flop a king dominate them and now we may have a good chance of doubling up at 50 big blinds versus if we three that King Queen they fold King Jack we just lost a really good situation for us again it's not important to remember these exact ranges these are more examples of types of hands that you want to be three betting you want to focus on categories of hands that so off suit Broadway's at 50 big blinds wheel suited ace in Middle East the wheel suited ace is at 150 big line like H 5 and H for suited are very good two three betting and then when you get down to 50 we're no longer we want to be three buddy more like a snide suited ace eight suited Taipans rather than being two-wheel suited heavy so someone asked with ace five stood on the other end I am blocking one five and someone else could be have five six suited so yes you could be folding out a hand like five six suited but the really good thing about ace five suited is now hands like ace 10 off suit ace 9 offsuit ace jack-off suit you get a lot of better aces to fold even possibly a hand like pocket sixes might thrilled to your three bet so someone asked with a snide student if we get a pair on ace in a three bet pop versus early position are we ok stacking off with it no again these Rangers I was talking about from the first example these are more like middle position versus early position and these examples while we might not be stacking off we can at least get one or two sheets of value the hand becomes much easier to play when we have top pair so fifty big blinds here with the ace nine suited yeah we're gonna if we get a lot of resistance will be more cautious but the hands can play much easier at 50 big ones and at 150 big blinds so keep in mind types of hand so that we're gonna be three betting at fifty types of hands that we're gonna be three bedded in a hundred and fifty and then the main thing being the suited connectors to do real aces at 150 and then a lot of these offices Broadway's also at 150 I didn't mark him in this example but again we're talking about types hands good types of hands to three but it would be a hand like King nine suited Jack nine suited ten nine suited is always a really good hand to three both and those have the properties of if we three better hand like King nine suited we're getting hands like King 10 off King jack off to fold a snide off the fold and we still have a pretty good playability and we can make good top pairs with King nine queen nine Jack the student nines and suta dates this section of the grid become also decent three bets a fifty big blind stack so Matthew asks a decent question should we do doing more value three betting with smaller stacks with ace Queen and ace jack and the answer is yes those hands become more value oriented the shorter your stack especially the students so ace Queen suited ace Jack suited I think are very good value three bets are fifty big blinds players are gonna call your three bet and then you're gonna flop top pairs that you dominate especially because most players are gonna Jam with their ace King preflop so a screen becomes a very good value three bet at fifty big blinds because you know if they flat call now they never have ace king so three letting ace queen at fifty big blinds it's really good because you make them play the range face up because they're almost always gonna just jam with ace king and so ace high boards now are so easy to play with ace Queen you have the nuts first is it 150 big blinds if these three about ace Queen offsuit at 150 they might just call with ace king so now you still have to be kind of cautious than a cyborg so he's ace queen and ace jack type hands become better three bets at fifty big blinds and 150 because ace king is mostly gonna be jamming against your three bet and so you kind of clear up your outs Stannis and our fifty big blind stack range are we calling off to a four bet with all these hands in red or are we folding the weaker ones that king queen off ace Jack suited ace Queen off yes so against most players especially if you're playing a small stakes tournament like let's say you're playing a $300 buy-in tournament and you have fifty big blinds the caliber of play is not gonna be as high and I would always three bet this red range and then I would fold ace queen off ace Queen suited ace Jack suited to the for bet Jam and the king queen suited because players are going to play very face-up once you three Benham they're gonna just for bet with their really good hands but majority people are just gonna call way too much and you're just getting a lot of value with your ace queen and ace jack if your planet gets really tough opponent turn in a four-bit jam hands like ace five suited or pocket fives more aggressive opponents then maybe you can just call with some of those hands or you can start three back calling those hands as well but it kind of depends on your opponent there so let's keep going on this I'm gonna get to some of these questions later stack the pot ratio you've heard me talked about this the first couple of times I want to go over it some people may have not heard the term before or not familiar with it ties back into everything hand playability is driven by SPR which is what we refer to for stock to pot ratio so SPR is driven by how stacks deep are so two examples were played 150 big blinds there's a 3x open from early position the button calls the pot is now eight and a half big blinds so three big blinds plus three big blinds from the two calls one and a half big blinds from the ant the small blind big blind and one big blind from the ante so it's eight and a half a blinds now the effective stacks are 147 big blinds after the raise so the SPR is 147 divided by eight point five which is 17 is a 17 SPR so you have 17 times the pot left in the stacks left to be played the other example at 50 big blinds we open 2 2 and 1/2 X the button calls the pot is now 7 and 1/2 big blinds so 2 & a half & 2 & a half that's 5 plus 1 & a half from the two blinds and then a 1 ante so at 7 and a blinds the stack is 47 and 1/2 big blinds now so your SPR is just over six six and 1/3 SPR so there's a big difference but in the stacks left to play and this is what kind of drives this hand playability and why we choose certain hands to play in our ranges versus others so these are not hard and fast rules but just kind of a general rule of thumb so when you get an SPR of less than five you're really good top pairs become strong enough to stock off so for example we're playing 40 big blinds deep we raise King Queen off see in the middle position and the button calls the pot seven-and-a-half big blinds there's 37 and a half big blinds stuff to play our SPRs five the flop comes Queen eight forward and we know the SPR is five and we've flopped a really strong top pair now we're probably starting to plan our strategy by to try to get the money in here by the river we've got five big blinds on the flop our opponent calls the pot is now 17 and a half big blinds stacks are 32 so now the SPR is about two now on the turn the turn is the seven of diamonds brings a flush draw five six gets there we've got twelve and a half big blinds into seventeen and a half and our opponent calls so now the pot is 42 big blinds and the stacks are 20 big blinds so now the Stockton ratio on the river is 0.5 there's only 20 big blinds left in the stack and 42 big blinds in the stock the pot the river is the nine of hearts with such a short stack to pot ratio with only 20 big blinds we shove four half pot our opponent and this is a key point with the SPR we're playing only 40 big blinds deep our opponent is likely to a three bet or raise a hand like ace queen or better by the turn to the shallow stacks so King Queen becomes much stronger hand at this SBR because how a screen would have played when we're this shallow ace queen likely could have just shoved the turn or raised the flop at this point same with sets of eights or any two weird two pair combos on the flop or eight seven on the term when the stacks are so shallow they're just incentivized to get the money in now before a bad card or before before the board comes too scary so you know I would think in a lot of spots like this ace queen would have try to get the money in before the river and so king queen becomes a much stronger hand versus in our next example we're gonna look at it's just the the key point here it's very easy to get stacks in at a sub five SPR without big bedding we bet two-thirds pot two-thirds pot and we were already left with a half pot bet on the river so we could even bet half pot half pot and probably shove the river for like two-thirds pot so when you're less than five SPR it's just so easy to get the money in when you want to let's look at the opposite example when you have an SP are greater than five you need to be a little more cautious with top their hands so same example but we're a hundred big blinds deep we raised with King Queen off the middle position and the button calls pot seven and a half the stacks are ninety seven and a half and the SPR is thirteen the flop comes Queen eight for rainbow we met five our opponent calls so the pot seventeen and a half star ninety eight and a half's now the stack to pot ratio is a little over five on the flop it turns the seven of diamonds same turn we bet twelve and a half and our opponent calls so now going in the river we still have a two SPR with eighty six big blinds left and forty two in the pot versus on the last example we had half so the SPR is four times is big in this example is the last one with the river the nine of Hearts with an SPR to here we cannot get stacks in without over bedding at some point and the key point here is at this stack depth our opponent may not have race ace Queen off so you preflop they made it just called and the flop returned with deeper sacks they might have also just called they might have used the same logic I only have one pair here I'm just gonna call I don't want to get a hundred big blinds in yet with this hand he also might have called two bets with a hand like Jack ten suited or ten nine suited um specifically Jack ten suited making it straight here it's conceivable like he'd have jack ten of diamonds where he called the flop with a gutshot turned a straight draw now he has the nuts at the shallower stacked depths Jack ten suited my show will probably still shove the turn so it's more likely there's a lot more hands that could be beating us we got and floated lighter there's more to pair combos so villains range becomes stronger here because he is less likely to stack up on the turn with ace Queen versus in the previous example ace queen is a pretty easy he just shoved the term with ace queen at the 50 big blind example now I'm where I had a hundred big blinds ace Queens a really heavy chunk of his range here when we get to the river so key key point here hand values increase at shallower SPRs even weak top pairs are stronger at shallower SPRs and hand values decrease at deeper to SPR so needs stronger hands to stack off so kind of the same concepts we've been talking about the whole webinar so we can do the question so Matthew asked what about you know Queen nine which would have river two pair or Jack 10 which would have river de straight I think Queen nine is probably not calling preflop at the fifty big blind example and it's more likely a hand like Queen nine could have called at the hundred big blind example same with Jack ten Jack 10 off suit maybe it calls that a hundred big blinds versus at fifty it probably folds so I just think the ranges are easier to pinpoint ranges at the shallower stacks versus a deeper stack strangers are wider there's more combinations of random two pairs that can be made more accommodations and floats you're less likely to get floated at a shallow stack depth and a shallow SPR than you are at a very heavy SPR greater than five like you can float a lot more because you have more implied odds you have more maneuverability on later streets like for example let's say we this flop at the so in this less than five SPR let's say where the button and we have ace deuce of diamonds and the button bets five big blinds we call with our backdoor flush draw back to a straight draw now the turn is the seven of diamonds and he bets two-thirds pot like we're barely getting the right price to call with our flush draw and over like we're getting the right price but it's not that great of a situation because if we don't hit we we have very little way to win the pot he's just gonna shove the river we likely won't get a chance to Bluff on the river versus it a hundred big blinds with the SPR greater than five I'm more happy to float with a hand like ace deuce of diamonds here because there's another eighty six big blinds behind on the term when we call when we hit this backdoor flush draw and we can now we can represent that hand like Jack ten on the the river we can represent five six more we can represent a nine eight that peeled and got sticky on the turn so there's more ways to represent at the deeper stack sizes we're getting a lot of questions coming in right now so what we're gonna do that's what I got for the slides we're gonna gonna go back and review some of these slides and the questions as I go through the questions but I just want to remind everyone that you can try poker coaching com free for seven days right now there's over 400 interactive quizzes I'm making quizzes every month my quizzes are released every week I quizzes are a great way to warm up for your sessions I have an article that will be coming out on poker coaching about warming up for your sessions and one of the ways I like to warm up is reviewing hands and doing these interactive quizzes it gets your brain flowing to get your brain thinking in the poker way these quizzes are great great way to get one-on-one coaching for a fraction of the cost I got to walk you through exactly my thought processes thought processes and chan also there's the homework section jonathan provides a situation for your homework and he personally reviews the answers it's a great way to the homework questions are great because they're very all-inclusive you have to think outside the box and think about many different variables and there's no one right or wrong answer it's more your thought process behind it in your strategy and that's a great way to get you know personally get your homework reviewed by Jonathan and his webinar you have all these uh you know coaching webinars on there between that the quizzes and the homework there's a ton of ways to work and improve on your game I think many players even professionals don't work on their game enough I spent I mean this week alone I've probably spent eight hours away from the table doing different things working on my game a lot of players get very complacent in their poker game and don't work on their game enough and these poker training sites poker coaching comm they're great ways to get coaching from top professionals at a fraction of the cost so look at starting the seven day free trial I'm happy to be coaching there now you'll continue to see my quizzes on there you'll continue to get webinars and articles there's just a lot of value to be had at the price point and think about it this way if you're a two hundred like let's say you play one two No Limit live if you're playing you know paying for poker coaching at thirty dollars a month it doesn't take very long to make that money back like if you improve your win rate by five dollars an hour which isn't hard to do at all your guarantee like almost you can increase your win rate by five dollars an hour it doesn't take much time at all to recoup the costs and you're gonna make a lot more money it's a great investment so now I'm going to spend quite a bit time we're gonna go through all these questions I seem in the chat go ahead and keep asking questions and I will go through the next questions for the next 15 minutes or so Lewis says one session I paid he played one session that paid for three years of poker coaching calm that's great Louis is there any way we can get a copy of their slides this will be reposted on youtube so you can rewatch the video on YouTube but I actually release you to the slides I don't think that will happen possibly but we can ask Jonathan about that Darren says congratulations on the chopping at the Wynn he says can you please tell me as how or why I chopped basically just there's a ton of variants and heads up and I didn't feel like playing a heads up match for $20,000 the other guy was a professional and so chopping was just kind of a way to lock up the money and reduce a lot of variance my quizzes are tough Stan says so Erik Anderson asks how many big blinds would you stack off with second nuts third nuts these are all relative questions and they can't really be answered when I talk about you know at an espy are less than five good top pairs become easy to stack off you're just much more comfortable playing a big pot versus when you have 150 people on you have one pair you know you're not supposed to be playing a 300 big blind pot but as you see in the example that I provided at the for the SPR it's just very easy to get the money in when you want when you have less than a 5 s PR and show up shallow or stacks which is deeper stacks it's hard to get the money in so there's a good question by Ricardo so in the middle stages of a tournament if I have a hundred big blind stack and I'm the chip leader versus second place is forty five big blinds I need to use the effective stacks fifty big blind hand rage device yes so your stack size doesn't matter it's the effective stacks of the opponents so in your case if you have a hundred big blinds and everyone else at the table has fifty big blinds you should be playing your stack set your hand selection should be like a fifty big blind stack because that's the effective stats that you're playing it doesn't matter how many chips you have it's how many chips you effectively have so Richard Gutierrez similar questions are you discussing the strategy doesn't matter if the opponent has a much smaller stack size yes you're basing these strategies off of the effective stack size not your stack size so if you have 80 big blinds and someone that's 40 big blinds you should be playing it like you have 40 big blinds try and ask is this your default strategy or we assume in a loose opening range so from middle position my default strategy is going to be opening around 25% of hands I make a lot of adjustments that a key point is when you're developing your strategies you should always have kind of a baseline strategy at default strategy you might call it and then always be making adjustments versus the opponent's that you're playing are they playing too loose are they playing so too tight so I'm gonna have my default three betting Rangers that I have and then I'm gonna make adjustments if the guy who's opening too tight I'm gonna three that less if he's opening too loose that might three about more so to answer your question trying it you want to base it off your default strategies and again it's not the specific examples of hands that I said like you don't have to three bet exactly King 10 off suit you know you get three but you know King nine Queen nine it's just have a general reason of why you're doing something another type of hands that you should be three betting at those points so Matthew points out I worry with a student if I get the wheel there's some with someone else having 7 students since I'm not blocking any of those combos yes that's another reason why H 5 suited is gonna be a stronger hand than ace deuce and ace three suited because ace five you're gonna make there's me the less you're gonna you're gonna make five to six student can dominate you but it's less likely now you have a blocker to that five six suited so if it comes three four five then you have a Stu suited you have no blockers two six seven students so it's a little more likely someone gonna have that versus if you have a suited you had now the only Hanabi choose five six suited and you have a blocker to that so it's less likely that someone has it so pretty covered effective stacks so David asks what are your bet sizes when you three bet at each stack level so the deeper the sacks the larger my bet sizes are gonna be and the shallower the stacks the smaller my bet sizes are gonna be David so if you looked at when I showed the example of if you go back and review the slide where I have less than a 5s PR how easy it was for me to get the money in I bet 2/3 2/3 and then a half pot on the river at that point but E's are gonna bet something like one-third pot on the flop half pot on the turn and then shove for 2/3 pot on the river it's just very easy to get the money in and so your stack sizes versus when you're playing 150 big blinds to get the money in by the river if you want to you probably have to be betting pot pot pot or even you know pot on the flop a little over pot on the turn and then shoving for a powder over pot on the river Jeff Friedman at 150 big blinds deep two people limped in early position I have pocket fours do I raise or limp along I really like just kind of limping along with pocket fours I think players isolate way too much over limbers with fours you don't block any of their calling range like you still have all the you know king Queens ace checks and you're handed plays very hot or cold there's a lot of flops you just hate and so you know five or six times out of you know seventy eighty percent of time the flops not gonna be favorable for you with two four so you can just fold them and then now when you do flop ass-up or one of those like deuce 3/5 flops you have a cheap investment you can win a pot Chris Morgan watched a video from Jonathan little saying I almost never chopped I actually normally don't chop and I think this is the first time I chopped a live tournament but the player was very good and your edges playing heads up are pretty small and it kind of depends on bankrolls and your kind of appetite for variants and just it's kind of in the moment I just didn't feel like playing a huge heads-up match and so rather than play a 17k heads-up match like if I was just walking in the casino and someone's like hey do you want to play heads up for $17,000 I would be like no I don't want to play heads up for $17,000 it's too much money so I was kind of thinking what's the difference at this point so we headed and just did a chip chop Doug can this be applied to cash games at all or would you just reload before hitting fifty big blinds that's personal preference for myself I'd always reload so for like example an online cash game with 100 big blinds I have the setting where it will auto top me off to a hundred big blinds because I'm very comfortable playing and want to have everyone covered but if you don't you say you buy into cash games for fifty big blinds this is the this strategy would apply the same at 50 big blinds still you're gonna want to just have these hands that can make better top pairs and suited connectors and your small pairs are going to be less valuable so yes the strategy would be the same whether it's cash games or tournaments it's the same principles and fundamentals just a different format should a nuke Reynolds choose small pocket pairs be considered if you're closing the action multi-way pots with 50 big blinds yes so like in the big blind or closing the action I'm almost always gonna call with these small pairs but let's say you're in early position and so let's let's say early position raises two three big wines Nick and you are like second to act I don't want to call a pocket force because we still have five or six people left behind us and they all get three bet or squeeze and we're not gonna be we're not deep enough to call that raise so it makes a lot more sense you want to be folding even up to maybe like pocket sixes because of the stack death and how many people are left to act but when you're in the big blind of course do you always want to flick in those extra one or two big blinds you're getting well the you know correct patas to try to hit your set so Jonathan's state how do you adjust raising ranges with a fifty or hundred big blind stack when there are multiple players to your left with a twenty to twenty-five big blind region range this is a great question this is a whole nother topic that we could have gotten into but in terms of time constraints so if you have a hundred big blinds or fifty big blinds and there's a bunch of twenty to twenty-five big blind stacks and they keep going all in over your raises you need to start to tighten up it's very easy for them to just start going all in over your raises but the same concepts still apply I'd rather raise a hand like King Jack offsuit because now I'm blocking the types of hands that could reach am with versus a hammer aiming a hand like ace for offsuit becomes a little more valuable because having the ACE in your hand blocks a lot of their region range they're suited aces etc so again when the shorter stacks blockers become more relevant to region ranges versus the playability is not as important on the shorter stacks been a Richter can I use the hundred big one strategy also in cash games yes the ranges I kind of gave in there were with antes included which cash games don't have antes so you'd have to make adjustments for that but the same principles apply KP does 3bet size increase with bigger stack sizes yes the deeper the stocks the larger your three events should be the shower the three bit stack size smaller your three about should be so on fifty big blinds in position my three beds probably gonna be around two point seven two three eight times the open out of position my three of us probably to be about three and a half times maybe up to four times the open one hundred fifty big blinds in position my smallest three bit size would be like three and a half big times the open and then out of position I'm probably making it four to four and a half times the open so Matthew ass is a good idea to raise why to bully opponents in the case you described when your stack is much larger than that of anyone else in your table only if it's like an ICM spot where there's a big money jumps and people have to tie tighten up but I think a lot of mistakes people make is they get a big chip leader they have everyone covered and they just start like well I gotta be the you know alpha male and try to win every pot no you still want to keep your fundamentals you still want to you know adjust your sizes I mean adjust your ranges to the proper hands but just raising to try to bully unless they're being overly tight you just be playing good fundamental poker you want to put kind of protect your chips thank you Richard Gutierrez thank you very much your session was like drinking water from a fire hydrant lots to consider and learn Scot Simeon is poker coaching comm gear to both cash or tournament players or both both if you watch my quizzes on poker coaching comm are both live like everything I both live cash game hands I post live tournament hands I post online cash game hands and I post online tournament hands so I kind of play all four variants the hands I've the quizzes I posts are actual hands that I play I'm not really I'm not creative enough to make up hands so so these are like real-life hands that I'm playing and they're both cash and tournament live and online Thomas I kind of understand your question if you play effective second 40 big blinds how can you put a pressure on them when you have double the stack of everyone again if you have 40 big blinds and everyone else has 20 it's like you're playing a 20 big blinds of stack and when you're playing 20 big blinds you need to tighten up so just because you have 40 unless they're playing overly tight against you you need to kind of tighten up because everyone else only has 20 big blinds effective at what stack size do you stop shoving kinking pre louis ass the deeper the stacks are say like 150 200 big blinds it becomes quite common to just be flattering three bets with kings the main reason being they the only hand at like 150 big blinds that you want to stack off with really is aces and depending on how you want to construct your for betting range if you want to start for betting a lot like at 200 big wines like even at 150 big blinds I'm comfortable get I had a hand in La PC actually last week where I stacked off Kings preflop for like 180 big blinds but it depends on a lot of players is this is kind of exploitative most players don't for bet wide enough and so when they do for bet it's really just aces and like Queens and it's never a bluff so when people start for bet bluffing preflop you have to stack off with ace king but against these people that never for bet or 5 bet Bluff like that's when you should stop shoveling money and with Kings not necessarily your stack.size lewis it's more does my opponent ever for bet bluff or five but bluff or is it only just aces is M ratio Darrin ass is M ratio like you're stacked to blind ratio a little bit s PR is kind of like that but M is more your stack compared to the blinds and antes versus s PR is your stack compared to the size of the pot s tan ask SPRs and multi way pots especially on turn in river situations can get complex how do you navigate them the same way as a heads up pot just the SPR is always gonna be lower in a multi-way pot so you're again like kind of the with a lower SPR you're good strong top pears become much stronger multi-way pots the SPR it's just easier to get the money in when you want to and so you're just playing it a lower SPR pot in a multi-way pot Jef Friedman and a hundred big big blind stack what are you opening to under the gun I've been inducing it using a strategy lately that's kind of counterintuitive to what a lot of people think I actually like men raise or raise really small in early position and I raise much larger in late position so in early position I might be making it like men raise I might just men raise it and then on the button I'm gonna make it like almost like I'll be raising to 3x on the button and the reason is is when I open under the gun I'm almost for sure gonna be playing the pot out of position at a very deep stack and a deep SPR so I don't want to bloat this pot where I'm gonna have a hard time playing out of position at very deep sacks so I want to keep this pot small by only men raising so versus a lot of people like 2 3 or 4 X under the gun and then a lot of players like to men raise the button but I like to 3x the button or even for exit early on on the tournament because now I'm playing a pot in position and I'm much more comfortable playing a big pot in position so it's counterintuitive but I think it's more correct that I'll raise bigger from the button in the cutoff and smaller in early position excuse me Gary blow do we three bit bluff for any buying level online not necessarily true this is a balanced approach this is kind of your baseline you want to be adjusting this baseline strategy versus your opponent if your opponent never folds to three but it's going to call your three bet with five three suitors like eight poor students so if you can just stop three betting your Bluffs and just three bit wider for value always be making adjustments to your opponent's so against a lot of opponents online and one dollar tournaments you don't need to have a three bet bluffing range you can have just a very very wide three bet value range what about Robert Roberto s what about livecast with two hundred big blinds same theory same concepts you want to be playing hands they can make flushes and straights not top pair few more questions here before we wrap it up yeah theory boy what stack size you should one either pusher fold ice typically start doing 15 be blinds your left yes 15 big blinds is this spot where I will start doing it I still do a lot of men raising off of 15 big blinds but there's certain hands that I will start jamming more than 15 I really don't do any jamming at all because I think I have a post flop edge and I want to be playing more hands Jeff Friedman so 150 big blinds deep another gun opens two three big blinds three people call I have pocket queens how many big blinds are you raising to your three bet at least 15 probably so there's an open there's 12 big blinds in the pot so I think you can make it up to like 16 to 18 big blinds somewhere in the range of 15 to 18 seems good Jonathan littell asks can you briefly discuss how to play with 100 or 250 big blind stacks when people use huge raises to ten big blinds preflop like is often the case in small stakes games so your strategy I'm gonna just be doing a lot of flat calling when someone opens to ten big blinds playing 100 or 250 big blinds and the main reason is like I don't have a lot of incentive to be three betting a hand like pocket queens when someone through opens to ten big blinds because they're already isolating the the spa a lot of the reasons you want to be three betting is to get the pot heads up so let's say middle position opens to ten big blinds and we're on the button with say pocket jacks or pocket queens our hand normally be good enough like if they open two three big blinds we would three that to ten big ones but he's already three opened it to ten big ones so we can just call now and play this pot in position without three betting because they've already made the raise big enough where we're not worried about the blinds coming in we want to play as pot heads up and that's already going to happen so you can actually almost not have a three betting range and just flat with everything including aces unless it's a complete lunatic if you three bet and he's just gonna shovel it all in with Queens or jacks then share three about aces but you don't have to I would just do a lot of calling and I would fold like I would call really tight to the ten big blind open so like I might even fold sixes and fives and fours and like six seven suited and just called my really good hands basically Ricardo asked the hand with he has pocket 7s there's 150 big blind open in the middle position a player with 85 big blank called I have a hundred big blinds on the dealer button with seven seven but the blinds have around thirty to fifty four thirty to forty big blinds should I call full they raise I would always just call here thirty to forty big blinds from the blinds it's gonna be they're gonna have to pick up a really good hand to squeeze most players don't squeeze wide enough so I wouldn't be worried about not seeing the flop there Louis what is your calling range when you have 100 big blinds versus 20 big blinds shelves pretty much the exact same if I had 40 big blinds versus a 20 big blinds shove I'm calling pretty much the same range maybe it's just a tiny bit tighter when I have 40 big blinds versus a hundred just because of what risk I'm taking Tom will there be a replay I was at work and missed most of this yes you can find the replay of this on YouTube [Music] Jeff read my ass at 50 big ones seep I'm chip leader at the table of my attorney under the gun guy James 10 big ones I pocketed sixes in middle position are you shoving folding they're calling I would fold here because we are in metal position and still have five players left to act if we were in the big blind or maybe the small blind I would call with the pocket sixes we're ahead of his jamming range but we want to be closing the action here Tom bacon do you adjust your three bet range if there's a cold call between you and the opener yes we have to adjust our range now because there's someone that put money in that likely has a really good hand just getting through these last questions have one more minute here Ricardo asked about this new single big blind ante and just kind of the adjustments what advice and analysis people over adjust their strategies the strategy really doesn't change that much at all with the single lip line and it just makes everything go quicker all right yeah KP when were your next webinar I will have one the end of the month I think the 27th somewhere around there you'll see a post about it Christopher what is the best way to start on poker coaching for plugging leaks and learning the quizzes homework training courses videos the quizzes are a good you know quick way when you only have 20 30 minutes to get some work in but the homework I think is a really good way to really get some in-depth thinking but just everything on there you should be spending you can spend a lot of time on there so Jim aren't you concerned of getting multiple colors when you men raised earlier with your big pairs or a scary screen not particularly because I think when I when you're playing 150 big blinds deep in level two of a tournament if I raise the three times the big blind or two times the big blind they're gonna call anyways you're gonna be playing a multi-way pot with your big pears or a skein or each Queen versus you're going to be like they're not folding your six seven suited most players to your 3x or your 2x it doesn't really matter to them look like a lot of people just think about the value there they don't make the proper adjustments for ray sizes so I'm just trying to minimize my disadvantage in terms of the size of the pot playing out of position [Music] trip Walker do you have any private coaching open I potentially am going to be reopening private coaching I'm not sure yet I have it yet this year you can check out Matt Affleck calm and it has an email address contact there but Trent yeah go to Matt Affleck calm and you can send an email there and I haven't made a decision yet I've just been really busy and playing a ton but are you like this webinar more like this on the coaching poker coaching site yes there's no monthly webinars and if you like this type of content you're gonna love the quizzes and the homework there's a lot of good ways to improve your your game and in the future there might be webinars only two paid members Jonathan's making some adjustments to that but all right guys that's a wrap we're at about an hour thanks for everyone thanks for the questions and I'll see you guys I think the end of the month is my next webinar but my content will be going up all month so awesome guys thank you", metadata={'source': 'XKUq3J9VeVc', 'title': 'Stack Size Adjustments in Tournament Play by Matt Affleck',

[Document(page_content="and we're good two go uh just gotta put the questions thing off to the side so it doesn't get in the way okay hello welcome to the webinar thank you for joining me my name is evan jarvis i'll be your host tonight tonight we're going to be taking a deeper look into hand selection i'm pretty excited about this presentation i've studied up a lot over the last two weeks in preparation for this presentation because much like yourself i'm a student of the game always looking to improve and so when there's a topic i want to know a lot about i go in there i go in my books i watch my videos i do my research and i put all the information together so i've learned a lot put it in here hopefully you learn a lot from it as well yeah we're going to be talking about hand selection a little bit about the things to consider so you can optimize your ranges in various situations to maximize your expected value let's go to the action and let's get stack in never gets old so first why talk about hand selection excelling at no limit hold them chapter one i wrote about the six ingredients for a winning poker game and a heavy emphasis of that was what i first popularized back in 2008 um the triple threat position aggression selection um we covered position in the first webinar a couple months ago and aggression in the second webinar last month all the replays are available on youtube and my approach to poker is about getting every advantage you can and the triple threat accounts for three of the five advantages we've talked about information advantage goes with position skill advantage with aggression and today we're going to be talking about card and range advantage and how it pairs with selection if you want to learn about the stamina physical mental advantage check out five pillars of peak performance program i did with jonathan and for the psychological advantage um get in touch that's one of my favorite things to talk about um so today we're going to be going in a car range advantage and we're also going to be talking a little bit about the betting advantage because they are closely related and if you enjoy this webinar and you want to be notified about future presentations please follow me on twitter at gripst poker i will be doing one soon on how to prepare for the world series of poker just finalizing my dates so once again pokercoaching.com so far it's been very fun uh working with the guys at poker coaching i'm very honored to be alongside these great minds been watching some of the webinars from the other creators and wow they have just been absolutely on fire what a wealth of knowledge that jonathan alex and matt are bringing to the table strongly invite you to check out the webinars if you haven't the webinar replays are available on jonathan little's youtube channel and it's just an absolute gold mine yours free if you've already watched them congratulations you are well on your way to becoming the best player you can be goals of today's presentation first we're going to talk about range construction and why thinking about it is important rather than just you know flying by the seat of your pants we're gonna talk a little bit about the concept of balancing your range then we're going to go into when and a little on y you don't always need to be perfectly balanced next we will talk about uh continuance frequency huge shout out to ed miller and james sweeney for teaching me about this really really cool concept makes a lot of sense and as we go through the slides you'll see why next we're going to talk about kind of the best hands to continue with and the various properties of different hands and finally which situations lead to favoring different properties we're going to look at the properties of the various hands and then learn how to rank them a little bit based on the situation that we're in combining points five and six is how we really choose the best hands and we learn kind of the art of range construction so first let's talk about the benefits of optimal range construction the first benefit is building your ranges enables you to play more hands in the first presentation in the series we discussed how ranges adjust as position changes and when you understand how to build your range's post flop you can do the same and play wider ranges because you'll be in more advantageous positions fedor holtz talked about this in his studies that finding out how to get the most value out of each part of your range is a major key to success at the highest levels next the second benefit is that gets you thinking about the game on a higher level and if you want to play higher stakes or against harder competition you're going to need to know how to think in terms of ranges and see the big picture you know looking at the game from a holistic perspective and kind of zooming out a little bit this is something i'm also currently working on personally so i definitely don't have this perfect i don't know many players in the world that do there are some solvers and bots that have it pretty good but you know the best thing we can do is just practice learn iterate refine and get a little bit better uh every day speaking of seeing the bigger picture building your ranges properly ensures that each hand gets its maximum expected value which is a lot of what we're trying to the poker table is maximize our ev some hands are best for big pots some are for big bluffs some are good for cheap showdowns some are for bluff catching and so on by planning ahead and building out your ranges with the bigger picture in mind you'll play each hand to the best of its ability given the properties that it has this makes you really hard to play against because your strategy becomes well balanced and pretty bulletproof or barrel proof and speaking of balance building your ranges means that you have a perfect baseline which is that you know that old theory of game theory optimal this is kind of what it moves towards um which you don't need to play in all spots because most opponents are not playing perfect but it's always helpful to know what perfect would be lastly it's not that hard at least that's what i hear no limit holdem only has 1326 combination of hands which is a lot less than you know omaha or pineapple and in most situations you'll only be playing between 10 and 50 of that amount so it's not a huge huge sample of things to rank and order and keep track of if you compare that to like stock trading where there are thousands of symbols out there to keep track of you can see that the math of poker is much simpler and more complete you just kind of know all the variables that you're working with and it's just a matter of organizing them to make the most of every situation so what exactly is range construction range construction is choosing which hands you'll take various strategic actions with at each point in a hand i first learned about this in the mathematics of poker which was absolutely awesome and that's where i learned about complex ranges so with the betting lead we have betting ranges and we have checking ranges but those ranges then split further where we have our bet folding range which maybe you do with your weakest bluffs like gut shots we have our back calling range which we would probably want to use our strong draws or strong hands in then we have our bet raising range which includes our really nutted hands that we want to try to get as much money in the pot as quickly as possible same thing with checking we check fold with our weakest hands we tend to check call our medium strength hands and check raise both the best hands and probably some bluffs too so we're incorporating the concept of balance when we bet or when we raise we don't always have it because that would be easy to play against but we have some bluffs in there too so we keep our opponents guessing it's not hard and fast those examples that i just gave but that's the beauty of it is when you plan your range you construct your range and say okay which hands would do best to my betting range which would be checking maybe i can move a hand from my bet raise range to my check raise range instead to keep things a bit more balanced and protected we'll talk about more that more as it goes on but this is the the nuts and bolts of it is taking the various ranges that you're going to have and allocating your hands accordingly both your good hands and your bad hands without the betting lead it's the same story we raise for value or as a bluff we call for showdown or with a draw when say we're getting the right pod odds or the right implied odds or as a float which is basically um you know a defensive bluff where we call with not much planning to take the pot away later because we think we're going to be getting the right odds on our bet later and finally folding which would be for our worst hands and the main key takeaway from this slide at least for me was that when you put a hand in one range you can't put it in another range at the same time so what hands you put in your betting range can't go in your checking range and that's why really looking at all your hands and thinking about which ones are going to go where really helps to ensure that your ranges are what we call protected and balanced okay yeah so next we're going to talk about why it's beneficial to balancer range the mathematics of poker that we discussed in the aggression webinar says that when we bet we offer our opponent odds or when they bet they offer us odds and your opponent's job is to play when the odds are in their favor and to pass or fold when they are not in their favor same with vice versa when you balance your range you control how often you're bluffing uh so you know they win versus value bet uh you win well typo happens sometimes and when you do it perfectly your opponent can't do anything to beat you so shaping your range the concept here is that based on the odds that you lay your opponent if you shape your range accordingly with the right amount of value bets to bluffs you make it harder for them to guess and if you do it perfectly there's no guessing they just whatever they do you know you're giving them two to one they need to win a third of the time well when they call they'll win exactly a third of the time because two times you have it one time you don't um this makes them these concepts called like indifferent with their bluff catchers so whether they whatever they do they can't beat you if they call more than they should your value bets get paid off more and if they call less than they should your bluffs benefit so by having a balance range you benefit from both sides of the spectrum if you don't do this you're easy to play against and i'm sure you've played against that type of player before you know they always have it so you just never pay them off or they never have it so you always call them really light and by balancing your range you make it much harder to play against you yeah and so i promise we talk a little bit about the golden ratio and this is what the golden ratio is so again it's based on the mathematics of we make a bet size we lay odds to our opponent and therefore there's a certain frequency uh at which they're supposed to call based on the odds they're getting and they have to win a certain percentage of the time so we balance our value to bluff ratio to ensure that we're just kind of meeting that exact mark yeah so example let's say we bet full pot lay our opponent two to one odds they need to show down a winner 33 of the time and therefore if we have two value hands and one bluff they're gonna win that one time we're bluffing and they're gonna lose the two two thirds of the time that we're value betting so we just hit that exact mark um if we that's half pot and lay them three to one they need to win a quarter of the time so we want to have the goods three quarters of the time and if we bet you know an eighth of the pot we want to have it ninety percent of the time so this is a chart that's worth knowing uh only thing to note on the value to bluff ratio is that um in the case of like two-thirds pot and a three-quarter pot one and a half x-pot and more i i rounded up the numbers two whole numbers because when you're choosing your combinations of hands you can't exactly you know have two and a third combos so to balance that out i just rounded up so we have whole numbers and you can just balance your combos accordingly so this is a really handy chart to have when designing your ranges with the bet sizes that you choose so this makes your opponent indifferent to calling with bluff catchers and whenever they fold you win the entire pot um so we we looked in the previous presentations about kind of the break even success rate for various bets and then this the golden ratio is how you can allocate your hands accordingly so that even when you do get called you're getting the best of it i hope that one if that makes sense main thing grab the chart save it it'll come in handy later and as you practice building ranges these things will click they'll make more and more sense now we talked about how to balance our ranges now when you don't need to balance your range is when you're playing against non-optimal opponents which is 99 of players and probably why ed miller's book was called poker's one percent not two or five percent so how to adjust first thing to do is categorize your opponents and their tendencies with it being situational know that some people play differently on the flop the turn the river when the pot is small when the pot is big so the more you pay attention to an opponent the more you can kind of gauge what the risk inclination how much they like to take on high risk situations or risk aversion is and then you can also gauge if they change when they're playing a big pot if they rise to the occasion or if they kind of cower away and also you can adjust for when people are stuck or they're doing really well in the game uh it's the more you know the more you're going to be able to make better decisions and adjust for your opponents so pay attention categorize your opponents and their tendencies and that will really pay off because you start with your baseline range and then you can deviate you now have numbers that you can work with for your perfectly balanced ratio and now you can adjust say if they call more than they should then you add more value back combos and maintain the same amount of bluffs or keep the same amount of value hands and decrease the amount of bluffs if they fold too much you would add more bluff combos or you would take away some of the value combos vice versa when you're facing their aggression if they bluff less than they should you would fold more of your weak hand combos your bluff catchers and if they bluff too much you would call with more of your bluff catchers or potentially even raise in the case where you have a hand that can't beat a bluff but you know they have more bluffs than they should and therefore if you raise you're you're probably going to get more folds than you need to to match your breakeven success rate and so why not go ahead and raise so this is how you can kind of adjust from that baseline range but knowing the golden ratio is very helpful because that's something you can revert to something you can always fall back on something you can rely on that is kind of safe and secure so how to add combos this is where tools like flopzilla the range tools at pokercoaching.com are really fantastic for this or you can do it the old-fashioned way writing by hand i'd love to give an example but it's very tedious and would probably take about 60 minutes to go through one hand so be a little inefficient but yeah maybe in some future study sessions we'll dive deep into that because it's it's a fun thing to work through now the question is how much is too little or too much right i've thrown these things out there you know too much too little and you're like well relative to what based on what and that's where minimum defense frequency comes in um this is here's the minimum defense frequency it's a concept that is often misunderstood um we spoke in the aggression webinar about the thresholds for profitable bets where if our opponent folds at a certain frequency based on the bet size we chose we're going to make profit no matter what our cards are and the minimum defense frequency is that other side of the equation where if we're defending less than the minimum defense frequency our opponent can be in those situations where they can profit just from their betting and their cards don't matter if however we're meeting the minimum defense frequency now they have to actually show up with a well-constructed range to find profit from the situation so the idea behind this chart is that we're preventing our opponent from creating profit or quote unquote auto profiting by betting any two cards now a couple things about this chart um a few things actually the first is that this chart is for heads-up pots in the case where you're playing a multi-way pot the minimum defense frequency is shared by all players in the hand so if someone bets full pot into two opponents and the minimum defense frequency is 50 percent if either opponent defends at least 25 percent of time you're meeting that minimum defense frequency next is that this chart assumes that both players have equally strong ranges and equal equity when continuing if you're in a situation where your opponent's range is you know stronger than yours because maybe he raised from early position and you defended the big blind you don't have to defend as much as this minimum defense frequency or if you're in a situation where your range is stronger than your opponents because you constructed your range more intelligently than they did you can continue with more hands than the minimum defense frequency and expect to show a profit and this is where building your ranges in an intelligent way makes all the difference the more intelligently you build your range the more equity you will have as the hand progresses whereas the less intelligently you build your range the less equity you'll have and so building your range effectively is a big edge that you can have now that's that's the kind of info about this chart and i would say don't get up don't get caught up too much in the specifics of it because it's very theoretical and it's assumes average board it assumes equal strength ranges it assumes an average board um certain boards favor imposition players certain boards favor out of position players so this is just in the whole spectrum if all things were equal this is how much we should defend based on the bet size we can then deviate from here but it's good to know these numbers just have a baseline the numbers i found really helpful were when facing a quarter pop bat we want to be defending a huge percentage of our range and this may mean that we're defending some very weak hands but also keep in mind when your opponent that's a quarter of the pot you don't have to win that pot very often to show profit on your call and that's why we want to defend more and more hands and it's about picking the best hands of the ones we defend uh and also when facing an over bet we don't have to defend that often to keep our opponent from making an automatic profit so that's those are the biggest takeaways i got from this chart but i just found it really useful to see this chart with all the numbers in front of me to be like okay this is about what i should shoot for on average in terms of what percentage of my range i'm continuing with and now knowing that it's my job to choose the best hands of the ones that i continue with so again it's the inverse of this familiar chart from our regression webinar which was the break-even success rate of the better without cards and again pot equity the better you build your range um the the less these numbers even need to be so just building your range as well as just giving you a huge bonus a huge rebate on everything else that you do at the poker table cool it's choosing the best hands to play pre-flop i've got a little little graphic showing a couple of different types of ranges on the left we have a linear range and on the right we have a polarized range i made both these ranges using the poker coaching range creator really good tool um first time using it and definitely going to be using it again in the future so the difference between these two ranges they're both about the same percentage of hands about 15 percent of hands and on the left we have a linear range which means the best hands from top to bottom is how we choose our hands this is the type of range that we're usually going to use in a defending situation so for example if we're calling a river bet and showing down or if we're re-jamming pre-flop and for the times we get called we just want to have the hands with the highest equity or if we're say three betting out of position and having to play the hand out of position for the rest of the hand we want you know a nice linear strong range whereas on the right side where we have the polarized range which has those best hands you know nines plus ace jack plus each jack suited plus the suit of broadways but then it has the hands on the bottom of the spectrum that didn't quite make the linear range so the deuces through fours the lower suited aces the lower suited kings these hands and the suited connectors that they have some nice properties to them the suited aces can make not flush draws they can make nut flushes they also have the blockers of the ace which decreases the chance that our opponent has an ace the suited kings can make the king high flush and also these hands have the ability to make top pair one way and then our drawing hands have the ability to still make sets and straights now a polarized range is used more for aggressing as opposed to defending because with aggressing we can win when our opponents fold to our bet and what did we learn last webinar that the weakest hands those with the least equity benefit the most from getting their opponents to fold so we throw these hands in here because they benefit the most from getting the opponents to fold and we'd rather use you know the ace 10 suited through a6 and the suited 9x and the ace 10s to call so this is where if we're gonna have a calling range and a raising range and we want to have some good hands in the calling range we raise the best hands call with the next best hands three bet as a bluff with the next best hands and then fold the worst hands that's kind of some basics of pre-flop range construction so when building a range we want some value hands and some bluffs uh when we're playing you know with with the aggression and especially if there's going to be multiple streets of betting and this is an example of a pre-flop range with both now if were playing against an opponent who never folded there'd be no need to include the bluffs we would just use the linear range whereas if there was an opponent who folded all the time to bluffs we may add more of the um weaker hands to the mix because they'll benefit even more from just getting the opponent to fold on later streets and we'd be better off playing them as bluffs than playing them as folds because our opponent folds too much so that's kind of adding in an exploit and a counter in how we can construct our ranges to plan for the opportunity to take advantage of that weakness in our opponent's strategy and it's the same post flop which is why opponent tendencies are so important they affect how you should shape your range hope that makes sense so choosing the best hands to play pre-flop we have our tier one hands which are our big pairs and our big suited aces suited broadways tier two hands which are our medium pocket pairs suited aces and suited connectors suited broadways in our tier three hands we have our smaller pocket pairs suit connectors and offsuit broadways and then tier four suited connectors through the gap pursuit kings tier v suit two gappers queens and jacks and the the key with these hands is the properties of them um the better hands pre-flop will make better hands post flop and with these tier one hands when they flop a set it's gonna be top set on a lot of boards they're gonna have over pairs and if they flop top pair it's gonna be top pair close top pair top kicker most of the time if they make a flush it's going to be the not flush or in worst case the second knot flush so these hands when they hit the flop they'll have the best of it on the flop and we can play them for a big pot whereas the tier two hands if they flop a set it's more often mid-set not as often top set with the suited aces it's top pair if they flop an ace but it's not top pair great kicker and they do have the ability to make the nut flush draw which what makes them top tier hands and the suit the jack 10 suiteds and up uh can make really strong straights and then as we go down we have hands that can make sets but they'll make bottom sets or we'll have hands that can make straights but they won't be the nut straights and flushes that won't be the nut flushes so we have to be more cautious with them we can't exactly just get all our money in when we make a nine high flush but we can get all our money in with an ace high flush no matter how many big blinds we have so look at the concept of implied odds the tier the top tier hands have higher implied odds and the lower tier hands have more reverse imply dots they can't really play big pots and then the mid tier ends or everything in between um as for the tier four hands suited kings get in here because the king can make top pair plus they can make the second knot flush um which can be played you know for a medium-sized pop but it just can't be played quite as confidently as an ace there's a huge difference between the nuts and the second nuts you know the nuts and everything else the nuts can play for all the money at any time the second nuts and down can't they have to be more selective so key properties again just to review the best hands have the ability to make top pair top set top boat not flush not straight great hands have the ability to flop a set or combo draws they won't necessarily be nut draws but they'll be draws that have lots of equity high chance of making the best hand versus a made hand and then good hands have the ability to make a marginal draw or top pair that can play for some amount of money some some amount of streets of betting but not all the streets of betting post flop key questions for choosing the best hands first look at the math preflop and post flop and based on that what odds are you getting what percentage of hands do you want to continue with when it comes to which hands to open uh jonathan's got some great charts for that on pokercoaching.com it's one of the resources you get as a member and then when facing an open that's when you look at your opponent's range what percentage of hands is he playing can you exploit him post flop if so you want to play more hands is he pretty solid post flop so you want to just play the same amount of hands as him and based on that you choose what percent of hands you want to continue with also their post-flop tendencies really matter how do they react to aggression what's their fault to three bet their flop raise full to flop rays fold on later streets etc just the more you can profile your opponent the more you can justify widening your range and play more hands because you know where you can you know make your move on them and put the pressure on and find a profitable bet second is determining what hands you want to use to make up that percentage so if you know you want to play 10 of hands what is the best 10 percent of hands to play given the situation next do you have to consider another range if so you know for your 10 raise range you might not want to do the top 10 percent of hands maybe you want to do the top seven percent of hands call with five percent and then the next three percent you raise so if you have to consider another range you can't just put all the best hands into one range you want to spread them out over two to ensure that both your ranges can withstand pressure on later streets this is called protecting your range fourth is are there more cards to come if that's the case then having draws go up in value having equity goes up in value having outs goes up in value and how deep are you if you're really deep then those nut draws go up in value and if you're super deep um the draws that make you the nuts and make your opponent a strong second best hand go up in value that's when you get really nitty gritty with the hand selection um yeah and it's how deep are you and how likely is the money to go in the middle you know because just because you have 500 big blinds in front of you if the pot has five blinds um in it on the turn it's unlikely that all those 500 bigs are going in on the river you know it's 100x pot which brings us to pot to stack ratio which is the concept that helps us recognize what is the likelihood of a lot of money going into the pot so to figure out pot stack ratio what is it it's exactly what it sounds like you take how much is in the pot take how much is in the effective stack and you create a ratio it's another concept that matt affleck talked about in one of his webinars so for example you're playing a one two no limit game small blind raises to ten big blind calls pots twenty dollars you both started the hand with 200 you have 190 behind your pot stack ratio 9.5 if on the other hand your opponent started the hand with 70 so the effective stack is 70. uh once you raise 10 get called 10 the pot is 20 60 behind the pot stack ratio is 30 there's three makes sense great now the question is why is this important it has to do with how we plan our hands if you watch the position webinar then you'll recall this graphic which shows how the pots grow from street to street with them getting bigger and bigger as we get later and later and when we're going to be playing uh big pot on the river we want to have a strong range to prepare for that so this is where the pot stack ratio really comes in um it's it's how we it's how we plan our hands so if the money is going to go all in on the current street if the next bet is all in that would be a pot stack ratio of one assuming a pot size bet we want hands that can win at showdown in other words we want to be playing our strongest hands probably want to be playing that kind of linear range if we're calling if we're betting we can i'll talk about it in two slides if the pot stack ratio is four which means we have basically two pot size bets left because the first pot size the first pot bed is one and then when called by the opponent there's now three in the middle and next plot size bet is three which gets us all in so a pot stack ratio of four means that most of money will go in on the next street and so in that case in addition to hands that could win at showdown we want hands that can improve to strong hands so think draws lots of equity many outs and if the money is going to go in on a way future street like the river we want hands that can improve to strong hands um we want the hands that can improve to nut hands and it gets even more pronounced as we get deeper so with that pot stack ratio 40 where it would now take uh three streets of betting and a raise to get all the money in you're really going to need a cooler situation you want to be preparing to have hands that can play a big pot on the river uh where your opponent will make a second best hand trying to think an example of that would be like um what's a good one king nine five board [Music] yeah if you have jack ten on king nine five and you make a straight by hitting a queen there's a good chance your opponent's made two pair with king queen and you'll be able to get a lot of action in that spot uh whereas if you have eight seven on that board king nine five and you make your gut shot by hitting a six your opponent's not gonna have as many combinations of five six for two pair as they would uh king queen for two pair and so that's that's kind of again the nitty-gritty of it of seeing not only how many outs does your hand have um but how how how likely is it to win a setup on a later street um so the stacks get deep we want to plan for those later streets but when stacks are shallow we don't need to worry about those cooler situations on later streets so depending on our pot stack ratio different properties of hands become more important um and so here's just a quick breakdown of it again as a reminder so first we check how many streets of bed are left pot start ratio check when the pot stack ratio is one we plan for right now one raw hand strength and showdown value pot stack ratio is two to four we want to plan for the next three that's where outs and equity become important when the pot stack ratio is 5 to 13 we want to start planning for two streets from now which is where nut potential is important and with 14 to 40 pot stack ratio assuming pot size bets want to plant for three streets from now where the implied odds and reverse implied odds so really getting those set up situations becomes important i know it's like really really complex stuff this range construction stuff so choosing the best hands to play post flop here are the properties to consider for each hand the more of these a hand has the better so we have absolute hand strength that's kind of looking at your hand on a hand chart you know do i have trips to pairs straights flushes flush draw open ender combo draw next we have equity which is your chance of winning versus your opponent's range think outs easy way to do this is to throw a hand into a equity calculator plug in their range plug in your hand and you'll get your equity against them future equity is chance of winning if the pot gets big so instead of thinking of quantity of outs think of the quality of the outs that you have if i hit my out do i have the nuts or could i have the second best hand um if i hit my hand is my opponent likely to make a second best hand or are they likely to just have a marginal hand they can't give a lot of action anyway if i try to play a big pot next we have backdoor potential which is a bonus because you pick up extra equity when you have a backdoor draw so three to a flush draw is better than no draw and three to a straight draw is better than three to a gut shot in terms of bonus equity showdown value is your chance of winning unimproved vulnerability versus resiliency how many cards can make you second best so an example of this would be like again on that king 9 5 board um pocket queens versus pocket tens tens are more vulnerable because the jack and queen can both make a better pair hand than the tens whereas with queens there's no extra outs that can make a better pair i mean both of them are equally vulnerable to an ace so we'd be more inclined to bet with the tens and more inclined to check with the queens so if your hand is vulnerable you need more protection that's a good reason to bet another example would be top pair top kicker on 8 3 deuce versus king 3 deuce despite the fact that both hands are the same absolute hand strength top pair top kicker the eight the pair of eights is much more vulnerable because there are more over cards that can come there are more outs that their opponent can have against them and then lastly blockers do you have cards that can alter their range um common example is if you have an ace in your hand it's less likely your opponent has an ace in their hand so you block the best hands whereas if you have like a deuce in your hand your opponent can't have a deuce so they'll have more strong hands because they won't have twos and these are just all the different properties that a hand can have the more of these properties a hand has the stronger the hand is the less they have the weaker the hand is and that's kind of how we put our hands on a scale it's not just what is my absolute hand strength there are more factors to consider and the more of them you consider when choosing your hands the more effectively you can construct your ranges and so when looking at your hands you want to ask to have a value hand semi bluff or pure bluff because when we're talking about balancing our value range and our bluffing range semi-bluffs are better to have than pure bluffs and we want to have a mix of both so here's a little way to visualize hands after the flop first we have our nut hands which are hands that we're ready to play for three streets of value these are best hands we want to go bet that bet with these and we want to pair those with our nut draws these are the hands that have that high future equity and probably a good amount of equity as well and we have our strong made hands which are probably best for two bets but if we bet three streets and really reduce our opponent's range too much they're no longer going to be the best hand and we pair that with our strong draws these would be hands that have high equity but maybe not a lot of high future equity or hands that have say good showdown value like you know a pair and a draw would be something that would probably fit into a strong draw that we don't want to play for all the streets um but we are comfortable playing for a couple and we have our weak made hands which we're just looking to play for one street and our weak draws and finally our air trash which we don't want to play any streets of bedding with these hands these are the hands that just go into our check folding range right out of the gate and here's a little way to visualize it we're going to have mostly you know we're gonna have more air hands than nut hands and the way i approach it is on the early streets you know i'm probably gonna bat all the hands that are yellow and green and then as i move to the turn i i lop off the weakest hands the weekends weak draws continue with the strong ones and then on the river uh lop off the strong ones and just continue with the nut hands and the nut draws so the more streets of bedding i'm going through whether i'm betting or being bet into the narrower my range gets and the stronger it gets while still containing some draws in it as well and so a hand is one with showdown value stars are semi bluffs two stars are two bluffs and yeah because i know this goes like can be a little actually can be very overwhelming at first and like examples can be really needed so for more on this i'd say check out the work of ed miller or james sweeney because they take you really deep into this with hand examples and get more nitty gritty for this presentation i wanted to introduce the key concepts to be considering and give you kind of the broad strokes the overarching picture the holistics of all the things to consider and then for getting nitty gritty we can work on it more specifically in the future or you can check out those materials which will give you examples to really have it click how to rake hands on the river which is a unique situation because on the river what's different is we don't have any draws anymore we don't have any semi-bluffs anymore so on the previous slide we had the full pyramid and i mentioned how we remove hands as we move through the streets and up the pyramid and so on the last street we just have the top of the pyramid we have our value bets that wear our nuts the whole way we have our draws that didn't improve our draws that didn't prove became value bets and then we have the hands in the middle you know those two street hands which we have a showdown hands and in this situation is a time where we can now benefit from betting a polarized range um the reason being that you know we looked at the golden ratio we want our value bets and our bluffs to be aligned and our bluffs our hands that can't win at showdown are the ones that benefit the most from getting our opponent to fold whereas our hands that come in on showdown can benefit from check calling because they can win at showdown a good example of this is if we bet the river whether we're value betting or bluffing and get raised we can continue with our value hands and we can fold with our bluffs easy but if we bet a hand that has showdown value and we have to fold to a raise we may be folding a hand that could have won the potter fit it checked and so our checking hands are that are kind of the middle of our range we usually want to be checked on the river so we can show it down and the worst hands will want to be bet because they're the ones that benefit the most from bluffing the river the key in this situation is to look at the bet size that you're choosing and figure out how many bluffs you need to have to match that so you see how many value bets do i have what bet size am i choosing and how many bluffs do i need to balance that out and when you combine those two things you'll have that perfect ratio and yeah so value bets can be 50 of the calling range bluffs will not win at showdown and everything else is what falls between it can beat it can beat a portion of the range but it won't beat fifty percent of their calling range okay i'm going to rock through a little checklist for planning your hand versus a perfect opponent first ask what does my range look like second ask how many streets do i want to play with each hand so putting the hands into the buckets then third what bet size will i be using and based on that how many value bets you have and what bet size using you can figure out how many bluffs you need to balance your range then fifth once you know kind of what frequencies you're going for how many hands you need how many combos you need then you choose the best candidates to fill those ranges out and finally ask is my checking range protected you don't want to put all your good hands in your betting range because then your checking range is weak in your opponents if they're thinking players can take advantage of that which a perfect opponent is but fortunately we're not playing against perfect opponents we're playing against human opponents who are going to make mistakes myself included so in this case checklist i go through is ask how does my opponent play pre-flop because their tendencies are what's really going to dictate uh the best strategy for you do they play perfect do they play too loose do they play tight and then look at the post flop tendencies on what street are they in balance do they see bet the flop too much and then give up on the turn do they not bet the flop enough yeah did they bet the flop in the turn too much but give up on the river or do they triple barrel too much and based on where they are imbalanced you can build your range in such a way that you can get to that situation more often and then take advantage of it third is do i need to be concerned with balance um if the answer is yes you know they're playing pretty solidly you want to balance your range if you don't need to be concerned with balance you can [Music] completely adjust your range by going unbalanced so if they call too much you can value bet more hands or you can choose a bigger bet size to get more value when you do get called if they call too little or fold too easily you can include more bluffs in your range or you can choose a ball smaller bet size with more of your hands since they're folding more than they should and you can risk less for the times they actually wake up with a hand that's number five is there a better bet size to accomplish my goal and based on that can you build multiple ranges with multiple bet sizes to accomplish your various goals in various situations provided your opponent is not going to adjust to that so the less concerned your opponent is with your hand and your range uh the more creative you can get with this and the more savvy your opponent is the more thinking your opponent is the more you want to focus stick to having balanced ranges in pretty much all situations okay summary that was a lot of material that's a lot of material if you if it didn't all click don't sweat it um can re-watch the replay on youtube and also i mentioned the resources that you can use to go deeper in and also uh matt affleck and his most recent webinar did a couple of really good hand examples on range construction so you can actually see it in action which i know really helps to solidify it uh just as i said we're we're almost an hour without even having examples so that would have been like two hours without the q a apologies if i threw a little bit too much info out there i was just really excited about the material i was studying i kind of wanted to put all together and um gave my best shot so in summary what we learned today is that building and planning your ranges allows you to play more hands and realize more expected value from each hand in the ranges two makes you hard to play against and makes it easier for you to play because you are preparing for the future situations that you're going to find yourself in so you know your ranges are protected and you have strong hands for big pots three range construction is allocating your combos to different ranges and different lines thinking about what am i betting three streets with what am i betting two streets with when i'm betting two streets and my bet check betting am i bet bet checking am i check that betting and that will depend on pot size type of hand type of opponent implied odds etc for against perfect opponents we want to be balanced with our value to bluff ratio based on bet size that's that golden ratio which you can consult the chart anytime you like five against imperfect opponents we can deviate to exploit their imbalance uh in his book poker's one percent ed miller says you want to follow these rules of having solid ranges and solid frequencies but when someone breaks the rules you're welcome to break them too so if someone is not playing an optimal strategy and you recognize where that imbalance is you can adjust your ranges and your balance of value to bluff to take advantage of it six minimum defense frequency tells us how much to continue based on bet size and range versus range equity seven playing while pre-flop makes it easier to play well post flop and playing while on the flop makes it easier to play while on the river eat as the hand progresses slowly let go of hands and continue appropriately based on your opponent's bet size and range so we had that pyramid from three slides ago and we talked about how we as we move through the hands and we face more betting and we reduce our range and we refine our range we lop off the weakest hands and only continue with the better hands the prime candidates and when facing a bigger bet size we drop off more of the hands and when facing a smaller bet size we drop off fewer of the hands to meet that minimum defense frequency nine when shallow think showdown value when deep think equity and when super deep think nut potential and 10 on the river with hands on the river hands with no showdown value benefit the most from bluffing and hands with showdown value should usually be put into your check and calling range okay and that's my presentation on hand selection and the things to consider to help start structuring your ranges to make you really hard to play against if you want to learn more about range construction see learn it in action and learn from other coaches who are doing the same pokercoaching.com awesome place to do it i've really in been really impressed with all the webinars that have been coming out from alex and matt and jonathan and also the hand quizzes are just they're so they're so helpful for learning because it really it's the closest thing you can get to playing poker without playing poker and to be engaged in the action to make decisions in the moment you know be put under pressure to make decisions and get instant feedback on your play um many studies say that the best way to improve at something is to get immediate feedback when you take an action and these hand quizzes are the best way to get that feedback other than hiring a private coach which is very expensive so i'm a huge fan of pokercoaching.com uh the hand quizzes and the webinars and also you know the range tools that they have jonathan just keeps adding new stuff all the time he's really gone out of his way to make the most complete training program out there when you sign up for pokercoach.com you'll also get access to float the term for free which is a lot of extra videos and actually listen to a podcast from jonathan today that guy might be the hardest working guy in the industry just so much so much respect to him for just constant constant grinding work ethic always looking to improve always looking to help his customers always looking to meet the requests that are brought to him and that's how we built up a library of 786 poker videos poker coaching has a seven day free trial as you said in the podcast go ahead sign up binge it if you don't want to pay cancel after seven days you don't mind um odds are you're probably gonna enjoy it you're probably gonna stick with it uh it's it's just a great program and with that we'll get into the questions part of the presentation and um as i mentioned i'm probably going to be doing a webinar on the world series of poker how to plan your trip to the world series of poker and how to just get the most out of your time there and you know conserve your energy save money all the keys you know the things that you wouldn't think of in terms of how to give yourself the best advantage so it's going to be about energy management focus cutting out distractions saving money cutting down on stress all those things i've been going to the world series for wow i think this will be my 12th year going to the world series i started going in 2008 and i've learned a lot uh from being in vegas and so that's a topic that i know like the back of my hand um unlike range construction is one that i know some about but when we get into the deep theory some of it i'm like like man this is this is tough dense stuff but when it comes to trip planning and where to stay where to play how to get in the zone all that stuff that's where i really shine so i'm gonna be doing a presentation on that not sure when but if you want to update on that follow grips poker on twitter and you'll be informed okay chris says it all clicked nice presentation thank you awesome chuck says i don't know what to ask i'll have to review the replay first awesome dude you can just if you post a question in the comment section of the replay on jonathan's youtube or my youtube i will be in there to give you an answer uh for sure uh great presentation evan is position key with pre-flop and post-flop strategies from this lesson yeah so so it's kind of like a three-step system so step one is play hands in position because you're gonna get the information advantage step two is choose the right betting size based on what you want to accomplish and then step three is choose the range of hands that you want to use based on the bet size that you chose so this is kind of the last step in three so position gives you the first edge bet size gives you the second edge and then hand selection gives you the third edge and ensures that you get the most out of your betting and position advantage kevin says where to access the replay jonathan little's youtube channel will be uh the place to access it first i think he's super fast he'll probably upload it like tomorrow richard says thanks evan almost skipped this webinar so glad i did not thanks for the excellent material okay so you so this stuff was clicking for you guys this was making sense because i i went through it four times and each time i'm like man i hope i'm going to be able to to communicate it really well because it's it's tough stuff but jonathan says thank you very very informative well after you watch it on youtube i found with this stuff like that that hearing getting access to the overarching theory multiple times was really key and then i was able to dive deeper because i saw how it all fit together and that's why i wanted to cover as much of it as possible to give you the big picture rather than dialing in on one area and having that be the entire presentation so i hope that that was appreciated bob harmon says thank you great info on here chuck says thanks evan um oh man this is awesome thanks guys gary says great material appliance material is what separates casual versus better player must admit i'll have to watch again uh where to find the aflac webinar also on jonathan little's youtube channel great place to go thanks okay sort of a bit new too but we'll get there thanks and also guys i'm gonna be practicing this myself because i'm i'm now in the process of working on my game in preparation for the world series so i'm gonna be going through these sorts of analysis and doing examples and i'll probably share those on my channel as i get more smooth with them so i know that there will be lots of examples coming in the future to help this stuff sink in and help it click for you john's going down for the big 50 on sunday good luck brother will you be playing any of the tournaments this next week no i'm not going to go down to the world series just yet i have not decided when i'm going to go down but there are some some orders of business i want to take care of before i go i want to get things running smooth with grips and i think poker coaching i'm set but i want to get things running with grips i want to get some steady stuff going on youtube and my nephew has his birthday in mid-june so i probably want to be home for that and after that's done i'll probably head down to the world series get my grind on right now i'm in a process of cultivating energy rather than expending energy and given the long days that tournaments are um i'm gonna i'm gonna save my energy for the big tournaments at the end and just i live on the east coast so travel time also takes a toll and you know hotel living versus home living i'm i'm just i'm going to wait for it i'm going to wait for it when it feels right you'll see me there okay thanks evan really appreciate all the work you're putting in for us yeah thanks guys thanks came in late but it's a great refresher add some more numbers to try to integrate sweet sweet i think a click for me was pre-flop linear as a lead post lop pre-flop linear as lead pre-flop polar is three bat yeah it's just when you expect to have a good amount of fold equity having a polarized range benefits and early on early on in hand you can have more bluffs than you can later in a hand too because you can give up with those bluffs as the hand progresses so kind of on the river you'll have the least bluffs followed by more bluffs on the turn followed by the most bluffs on the flop with the same amount of value hands right and then on the turn you'll have you know same value hands but less bluffs and then on the river you'll have the least bluffs thanks alex thank you angelo that says hopefully helpful comment evan i know you are enthused about the subject work on the verbal presentation vocal inflection is important to maintain concentration during what is summit bland but important yeah great great point pat i appreciate that that feedback that yeah to get people to really stay focused use the inflection to hammer down points um i will say of the triple threat this is the section i'm the least seasoned in and that's probably why i didn't have quite the same intonation that i did on the position section and the aggression section but that's where the practice and the reps will come in and next time we talk about selection i'll give i'll give you that vocal inflection to really hammer it home thank you thank you for the feedback pat i appreciate it here says thanks having a good job trying to communicate a difficult subject this is way more info than i expected i'll have to go back and review again and again yeah sorry i might it was more slides before i cut it i cut out like half the slides i had i really got it i really gotta slow down on the trying to over deliver oh man good luck with the range building carlo um kevin said good job allows review for me but made me easy made me realize other players are studying gg kevin if you're working on this stuff you are way ahead of the game you're in the top percentile this is when you're getting nitty-gritty on range construction you're in the top so trust me you're way ahead of the game if you're on that and a lot of people are way behind you do i offer one-on-one coaching ask jeff yes i do uh info is available at my website gripst.com or jeff if you want to tweet me i'll happily give you a direct link with the info for coaching cool mike glad you enjoyed it stanislav good luck in the big 50 on thursday happy stacking dean great question how often do i meditate daily and uh on days like today where i'm really pouring a lot of extra energy into computer work preparing slides and whatnot i got three sessions in today yeah when i'm when i'm at my best i'm meditating twice a day i always try to get in at least one and when i feel that i need to just really build up energy reserves and build up you know some call it prana some call it cheese some call it oregon um some just call it energy i'll meditate more because every time that we go within we shut out the world we're cultivating energy we're charging the battery whereas every time the senses are exposed to the world we're draining the battery we're draining that energy even if it's at a slow rates we're doing something enjoyable we're at a high rate because we're doing something stressful we are draining the battery and the easiest way to recharge the battery other than sleep is to sit in silent contemplation in a peaceful environment and just breathe okay what's the best defense if someone seems to be using your calculations against you um joel that's where you can you can fall back on the golden ratio you can just play a perfectly balanced range in which case they can't exploit you um that would be the best best defense revert back to just a perfectly balanced strategy um yeah where when you're betting you have the right amount of value to bluffs based on the odds you're laying your opponent and when your opponent is betting against you continue with the right amount of hands based on that minimum defense frequency and then just choose the best hands when you really get nitty-gritty into ranges and you look at them from all the angles that we talked about you know the absolute hand strength equity future equity back door draws showdown value vulnerability versus um what word did i use resiliency yeah and blockers and you're just choosing the best hands that's the defense that is the defense and then yeah if you think they're adjusting you can try to play the guessing game but if you just revert to a solid strategy that's balanced there's nothing they can really do to take advantage of you so i would just say do more practice do more study away from the table do more homework and be ready how do we make adjustments when we're in multi-way pots play tighter ranges in general play better hands be more rigid with your hands that you continue with because you know that minimum defense frequency is shared and also be more selective with the hands that you bet because when you have two opponents instead of one it's less likely both people are going to fault and therefore you're not going to hit the breakeven success frequency break even success ratio as much too many too many theoretical terms today man sorry y'all um you're less likely to meet that break-even success rate and therefore you need higher equity you need better hands so i would just say play tighter and more selectively in multi-way pots yeah i i agree pat i'll get some examples in the next one i felt when i was making the presentation like i need some examples then i put an example i'm like that's going to take 20 minutes so i i had a compromise yes fritz totally um with the pyramid graph to show combos that's where i like james james sweeney's work he does a really good job of visualizing the pyramid um he's got a he's got a whole course on uh the one percent which worth investing if you're really serious about your game jl usually recommends a two to one value to bluff ratio value bluff bluff value bluff bluff in terms or fritz can you type that again as i catch up should you only bluff with deep stacks no um you can bluff with shallow stacks too it's just when you're bluffing with deeper stacks you would prefer to have equity and when you're bluffing with really deep stacks you want hands that can make the nuts so with really deep stacks you want to think about implied odds versus reverse implied odds can you will you make the nuts for the second second nuts with medium depth stacks uh you'd like to have as many outs and equity as possible with your bluffs and then with shallow stacks where you don't think about equity blockers would be the consideration if you are bluffing ideally you would want to have hands that block uh your opponent's calling range so on a like you know queen 7-2 board having a king in your hand is a good blocker because it decreases the times your opponent has queen king which is one of the hands that he's going to call you with maybe even having a jack in your hand helps because it blocks queen jack that's it but again that's that's when you get really nitty-gritty and granular and like i said james course is about six hours maybe eight hours breaking that down so get pretty deep there but yeah you you want to bluff all the time you kind of want to have bluffs in all ranges uh your one barreling range two barely range three barely range it's just which hands are best to use as bluffs in which situations that really leads to um good range construction okay ace is m great to understand theory another thing to put all our practice in the moment appreciate the material dude thanks for tuning in man appreciate you being here um cool fritz uh interesting thing actually for the two to one value bluff to value ratio in the work of matthew johnda on the river he suggested two to two value for one bluff on the turn one value for one bluff and on the flop one value for two bluffs and then if you were to take it one street further it would be one value to four bluff so that's one way to look at it and the other thing is if you're doing a different bet size you would have a different value to bluff ratio uh key though is your passion comes through and we truly appreciate it thanks john man i appreciate that comment a lot i appreciate that comment a lot uh jeff kim t-y how many buy-ins should you play when playing cash games depends if you're professional or part-time um and what you're risk tolerant how comfortable are you i would basically say that when you're playing if you feel nervous or uncomfortable you're probably playing um with too few buy-ins or two high-stakes if you feel bored then you're playing with too many buy-ins or two small stakes so it should really be a feeling thing and also um yeah feeling is one how you can tell if you're playing too big too small and and um in terms of like just average if if you're playing part-time it's really up to you if you can reload it's really up to you and if you're playing full time i know probably like 50 to 100 buy-ins to be safe but you can play as aggressively or as conservatively with your bankroll as possible it really depends on what environments you thrive in uh fritz i submitted homework for jail no okay um maybe maybe i'll check with jonathan about that because he has more experience than i when it comes to that um range construction and he's pretty obsessive with it uh dean it's amazing when you tap your source yes feel that you're stronger than your opponent feel like you're stronger than your opponent should you steer away from coin flip situations in a cash game yes in a tournament depends on the structure uh if the structure is very fast um sometimes you can't really wait for a better spot if you're getting profitable odds you should run the carts but if the structure is really good or you have a lot of time then yeah you should definitely avoid coin flip situations because you know if you can have a 55 45 edge on someone you know in a coin flip um is that bigger than the edge you'll have if you you know make them play flops turns and rivers against you like that's why hellmuth never wants to take coin flips because he thinks with his reads um and his ability to kind of assess where other people are at he probably thinks his edge on people is 60 70 80 which may be a little absurdly high but that's kind of the idea so if if you think you're stronger than your opponent if you have a good read on him you want to avoid coin flips and close spots with them because that gives them a chance to get lucky and when you have an edge on something you want to take as much luck out of the equation as possible thanks for tuning in good luck with the homework fritz appreciate you being here um and keep studying man keeping on top of your game um feel free to to tag me in your homework with jonathan so he he can check in with me too i'd like to get his feedback he's a pretty sharp dude joel says should i avoid bluffing against multi-way pots or multiple pots and ins generally yes generally generally yes more opponents that are in there the less you should want to bluff get semi-bluff if you have the right hands you know if you have uh a nut flush draw nothing wrong with building a pot especially where people are gonna call with worse straws um but if you're pure bluffing like you have no hand and no draw and then uh the more opponents you have the less inclined you should do that uh you should be giving up a lot of hands when uh you're in a four or five-way pot craig is playing the big 50 on sunday first wsop appearance can you share a sneak okay cool um can you share a sneak peek from your upcoming wsop webinar first timer could benefit from craig how long are you going to vegas for and what is the biggest tournament you've played prior to this because i think the the main thing i would offer is don't put too much pressure on yourself yes it's your first time playing at the wsop awesome congratulations on making it down there um but if you hype it up too much okay cool so 300 you've played now you're playing a five um if you hype it up too much you probably won't bring your best game right whereas if you treat it like it's um you know if you approach it with the same mindset that you approach your usual 300 tournaments and you say okay yes the world series poker but i am just playing another tournament yes the 500 tournament but the play is probably going to be similar to my 300 tournament you have confidence in yourself and you trust in yourself you're going to be able to play your best game the most important thing when playing poker tournaments is trusting yourself being confident in yourself and believing in yourself because that's what's going to bring out your intuition it's what's going to bring out your reads it's what's going to bring out your instincts if you're nervous you're tense you've hyped it up too much or you put too much pressure on yourself you're going to be blocked from that intuition you may start doubting your decisions and then there's a downward spiral of that so really trusting your skill set believe in yourself and that way you can play your best game and then also recognize that where you finish in the tournament is largely outside your control you're going to play your best game and that's what you can focus on but where you finish will be a combination of that and how your luck is on that day so focus on what you can control which is your decision making your confidence in yourself your belief in yourself and forget about what you can't which is um you know what cards you're going to get whether you're going to win a race whether you're going to cool your opponent etc play it one hand at a time focus on what you can control trust in yourself and enjoy the experience take your time to get comfortable plan your food ahead of time because especially during that tournament it's going to be a crap show at the rio and ideally you know you want to be able to spend breaks on your own time to recharge and you know eat in a peaceful environment and all that if you're caught up in the rush on breaks and you know not knowing where to eat and whatnot it's going to drain a lot of your energy it's going to waste a lot of your decision-making power that you'd rather have for the poker tables so take some time to get comfortable figure out what your food options are plan that out make sure that's taken care of so that you can have all your energy when it's time to play to focus on poker and making decisions at the tables hope that helps and i wish you all the best at the world series of poker crack my pleasure my pleasure uh chuck says if i bust out what a bad beat only on a bad beat at the big 50 during the first x levels should i rebuy um okay few things to consider with that chuck first is do you believe you can play the stack size well that you'll be starting with so look at the blinds before you re-enter and say can i play that stock size well the answer is yes that's a point for re-entering if the answer is no it's a point for not re-entering um and then second is am i emotionally affected from getting knocked out if the answer is yes that's the point for no if the answer is no that's a point for yes and the last question i would ask is am i re-entering to chase my first buy-in and try to you know get back to even or am i re-entering because i legitimately feel like i can play my best poker i i feel like i'm playing well in the tournament i'm on my game today and i want to keep going that's the main consideration um so it's really how do you feel what is how confident how do you feel emotionally how confident do you feel about your ability with that stack and are you able to let go of being eliminated before or are you going to carry that with you and you know trust yourself in the moment also know that there's no rush to re-enter if you get knocked out you can take half an hour before you re-enter you can take an hour before you answer you don't need to do it right away and if you step away you know walk down the rio hallway go outside and just take a minute to breathe and check in maybe uh if you go to the main entrance then down the stairs there's some benches you can sit on then you can really assess whether it makes sense to hop back in or not whereas when you're in there you're in the room you're in the crowd you're in the hype it's easy to just get pulled in um so i would separate myself from the event and then um decide but ultimately you're going to make that decision for yourself you'll know what's best for you i can just give you the factors to consider and the questions to ask yourself um angela so depending on how long you're staying enter the next day versus the same day yeah i mean it really comes down to down to feel you gotta ask yourself like do i want to play more poker today am i excited to play more poker today am i ready for another eight hours or am i feeling kind of tired you know just do a check-in uh sally knows yeah the first wsop experience can be overwhelming but yeah just enjoy and play your best game i really like to come in with a mind of gratitude and think about how blessed i am to even have the opportunity to play in the tournaments and that really puts me in a positive state that leads to making good decisions and also leads to me not being too concerned with the outcome because if i get eliminated i'm already in a positive state of gratitude and i'm grateful for what i get to do afterwards and if i build up a stack in the tournament even better i'm grateful for the opportunity to keep playing poker um when you have alternatives that you can look forward to when you're not playing it makes it much easier to play your best game because tournaments you know to play them well involves taking in an element of high risk and being at peace with potentially getting knocked out so if you have good things to look forward to it's easy to stick with it but i know when i wasn't you know too happy with myself when i was feeling depressed or going through you know pitfalls of addiction and stuff i would try to stay in the tournament for as long as possible because when i got eliminated i had to go back to you know the rest of my life which i wasn't too happy with at the time in retrospect and it led to just not playing optimally let's not play well because i wasn't playing to win i was playing to not lose and play to win you know if you're going for the dream you're looking to win a million dollars you got to play to win you can't play and not lose you're probably not going there to ming cash clifton says i was surprised by you telling someone to wait to re-enter i look at it like this if you want to get a big hand the best way to do is to not miss any hands in a nine hour online tournament i have p-jar and i don't miss a hand yeah i know that approach um that was the approach i took in my younger years is the fear that like i don't want to miss a hand there might be something good i have a i have a nice story uh one year i have no idea which year it was because i've gone to the world series so many times i was playing some 1500 tournament and you know we were on break uh and i knew the clock was ticking down like oh man i got to make sure i get back and i ran back to the table ran back to the table was perfect just enough just in time to look down see ace king perfect now here's the thing about the situation is because i rushed back and i was in that mindset of gotta get it gotta be on top of it can't miss anything everything matters super intense i had a lot of adrenaline running through my system maybe some cortisol as well the stress hormones that lead to impulsive instinctual decision-making as opposed to you know rational well-thought-out decision-making and so even though i got back there in time to get dealt that big hand i wasn't in the right state of mind to play my best i was disconnected from my higher processing um i think there was a raise from another position i think i jammed because i had you know 20 blinds or something and uh opener had aces and i'm like well i'm really glad i rushed back in time for this hand because i didn't want to miss it but just as you can you know think oh well i want to make sure i'm there in case i get a good hand i get a cooler you could also be there to get cooler as well so yes there's going to be some edges well but in terms of like getting a big hand just as likely to get a cooler going the other direction and the thing is if you're in an amped up state of mind you are less likely to play your best whereas when you're a calm state of mind you're going to play your best you're going to make the most of it if it's cooler you're going to lose the minimum if it's cooler against you whatever you're going to make better decisions in general and so the main thing about saying wait to reenter is wait to ensure you're in a calm state of mind if you're you know zen master always calm no matter what unaffected by every hand that happens by all means re-enter right away you're in the right state of mind but it's if you are rattled or emotionally affected from losing the previous hand or getting eliminated from the tournament give yourself time to process that and release it before coming back to the tournament because if that feeling anger regret whatever it is doubt is still in your system when you go back to the poker table you ca you can bet your last chip it's going to affect your future decision making and emotional decision making is not optimal decision making at poker so that's that's why i made the the invitation to take time to wait before re-entering um it's it's all about when are you going to be in your best state of mind and where's your biggest edge you know if you play really well deep stacked makes sense to want to play more hands if you're someone who plays who can play really well but can only play well for six hours actually you're a perfect candidate to late reg take some time to relax hit the gym and then come back um yeah that's the invitation about it and it's it's not going to work for everyone but it's something that i know works for me i've seen what happens when i'm in the rushy needy um scarcity kind of mindset there's limited amounts of stuff versus when i'm in that calm collected grateful abundance mentality that as long as i'm at my best and i show up good things will happen if it means i miss an hour the value that i'll gain for the extra five hours of play because i got back to a good state of mind in that hours worth the hour that i gave up as opposed to you know six hours of b game is not worth five hours of a game might not even be worth three hours of a game um so that's kind of the the reasoning behind that clifton but your system your approach probably totally works for you right and if it ain't broke don't fix it it's that classic old saying um so but i i know that mindset because there was also a time when i was playing uh the sunday major on full tilt way way back in the day maybe 80 people left in tournament and i did not have a p-jar with me i went to the bathroom when i came back i had missed one hand and it was aces and i would have got it all in against two opponents who had kings and queens and i would have held so it can go both ways and uh back in that time i was not happy about missing that hand uh i was very upset about missing that hand i didn't think about well it could have just as easily been me with the queens or with the kings i just thought i can't believe i missed that that was my one chance i think it was the brawl back in the day so i i understand the uh don't want to miss the hand mindset clifton i totally i totally get it um any other questions that anyone has before we wrap happy to answer um and again if you want more talk on world series of poker planning the trip how to stay in the best uh state of mind and all that follow me on twitter gripspoker and i'll be posting a announcement about that whenever i lock in a date my unscheduled self okay looks like we don't have any more questions so i am going to end the webinar um thank you again to everyone who tuned in and for the replay aaron it will be uploaded to jonathan little's youtube

[Document(page_content="all right we're good to go today's topic is going to be on the difference between polar and linear 3-betting ranges we'll be focusing mostly on these in tournaments but the concepts that we'll be talking about you can apply to cash games as well and I think they're easily easily you can transfer these concepts over to cash games to know when you should be using polar ranges versus 3-betting this topic kind of came from a person on Twitter what is the difference between polar and linear 3-betting ranges when should I use either of them and how should i ven defend versus polar and linear ranges we're gonna explore everything to do with these two topics what's the difference between the two and what does a polar range look like and what does a linear range look like when you should use each of them stock depth adjustments so how you should change from linear in polar ranges when you're stacked ups change and also what to do when facing polar in linear ranges and then we have some examples we'll kind of have a little quiz at the end where I have I think it's four examples and you guys will kind of guess whether you should be using a polar range or a linear range kind of a note caveat here at the bottom all the ranges presented are just kind of basic ranges same as the previous webinars that I presented you should address these ranges either tighter or looser depending on the tendencies and the skill level of your opponents also all these ranges assume a 2.5 X open you need to be making the proper adjustments when you're facing a 3 X open or a 2 X open or if you get one of those crazy people that open to like 5 X or 4x so make your judgment adjustments accordingly and as always to these ranges are don't try to memorize the ranges like oh should I three about King 7 suited or an or and not King 8 suited it's more realized that type of hands you should 3bet and the type of hands your flat call and like what type of hands fit into like value three buddy ranges what type of hands are good for bluffing three bets so just kind of I like to think of it as buckets so think about what type of buckets that you should put each hand in or myself when I'm playing live I kind of in my head have gotten a good at visualizing the hand grid and I know kind of which areas of the grid I want to do like draw my three bet Bluffs from et cetera but we'll be looking into all that so getting started we'll jump right in what is a linear three betting range so in this example we're gonna look at what a 10% linear three betting ranges it's simply well I put 10% and 15% this range we looked at is a 10% range so a 10% linear three betting range simply takes the top 10% of hands and three bets them all other hands are either folded or flat called so people out might ask well what are you bluffing with if you're a three betting with a linear range your Bluffs are simply the bottom portion of your range and the word Bluff in terms of a 3bet preflop is not really the correct term because all your bluffs have equity for example you three bet with pocket nines or Jack ten suited here the red hands are unity your three betting and a 10% linear three betting range the green hands are going to be called all the white hands are folded so in this ten percent range your Bluffs are simply like Jack ten suited queen ten suited pocket nines H ace jack-off they're really good hands and they have a lot of equity against the calling range and they're your kind of three about it at all four value and we'll get into when you would want to use a linear three betting range more so for this first topic here we want to look at what types of hands we're three betting here versus when we go to the polar three betting range you'll see how the range is different so here you know nines are better were three betting all our suited Broadway's ace jack-off or better so they're all pretty good hands and then we're just flat calling these ace ten off King Jack you know suited aces there are other pretty good hands that we're gonna play versus arranged so linear ranges one of the problems with a linear three betting range is that your flat arrange becomes extremely weak and opens yourself up to squeezes so if you notice here when we have a good hand we three bet and when we don't have a good three good hand we flat call so that creates a problem in terms of balance because now we know when we don't three bet we have these weaker hands in green and when we three bet we have these stronger hands of red not necessarily a bad thing but it is something that you need to keep in mind that linear ranges create weaker flat calling ranges so if you see someone you know that always uses a linear three betting range they just three about the top percentages of hands and then they flat call now you know kind of they have the weaker portions of the range when they just flat call versus if versus a more balanced range you can't attack that as much so you're kind of opened up two more squeezes behind you obviously here all strong hands are 3bet preflop important part here linear ranges are best used its deep stack depth so when I say deep I'm talking maybe not even 100 big blinds sure 100 big blinds there's gonna be a lot of spots where you want to use a linear range but even more so at like 150 200 big blinds the key thing is here when you use a linear 3betting range you want to be deep enough that you don't really care if you get four bet because you have strong hands you can just call so you want the stacks to be deep enough to call for bets especially if you're in position so for example ace Queen suited if someone four bets you and they're kind of using a balance for about range and they have some four bit Bluffs and it's not just aces kings and queens if they for bet you you're happy to call for bet with ace Queen suited in position when you're say 200 big blinds deep maybe the for bet would be to like say 20 you know somewhere between 20 and 25 big blinds you call so there's 50 big blinds in the pot if you were 200 big blinds deep you still have 175 big blinds behind so you have a stack the pot ratio of around 3 to 4 so still some post-flop play so you want to be using these linear ranges at deep stacks so like I talked about before cash games these work really well early stages of tournaments works really well they're very bad at shallow stack depths so the reason they a linear range is really bad at a shallow stacked up is because let's say you're playing 50 big blinds deep and you three bet King Jack suited here to say 10 or 11 big blinds over and open and now your opponent goes all-in for 50 big blinds you have to fold King Jack suited now preflop which really sucks because you've taken a hand that has a lot of equity and plays well post flop and I wouldn't say turn it into a bluff I don't like that term especially preflop because King Jack suit has a lot of equity but you're unable to call the for bet Jam and so that's why if you're say 200 big blinds deep and someone for bet you and especially if it was a small for bet you could peel with King Jack suited if you wanted to in position but at the 50 big blinds you know when you're gonna get jammed on all-in that's when it becomes really hard to use a linear three betting range because these pocket 9s pocket tons Jack ten suited Queen ten suited these hands you don't want to be folding to four bets all-in so that's kind of the pros and cons of linear ranges let's look at polar ranges and we'll kind of see the contrast to that in polar ranges the strongest hands and weakest hands are three bet when I say the weakest hands and I'll say this a bunch of times today I just don't mean you four bet or three bet four deuce off which is the weakest hand you get dealt I mean you three about the weakest hands that you would play in a range so this hand grid over here the red is our three bet value range which would be Jack's plus ace king ace Queen suited King Queen suited and then the green is our flat calls the blue is our three bet Bluffs so our three Bluffs are ace deuce 385 student eight seven 7 six 6 five suited and a stun off so this is in contrast to the linear range where we don't three about these fringe e'er hands and we'd rather three about these suited Broadway hands we've now moved our three bet Bluffs to balance our value range to the break-even hands that we're kind of indifferent between folding and three betting and so all these the the key thing is the blue hands are still profitable three bets now the reason I brought it up before if you three about four deuce off which you sometimes see people do when they're three betting a so-called polar range they three about four deuce off they are losing money three betting four deuce off it will never almost never be profitable to three bet four deuce off so but three betting eight seven thirty-seven succeeded they're still good hands and they are still profitable we are never gonna 3-bit a hand that is not profitable so matthews had a good question our ace to student through ace five suited weaker than a six through eight nine suited they were actually stronger hands to them then they're actually stronger than the a six through eight nine student but we like to three about them because they have more equity and we have more playability post flop and so we'd rather three about the ace deuce through ace five suited because they just have a little bit more equity in the a six eighty six the race 92 just aren't quite strong enough and we want that little extra playability with those wheel suited aces so one of the key differences with a polar range is that you're gonna have a stronger flatting range so now compared to the linear range we had a lot of weak hands in our fighting range in this polar range we have a lot of strong hands that were flat calling so ace Jack suited ace queen off King Jack suited Queens actually did all these suited broad ways pocket tens nines eights we have a lot of we have very strong flatting range that's pretty happy to call 311 so we're a lot more protected versus a squeeze so keep that in mind just for yourself and also when you see someone using a puller range tree vet that they're gonna have a lot stronger of flatting range and one of the one of the key things also for like exploiting people is that and this kind of one of the main parts of this webinar is a lot of people will only use a polar range or they'll only use a linear range and they don't know how to switch between the two when they should use the two ranges and so a lot of times if you see someone using a polar range there's always gonna use a polar range versus if they use a linear range there's always gonna lose use a linear range and so you can kind of exploit that and kind of know what type of hands people are gonna be flat calling mm-hmm with a polar range it's best used on shallow stacks or from the big blind so you want to use the polar ranges on the shallow stacks because if you three about a hand like King seven suited or a stun off suit and then they for bet shove you're perfectly fine that you're like okay it doesn't suck that much laughs to fold that hand preflop versus in the previous ample if you three bet eight Jack suited and then someone shoves and now you have to fold you're gonna be more unhappy having two full days Jack suited versus the ace ten off and then from the big blind you want to be very polar in your three bets because you want to protect your flattering range against a lot of opponents especially against good aggressive opponents you because you're getting such a good pricing you're gonna be flat calling a ton of hands so you're gonna I just have some stronger flat calls in your range and like I said before never three bet an unprofitable hand don't three about seven deuce suited and say that you were polar let's look at Gerry ass it looks like you have way more combinations of bluff hands than Val your hands is that on purpose well let's count it up here six 12 18 24 plus 16 combos of Ace King it's 40 and then so 44 value combos and we have 4 8 12 16 20 32 we have 48 Bluff combos so we're actually spot-on 48 value 48 Bluff that's actually probably a few more Bluff combos than I want you probably want to be more like if you have 48 value I'd say like 36 but I don't think there's any really hard fast rule so the thing to notice here is that one reason I don't three about a lot of offsuit combos in a polar range is because it's very easy to get unbalanced if you three bet these offsuit combos so a really good like quick tip is if you see someone three betting hands like King Jack offsuit and ace ten off ace nine off and they show up with all these offsuit combos they're almost for sure three about bluffing way too much and you can just start for betting on my tongue and just three betting the suited combos helps you keep your bluff in check because there's only four combos of every suited one and so it makes it a lot easier to control your your Bluff to value ratio when you only three about suited combos so that's why I only three bet the suited ones and keep an eye out for people that three bet all these awesome combos like if you start seeing the three about King ten off or a steno for a Sadoff suit like they're just gonna be three bet bluffing way too much and you just start for betting them so quick note there and then a lot of these other questions I will get to at the end we have our questions segment but you can keep typing them in so now that we've looked at both polar and linear ranges reasons to use a linear range so number one deep stack poker 100 plus big blinds deep you are deep enough to call a four bet and you're not as worried about having to fold equity preflop another key point reasons to use a linear range is positions where you don't flat call often so small blind versus button raises with a strong player on the big blind when you're in the small blind you're gonna want to be using a linear range because when you flat call the big blind is in beginning a very very good price now and now the pots gonna be going three ways a lot of the time and by three betting the small blind against a wide button range using a linear range you get the pot heads up you're gonna win the pot more preflop and it's just you're gonna create more equity playing the pot heads up then you do 3-way especially if it's a strong player in the big blind if there's a weak player in the big blind then I would flat call more the other key point where you want to use the positions where you'd want a linear range at law is like middle position there's just very few hands that are profitable flat calls if you're safe facing like if the low Jack opens and you're in the high jack or say under the gun to opens and you're in middle position it's there's very few profitable hands to flat call especially if there's aggressive players behind and so you can kind of use a tighter linear range and not flat call very often in those positions you often find that a linear 3betting range and kind of limiting the hands that you flat call is going to be much better versus one we'll see in the next slide later position like on the button you want to use a more polar range because you can flat call a lot more profitable same thing it's a big blind it's just much more profitable to flat call because you're closing the action so in those positions it's much better to use a polar range the other important reason to use a linear range is to isolate a very weak player so it gets a weak player always 3bet linear don't worry about three betting polar against weak or poor players number one they call too much so you don't want to be three betting you don't need a three bet as many Bluffs and you get three bit wider for value which is exactly what a linear range is and number two you want to isolate the pot heads up you're just gonna have way more equity and a heads up pot than a multi-way pot so against weaker players you definitely want to use a linear three betting range reason is to use a polar range short-stacked so sub 50 big blind poker you don't want to fold a strong hand preflop if you're a shoved on you know the contrary to the linear range positions where you want to flat call a lot so big blind versus an early position range or on the button versus a raise from any position you're going to be flat calling on the button a lot a lot of people think you should three bet the highest percentage of hands on the button which is not true I think you should your the button will probably be your lowest three percentage of most of almost any position because you can profitably flat calls you know you're going to be in position for example to cut off you want a three bit more than the button because you want to get the you want to knock that button out of the pot when you're in the cutoff or when you're in the small blind even though you're out of position you want a three bit more because you want to knock the big blind out of the pot another area to use a polar ranges against aggressive for betting players so in the previous example the weak player is just going to call and they're not gonna for bet very often versus aggressive players who for bet often you want to use a more polar range because you don't want to have to fold out equity like when you're short stacked 3bet sizing so a linear range is always going to have a smaller sizing than a polar range you're going to be you want to be able to call a for vet and your range sets up better where your three betting when you're three betting a linear range you just want to have a smaller sizing a for calling a four bet and B you're gonna be three betting more value hands so just kind of like when you're betting the flop if it's a flop they were going to bet more often you should bet smaller if it's a flop that you're not gonna bet often then you should bet larger so the polar ranging the linear range is in position like three and a half times the original open the polar range is gonna be four times the original open and out of position the linear range is gonna be four times the open versus the polar range is gonna be four and a half to five times the open and these obviously vary on stack size the smaller the stack the smaller the three bet can be so if you're playing off of say 30 big blinds you don't need a three bet to 5x on the polar range maybe you should be bet to four X versus on the larger stocks you can even go a little bit larger in terms of squeezing if there's some flat calls in the middle when you're squeezing you don't need a size up as much because that range is already weaker so we looked at with the linear range we know a linear range has a weaker flat calling range so if you're playing really deep suck and you have someone the flat called you know they already probably ever we can so my three and a half a can is a position open maybe I squeeze now to four X instead of three and a half add like a half a big blind versus a polar range maybe I add a hole make it five X because they have a stronger flattened range you can kind of use your judgment there these are all kind of guidelines and the sizing is as important as picking the right type of hands and the right frequencies facing a linear 3-betting range so when you're facing linear ranging linear ranges for bedding becomes a tractive in your hand playability matters when your for Betty so say you're facing a 10% linear 3 bet you might for bet like the top 4 to 5% of hands and the reason for betting becomes more attractive especially if you're deep stacked against a linear range is that the person is going to be able to continue with a lot of their three letting range because their strong hands and especially if they're in position they're gonna flat call out and so you can get a lot of value from the top of your range as a note from before squeezing more verse flatters whom use a linear range so attack weaker flouting ranges when you know someone uses a linear range and then they flat call you know they don't have that top ten fifteen percent of hands because they just chose to flat call instead of three bets so you can squeeze a lot more and isolate yourself into a heads up pot with the extra dead money in for betting also becomes attractive against linear ranges because you gonna force your opponents to fold high equity hands so if someone is three betting a linear range and they're three Betty hands like pocket nines and pocket tens you can or say Jack ten suited Queen ten suited you can for bet and put them in a really tough spot with those hands and if you don't make them fold preflop it's easy to make them fold on a lot of high variety of flops and so for betting becomes very attractive against these linear ranges and yeah just kind of what I've been talking about the three better could continue wide versa for better so you can gain a lot of value with the top of your range facing polar ranges it's the exact opposite you should for bet much less against polar ranges and if you do choose to for but hand play ability does not matter really at all what matters is having a blockers to the five bet shoving and having blockers basically to the value portion so if we look here at the polar range it's Jack's queens Kings aces ace king king queen suited one of the most important cards that have you know good hands too for that would be well Ace King would be one of the best hands because you block aces you bought Kings you bought ace king you block a screen you bought king queen suited hands like you know King Queen off suit becomes a good hand to floor bet because you block all the Ace King combos pocket kings pocket queens you want to have hands that cards in your hand that block this value portion of the range and you don't want to have cards that block the weaker parts of their range the the bluffing and the reason you want to be your hand playability doesn't matter like I might for bet a hand like a seven off suit B and the reason I can for bat a seven off suit against a very polar range is one I block hands like aces aces Ace King and ace Queen but to this range is almost never gonna flat call if I for bet he's gonna jam with Jack's plus all these red hands he's gonna go all in with and then he's gonna fold all the blue hands and so he we almost never see a flop when we're facing a polar range and we for bet so pan playability really doesn't matter at all versus if I'm playing a linear range I never won a three bit or four but a seven off suit because he can flat call with a wide variety in hands a key point here is slow playing big hands like pocket aces and pocket kings becomes much more attractive when you're facing a polar range especially often in position with 50 big blinds or less having no four bet range can be correct so in tournaments it's becomes really profitable against aggressive three betters who use polar ranges to just flat call with aces and kings and the reason is is that an especially aces ace is more so than kings but look at these Bluffs that someone might be choosing like ace 5-seater through ace deuce suited like King 7 suited ace 10 off suited connectors those hands have horrific equity against pocket aces and you want to just flat call and let them flop a pair rather than they're just gonna fold those hands preflop if you for bet so like a popular hand you might see one c1 someone 3 bet with is like King Jack offsuit with 50 big blinds which we talked about in our three betting stock size video and you don't want a four bet when they have King Jack offsuit you wanted this flat call and let the flop come king high or Jack high because then they're gonna stack off with their top pair when you have aces or when you have pocket kings so slope Lane becomes really important against polar ranges and you'll see a lot of weak players just get scared and they just start shoving they start just shoving all-in with like their aces and kings and queens when in fact it become profitable more profitable to flat call rather than shove because you want to keep all their Bluffs in the pot especially so often in position this is with shorter stacks when people aren't going to be flattering for bet and they're just gonna be playing a shove or fold strategy so that is kind of a basic rundown of the topics now we're kind of a fun part of this PowerPoint is we have some examples we have four examples look you can look it as a quiz basically I have four situations set up and I want you to take a second and think about whether you should be using a polar range or a linear range in these examples there's no hole cards or nothing so just we're just basing this off of position and stack size and I don't know if there's I don't think any of the examples I gave notes like this is a bad player or a good player so we're basing these decisions off of stack size and position and so I want you to think about whether you should use a polar or linear range and I'll give you guys you know 10 to 15 seconds and then I'll give you kind of a rundown of what range you should be using so first example here we are on the button with a hundred big blinds on the button facing a cut-off three X open you can consider this kind of early stages of the tournament so in this example should we be using a polar range or a 3betting range on the button versus a cut-off three X with a hundred big blinds so we got a couple people saying linear three linear one polar some more linear and polar so this one kind of has a combination of both I would be using a lot of polar 3-betting in this spot you can make a case for linear especially if this is a weak cutoff player linear becomes a little more attractive but being on the button we're gonna be flat calling a lot of hands and so being on the button here I'd rather flat call with a ton of hands because the button we're probably gonna have the most polar three-bedroom range of any position and so since we're gonna be flat calling a lot I want to protect ourself against the blinds squeezing a couple of things that would make me change my mind or one let's say the small blind is a very very aggressive squeezer so this is really important here if the small blind is a very aggressive squeezer then you for sure want to use a polar 3betting range because you want to protect and have a stronger flattened range that you can flat call his squeeze with if the small blind and big blind don't squeeze very often they're kind of tight players and they just call or fold then you can make a case for a linear 3-betting range as well because you're not gonna get squeezed very often so in this spot you can make a case for either a linear or a polar range but just kind of the spot that being on the button versus a cut-off I'm probably gonna use a polar range and just use my position against the cutoff and flat call a lot here this example here we are in the low jack we have a hundred big blinds in the low jack under the gun plus one opens we to a 3x we're playing a hundred big blinds deep in this position here should we be using a polar range or a linear the range so a couple pullers see a few linear ranges so it's kind of 50/50 here on polar versus linear so here in the low Jack I'm not going to be doing a lot of flat calling here one we flat call in the low Jack here we're just letting a bunch of people with a cop we're probably gonna play a five-way pot you know four-way pot there's five other ranges behind us it can squeeze so here in the low Jack we're a middle position we're just gonna have a tight linear range here and we're really not going to be doing a ton of flat calling I think people flat call here too often with hands like deuces through fives and like weeks you to connect your hands so in these positions we're just gonna have a linear range when you want a three-bed a hand like pocket tens pocket jacks because they hit those hands play way better heads up and they play way better in a they play a lot better at a shorter stack to pot ratio so by 3-betting we reduced the stack to pot ratio and we also get the pot heads up and also in general population does it for bet it as much so a lot of people are really scared 2/3 about a hand like pocket tens in this position or pocket jacks or say ace Queen suited because they're scared if oh this early position raiser for bets me then I'm gonna be put in a tough spot but in general people just do not for bet enough they flat call and so I would rather three bet a linear range here knock out all these five players behind me play a heads up pot with a strong hand in position with a stacked apart ratio that you know say we three about to a thousand here there's gonna be 2k in the pot we have 9k back so now it's a four and a half to one stack the pot ratio this hands gonna be much easier for us to play versus if we have pocket tens and we flat call go for five ways to the pot it's just really hard for us to win the pot unless we flop a set so yes and what Bob just said linear because we have a lot of people left to act we just wanna we knock people out and play this pot heads up and having a linear range now it's give me a tighter linear range because we're facing a early position open so we might even go tighter we're probably gonna go tighter than their linear range I presented earlier let's say this person is opening you know somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of hands maybe we just three about the top seven percent of hands like maybe half of them maybe even a little less than that three about the top five percent of hands but flat coloring here is not as attractive as an option with as many people behind us next example we have 40 big blinds the we are in the big blind with 40 big blinds the cutoff has open to two-and-a-half big blinds do we want to be linear or polar in this position you see for Polar's five folders alright good everyone gets this right this is the easiest one probably this is polar and I don't think we don't want to make a case here for a linear range so this is gonna be pretty much your definition of a polar range here we're gonna be flat calling a lot there's a you know what big blind Annie here so we're getting a good price we're gonna want to call a lot and we're gonna be putting our opponent into kind of a shove or fold mode if we three bet because these short stacks so we're gonna be very polar and you know hand play ability doesn't matter that much because we're so shallow so hands like a seven off suit or even like King ton off two hands just block their jamming range or the type of hands that we want to three bet and last example we're in the small blind the button has open to 300 chips the big blind is here for a hundred let's assume the big blind is a regular that you know plays a lot of tournaments so do you want to be polar or linear here in this position see a couple of Polar's a fuel in ears so here you definitely want to be linear with your three-bedroom range you don't want a three-bet polar we want to knock this big blind out of the pot and we want to play a heads up pot against a wide button range with a shallow stack the pot ratio so we always want to be three betting linear from the small line versus late position opens and here we can have a wider linear range because the button could be opening like if I'm on the button here I'm probably opening close to 50% of hands like 45% of hands so as a small blind you could probably three bet the top 20% of hands and be fine so that means three betting hands like ace 10 off suit ace Jack offsuit all your suited Broadway's all your suited connectors like even hands like pocket sevens and better so you can three bet quite wide and quite aggressively here from the small blind versus this 300 button open did anyone else lose sound I had one person say they lost the sound can people hear me all right Kenneth I think that's you everyone else seems to have good audio so I believe that was the last example yeah so in summary linear ranges are great for deep stack poker early in tournaments polar ranges are great for shallow stock poker deep in tournaments you want to use linear ranges more in early position polar ranges more in late position we're going to be flat calling a lot more knowing how your opponent will act react will help you know what type of range to use so this is important against players that never four-bet unless they have like aces or kings you can three that a lot more linear because you are you just three bet linear because you they don't for bet often enough versus players that for a bit often you want to start using more polar ranges making sure you're not having to fold out a lot of equity linear ranges are gonna use a smaller sizing than polar ranges we talked about and then in early position linear ranges often help to get the pot heads up and so we can three about more in early position and it forces the late position players really like the other thing too is in early position like say we three about in that one example right here like we force the five opponents behind us to kind of play their hands head face up so it's a flat call we can kind of put them on you know kind of a weaker range that wants to see a flop hands like king queen suited pocket tens pocket nines and it becomes very easy to play against or when they for bet most players don't for but aggressively enough so we're pretty confident they have those top three to four percent of hands like ace king and pocket queens are better and it's also very easy for us to play against that range and so it becomes very easy to play much easier to play our range versus when we flat call we don't know when they squeeze like where they are in their ranges I think people will have to play more face-up in general when we take this linear spot rather than polar spot so um yeah so this obviously

great content right now and highly recommend signing up for poker coaching and now maybe for you guys his favorite part of the webinar let's jump in some let's jump into questions I'm gonna scroll my back my questions back from the beginning of the webinar and I'll kind of work through them we've been at it for 40 minutes so we have about 20 minutes for questions so start rifling through them if you don't hear me talking it's because I'm reading the questions in between so that takes a second and then figuring out the best way to phrase it so brenno asks and stack size adjustments webinar thought that big stack it was best for hands like 8 7 suited and having a big stock would equate to having a lot of big blinds and when you're deeper in terms of big blinds that's when hands like 8 7 suited go up way in value you are correct in that but just you having a big stack doesn't mean 8 7 suit is a better hand it's more about the effective stacks and effective stacks mean taking into account what what stock sizes your opponents have so if you have 100 big blinds and everyone else says 30 big blinds then 8 7 Souter goes down a lot in value we talked about the value and the bluff I think they're pretty close I don't know exactly the hard math on that I would say in a polar range if you have there there's a mathematical way to solve it and I would assume if you you don't need to have as many bluff combos as value if you have something like a two to one ratio I think you're doing just fine if you're somewhere around you know say 48 value and then you have around the 25 to 30 Bluff combos I think you're gonna be doing just fine again don't worry about the exact hands that I put in the ranges more about the types of hands and I think that two to one valued a bluff ratio on a polar range will be doing you just fine in the small stakes tournaments so Louis has a very good question I've heard that ace nine studio to a six suited is better to three bet as you can flop more top pairs rather than small suited aces can you explain why you prefer the smaller ones and that linear it depends on stack size so if you're three betting a polar range at like 40 big blinds then a Stein studio through h6 suited flopping those top pairs with the nine and the six would make a lot more sense when you're like three betting at like 40 big blinds ace nine suited in a state suit it can become good hands so three bit bluff with because they have good blockers and they flop good top pairs but when you're deeper at like a hundred big blinds 150 I'd much rather three bit ace deuce through ace five suited than the ace nine through a6 suited because having that additional straight equity is very very helpful when playing deep stack poker so the shallower you are the ace nine through a6 you to become better three bets and the struck the deeper you are the ace deuce through 85 suited become better three beds trent asked what position are these ranges from those aren't for any ranges those those ranges that I presented Trent were just examples of what a linear range was and polar range so it was just meant to know the difference between them so your ranges should be adjusted for every position so in early position you're obviously have a very very tight range linear range but say small volume verse button maybe your linear 3betting range is like 15 to 20 percent Alan asked when three betting and deciding on a linear verse puller range are you using an effective stack size versus the razor or against all remaining players this is a very good question and so it kind of depends say you are the opener has 100 blinds you have a hundred big blinds then everyone else has 20 big blinds you have to be careful with a linear range there because you three bets a King Jack suited now one of these 20 big blind stacks goes all-in behind you they have a very strong range and you're put in a really tough spot where you probably have to call it off with King Jack suited against the short stacks so you need to be careful when there's a lot of short stacks behind you because if they pick up a hand then you have to call it off but you can remember also though like once you three but like these 20 big blinds stacks they're probably only gonna stick it in with the top five to seven percent of hands and so it's not gonna happen that often and if you do have a hand like say Jack ten suited you still have decent equity against hands an ace king an ace Queen sometimes they'll have pocket nines you have two overs so you want to have like reasonable hands when there's you know stacks behind you but even in a polar reign like your Bluffs are still going to be strong enough where one of the short stack streams behind you it's not the biggest disaster in the world to have to call it off with 87 suited or King seven suited so Laura asks do I use a mixed strategy rather than a pure polar strategy so Laura's question is asking if I use a mixed strategy where I might three about a hand 50% of the time and call it 50% of the time first is a pure strategy where I only three bet this hand or I only call this hand and here's my thing on pure versus mixed strategies when a strategy is mixed so let's say you're using a solver like piyo solver and it's saying that you should three bit ace jack-off see 50% of the time and you should flat call a strike off 50% of the time it's using a mixed strategy it's mixing up so it's ace Jack it's trying to balance it's flattering range and it's 3-betting range so when a strategy is mixed it means the value of three buddy an ace jack and the value of calling three Jace Jack or the exact same so the only time that pyro solver or any of the solvers that you look at uses a mixed strategy is when the values are the same if it's way more profitable to like for example you'll never see a mixed strategy almost with aces because it's either gonna be way more profitable to three bet them versus basically whenever your deep stack or in some of those situations that I said it gets polar you know if you get three bet and you have 30 big blinds you know it will just say pure flat call with aces because you block their value range and you should flat call so what I'm getting out here is mixed strategies if your planning is a perfect opponent yes you might want to have a mixed strategy but what a mixology is is basically the inputs you get in so the tendency of your opponent matters much more so if your opponent flat calls too much or your opponent folds too much or your opponent plays poorly preflop or your opponent doesn't for bet enough like these are all gonna make one of those two 3betting or flooding way more profitable than the other so when using a mix if something let's say you're looking at a solver and it says using a mixed strategy basically that means take your opponents tendencies into account and only use that one that exploits that Tennessee the most hopefully I explain that the best that's kind of a key thing with a lot of these solvers that people look at nowadays those size guidelines I gave were for three bets with no callers so like I said if they're like linear three betting ranges they're people using an A flat call you don't really need to up your sizes a ton you should up them some but remember they're gonna have week ranges but when people have stronger ranges you want a three about a little bit larger so you can add you know half a big blind to one big blind per flat collar jerry ass if you played with the same player and don't want the bet sizing to be exploitable which sizing would you go with for both linear and polar ranges these ranges are set up where your balance in both ways and I don't think you need to worry about you can use the smaller sizing and have a linear range and you have a larger sizing and have a polar range and it doesn't matter if your opponent knows that you have a polar range or have a linear range it's gonna be tough for them to exploit just because you have strong and weak hands in both range can ask what percentage of hands should we be three betting it's kind of a complicated question but in general you know three about a lot more from like I guess later position opens that have you can have a wider value range it's early position opens you're gonna have a very tight value range and so I recommend looking up some basic preflop charts to start with you can find a lot of them on the internet but in terms of from three betting I think your overall three betting range out of nine had a tournament I would guess is somewhere around eight to ten percent should be probably more closer to the eight percent but in early position that might be three or four percent and then like the small blind it might be like eighteen percent so it seemed very a lot by position so Ken says his I missed the add-on other question his poker tracker for database has him at five point seven percent overall three betting range is that good or bad what percentage of my looking I would say that's a little tight I'd probably try to get it up into the seven to eight percent at a minimum if I saw that five point seven I would kind of assume it's too tight of a range and I'd just be over folding to three bets would be my adjustment if I saw an 8% that's kind of where I would say okay anything over that if I saw like ten or eleven present I would assume they're very aggressive three better so it's more profitable David asks is it more profitable to call a raise from the button that it is three better in position where you're facing you're forcing your opponent to play a larger pot with a weaker range out of position yes and no so let's look at a hand like King Queen offsuit versus the cut off open I'm gonna be doing a lot of flat calling with King Queen off on the button versus a cut off because the cut off is opening a ton of suited Kings like King 5:13 6 suited King 7 suited King Jack offsuit King 10 off suit probably should be opening King 9 offsuit so basically we dominate a ton of hands we King Queen off but those hands are now folding to 3 bets so only 3 bit King Queen off our opponent folds a lot of hands that we dominate so we're playing against a wider range you want to always be thinking when you're 3 betting like you want to be three betting hands that like can get called by dominated hands but also fold out better hand so there's just a lot more hands that are way more profitable to call them three bet because you can dominate a lot more of the cut offs wide opening range by flat calling then by three betting you kind of when you three bet the button I guess I caught off you kind of let him off the hook and he folds a lot of his weaker opens me one second appreciate all the comments there's people like in the comp the content Louis when if a player doesn't fold too many three bets when deep what three betting strategy should we use always a linear strategy if the person calls too many three bets use a linear strategy that's why I against weaker players normally one of their mistakes is they don't fold the three bets so we just want to use a linear three betting strategy and three betting hands like King Jack suited they still call with hands like Jackie suited Jack cutoff suit etc all these hands that we still dominate they just play very weak against those linear ranges interesting Jonathan normally recommends a two to one bluff to value ratio preflop are we doing the opposite as an exploit in lower stakes in general in my opinions people don't fold a ton and so especially I guess when we're using a polar range the reason to use a lot more bluff combos than value combos would be that in general you should be flat calling a lot more than for betting against a polar range and when they flat call some of your Bluffs are now gonna turn into value hands on the flop so for example you three that H five suited and they call and now the flop comes ace high that's no longer a bluff so you need to have more hands in there so you still have Bluffs on the a side board in general people don't fold and they call way too much so I'm not as interested to having as many bluff combos and rather have more value combos so they're against good players you're gonna want to have more Bluffs because a lot of your Bluffs are gonna turn into value hands on the flop and then you need those other Bluffs that you had to to exploit them I hope that makes sense Ryan asked about having a short bankroll and going to try to make polka much day job any word of advice have a lot of money saved up on the side you don't want to be drawing your expenses from your poker especially when you have a short bankroll vini asks he was at my table in a hand were and under the gun player open and under the gun plus one three but and I for that jammed for thirty to thirty five big blinds he asked do I have any for bet bluffs in that jam range no it's gonna be pretty much just a linear range and just a really tight linear range like probably Jack's plus an ace king I don't I would have to have a read that under the gun plus one is three betting with too much to be going really wide there but it's just gonna be a linear jamming range someone else will I have a webinar on post-flop game and it's a good question because I haven't covered any post flop stuff and the reason I have not is because preflop you need to have really really solid preflop fundamentals before you get into post flop play and a lot of post flop problems that people have can be solved by like mistakes preflop so if you can fix people's this hour I do my coaching is I always focus on preflop first and then go into post flop because you solve a lot of mistakes when you have solid preflop fundamentals it sets you a better front of the flop and then you take it further when you have really good flop fundamentals like see betting fundamentals that step set you up better for the turn and so kind of when people are like on the river like oh I got to the river and I don't have any Bluffs or I feel like I'm having to call to wired with weak hands on the river it's because previous streets like the turn and the flop that you're miss playing that are sitting you've got poorly later on two more minutes I'll pick up last couple of good questions that I see Eric so do you recommend three betting a higher percentage on the big blind I don't see a lot of three that's on the big blind these days yes go watch my webinar from a week and a half ago on big blind defense and I talked about that is one of the biggest exploits right now is three betting more from the big blind because people don't see it very often and they react very poorly for those of you that asked to see some of the ranges later on this will be posted on YouTube and you can take about a look back all right we're ready in an hour thank you very much everyone I appreciate it if you want to relook at

the best poker players in the world is going to be well worth it whenever you are a poker coaching premium member you get access to everything on the site and there is a ton on the site this is not a training course at six hours long we have goodness i don't know thousands of hours of content on the site also we just launched a brand new course it is called let's play sundays with alex fitzgerald where he reviews hands from a recent deep run that he made on a sunday including lots of quizzes to test your hand reading skills he discusses heads up display skills adjusting to whatever your opponents do wrong being aware of the tournament dynamic right like say someone just got caught bluffing maybe they're gonna be a little bit more inclined to bluff in the future and this course is not for sale you can only get it as a poker coaching premium member so if you're poker coaching premium member you already have access to it if you're not sign up for the father's day sale at pokercoaching.com father's day to get a big discount we also have another brand new course by alex on how to beat the micro stakes you all told me you want more alex fitzgerald content here it is i'm bringing it to you he has coached more poker players than probably anyone in the world you think that would be me but no alex fitzgerald has actually personally coached tons of poker players and in this course he's going to teach you how to win micro stakes tournaments without having to get in there and like grind all the time he's going to show you how to have a big win rate in these games and again this is not for sale it's only part of poker coaching premium here's one of my students poker coaching member blas scar maker xerxau absolute crusher he satellited in to this five thousand dollar buying tournament on party poker where i got my start a long time ago and heated up winning 1.3 million dollars nice run nice run sometimes whenever you get lucky you think uh you know maybe this was just well luck right everybody can get lucky every once in a while so blas finished his degree in university he set up himself for life in terms of investing most of the money decided to devote a small amount of it to a poker bankroll went out to vegas we studied a lot to get him ready for the world series of poker he did okay nothing great but then shortly after it he took fourth place in a wpt for 552 000 again so he is in there doing it he's also won a big turnout on winamax for a huge amount of money as you can see 2.4 million dollars in lifetime earnings definitely the most successful student i've had recently here at pokercoaching.com and remember i mentioned those world series poker sessions if you are a poker coaching premium member you get access to those where we essentially do have a back and forth conversation where he would send me hands and questions i would make a video replying we were on different sides of the world so our times did not line up but this is actually a very good method of learning where you send your coach all of your questions the coach in turn records a video answering all those questions you get it you watch it you have follow-up questions right or you uh want to share additional hand histories etc right so we did this for 13 hours and shortly after it he won 552 000 bucks good job good work so let's hear from laws let's hear what he has to say hi i would like to take this moment and say thank you to jonathan little who as you may or may not know contacted me in december after my deep run in the possible convenience event and offered me coaching in exchange for me sending him hands uh which will review and make a product album and as we're nearing the end of this process i would like to share some thoughts well the first thing that really struck me out of the blue was jonathan's classification of hands into premium made hands marginal made hands straws and junk he also pointed this quite nicely in mastering small stakes none of them to hold them and it made me realize i was turning way too many marginal made hands into bluffs plaza likes to block the bluffing with jaws and then sticking in pots with too many drunk hands too many junkies part of my range range and this idea of thinking in ranges and mixing it with exploitative play which he really points out quite nicely in his reviews and really made my decision making a lot better than it was and it also made me uh easier to spot uh mistakes in my game on my own and when you are spotting mistakes on your own uh it's a lot easier to strive to work to improve those mistakes rather than when you're just ignorant that you're even making mistakes the whole process did make me want make me want to work hard on my game every day and this is really the one thing i would like to thank jonathan the most is he really made me fell in love with the game so much more than i was ever before and i'm really looking forward to um but this knowledge to use and try to do my best in the wsop and all other tournaments i'm going to play and well do my best it's all you can do is show up and do your best and blas has done exactly that continuing to crush the game he mentioned a skill that he learned from me essentially he was over playing some strong but non-premium hand so he would go for just like a little bit too thin of value or he would decide to you know turn middle pair into a bluff randomly and that usually does not work out too well because you're trying to get people to fold top pair right people don't fold the top here and when you're going for thin value all the time especially as the pot gets bigger and bigger when you get called you're very often beat but as bloss discussed he learned how to classify the hands between premium made hands draws marginal made hands and junk as i discussed thoroughly in my tournament master class and that has allowed him to continue playing the high stakes games and crush here is my tournament master class it is gigantic to say the least it is about 30 hours long where i teach you how to play every stage of a poker tournament optimally and how to maximize your equity again this is not for sale it is only available for poker coaching premium members if you already premium member you have access to it it's right there in the courses tab if you're not a member check out pokercoaching.com father's day here is the table of contents it's gigantic each one of these topics here is about 10 to 30 minutes long and after every single one of these there are quiz questions to be sure that you're actively learning along the way i want to make sure that you're not just sitting there hanging out having a beer on the couch falling asleep i want you to be in there and learning if you actually want to get good at anything well you have to study and i've done my best to make sure that you are in there engaged and studying how to play all of these common spots that you are certain to encounter at the poker table we also discuss these topics um icm it's only three letters but this is a gigantic part of the course this is how we discuss how to play the final table and when their payout applications right we also discuss tournament format adjustments like satellites or entry tournaments six-handed tournaments etc we discuss finances to be sure you don't go broke because a lot of people think you need way less money than you actually do need to play tournaments because tournaments have a ton of variance we also discuss various other topics like mindset tells etc and then on top of the 30 hours of sort of like lecture content with quizzes directly after i go through a bunch of hand histories this is something like 15 or 20 hours of content here that is not included in that 30 where i go through various deep runs i made over the last year since cove it happened and i was stuck at home i was playing online so i fired up the recorder every once in a while and well fortunately we made some deep runs including um winning a 600 tournament third in a thousand dollar tournament second in a thousand dollar tournament right so we were in there battling it out and well we ran hot all right let's see what else we have we also have in poker coaching premium the cash game master class poker coaching is not just for tournament players we have a lot of cash game content as well including my 29 lesson master class where i teach you how to crush the cash games up to 5 10 no limit hold them again this is just part of poker coaching premium we also have over 1200 interactive quizzes where essentially i put you in my shoes and ask you what you would do in this spot and then you have to tell me you click a button you commit to an answer and then you get immediate feedback as to whether or not your answer was good okay or terrible and if you consistently make good plays according to me and the other poker coaching coaches you are going to be a winning player obviously there's again a lot of variance but if you make profitable decisions and you play a lot you put in a lot of volume you will win in the long run because volume cures variance at the end of the day and if you make good decisions you will win if you make bad decisions well you're going to lose here's what blas thought about these interactive quizzes the hand quizzes well i actually made a goal to well go through all hand quizzes a lot to the pokeperson.com i'm halfway through them and they really did it did improve my game really significantly it turns out whenever you have a coach sitting right there with you at the poker table giving you immediate real-time feedback that's going to go a long way to helping you improve your skills it's essentially like private coaching here is um chris j o'neill on twitter another poker coaching student he's been a student for quite a while at poker coaching and he lives in pennsylvania at least that's where he's playing now poker stars opened up in pennsylvania and we talked about it a little bit like yeah i'm just going to go and grind the local games i don't really want to move overseas and he was a good poker player i actually met him at a breakfast something i do for all of my poker coaching members whenever i go to play live poker i'll usually try to schedule breakfast where i'll buy anybody breakfast who wants to come out then we'll go play the poker tournament um we were at borgata when i met chris and he was there he's like yeah i'm gonna go play the thousand dollar six-handed tournament today it's kind of big for me i've never played a thousand dollar tournament but seemed like a good competent poker player we went we played i busted he i believe won the whole thing since then he has been grinding it out as you see he's played about 1200 games on poker stars new jersey these are all relatively small field tournaments that have between you know 30 and 300 people and well he won the thousand dollar buy-in six max scoop high roller and uh well you can see he's up about a hundred thousand dollars just grinding it out to be fair it's really nothing fancy he's showing up playing in games where he has a solid edge he's playing a lot again volume cures variance and uh this is about the most beautiful tournament graph you're ever gonna see good job good work to be fair back whenever i first started playing poker i was playing sit and go's which are nine-handed tournaments and there if you were a good player your graph would look well very much like this as well and i was fortunate enough to have a beautiful graph just like this and it is still possible today a lot of people think that oh poker's difficult or the sights are rigged and to be fair poker is tough the sights are not rigged but if you do show up play with an edge put in a lot of volume it's very difficult to not win so far to make all of the content at poker coaching premium i have spent over 400 000 it's a lot of money i do it for all of you because i know that you need want and deserve the highest level of poker training imaginable so we spent a bunch of money hiring a lot of the best players in the world people who i respect people who i would hire if i wanted to learn poker not just whenever i was a new poker player but today i went out and hired some of the players that i want to learn from so we have content for players of all skill levels including the number one online poker player in the world as of march 12 2021 i think he's since dropped to number two or three they jump up and down every once in a while anyway we have bert stevens draftganger absolute crusher he streams regularly for the poker coaching premium members where you can get online and ask him in real time why are you making these plays in these high stakes tournaments he guarantees a final table every stream kind of as a joke but i think he's final table something every single time so far and he's an absolute crusher we also have james romero james romero is one of the top 10 live tournament players before covet happened since then again the ranking's been all over the place because there hasn't been nearly as much live poker but he makes incredibly great high level content we have frauds jacob he was a wpt player of the year you actually win that trophy if you are wpt player of the year i was too somehow that's lucky um we have jonathan jaffe world-class exploitative player who has studied gto as well and i like jonathan jaffe a lot he gets in there and battles harder than anyone i i thought for odds jacques battled hard but jonathan jaffe really doesn't we have matt affleck as you see lots of coaches i can go on and on about this all the coaches are great we have matt affleck who every week he does a webinar where he asks the students what do you want to learn and then he goes home does the homework next week comes prepared with a nice presentation where he discusses whatever the students want to learn like just recently he was discussing how to play in multi-way pots with a medium stack and a lot of people screw that up a lot of people never lead when they're first to act when they call in small blind but matt discuss that and show when you should and when you should not sometimes you should sometimes you should not and it's good to know that because that's going to go a long way to helping you improve your skills right and you the student gets to essentially tell them what to teach you and then he does who else do we have we have tommy angelo the mindset expert alex cheryl we talked about him earlier we have brad wilson world-class cash game players making a lot of high-level cash game content for us we have tristan wade who has been teaching poker players to succeed for a very long time michael acevedo he wrote the book modern poker theory i actually am part of d poker and it's my job to curate the content and the other publishers said we need to get a gto book so i said i know your guy michael acevedo we had him write the book it was amazing and well now he's a poker coaching coach he also does joint webinars with bert stevens on a regular basis where they go through bert's wins for uh millions of dollars we also have lexi gavin who plays lots of cash games and tournaments as well evan jarvis grips and ryan o'donnell you may not know him but he is one of the biggest winners in the high stakes spin and goes he recently released a giant course on spending goes similar to my tournament master class where he explains everything you need to know to crush that very unique form of poker i learned a ton in the process of just reviewing the content and uh well he's world class of playing that exact odd three-handed winner take all short stacked structure and he can teach you how to do it too on top of that 400 000 i've already paid like i said i am routinely hiring these coaches to create more and more content every single month lots of interactive hand quizzes live webinars live courses live classes right whatever you need to get good at poker i'm doing my best to ensure that you constantly have that and you are upgrading your skills on a daily basis so let me ask you a question obviously i'm not gonna charge you that five figures ten thousand dollars per month for access to the site even though i pay that and i'm not even gonna charge you 500 per month but if i did charge you 500 per month which is the price of some of the other poker trading sites out there on the market if all i did was help you plug one additional leak or win one additional big pot each session that you would not have otherwise won what would that be worth i mean think about it right if you're playing even fifty dollar buying tournaments or a hundred dollar buying tournaments if you win one additional pot late in the tournament that's quite valuable if you're playing one to no limit you want an extra 200 so you do that once per week that's 800 in profit in your pocket right what if all i did was let you attend the live weekly coaching webinars with our coaches who have a combined live tournament earnings of over 56 million dollars and i let you ask them your biggest poker questions every single week what would that be worth to have access to the best poker players in the world and what if all i do is give you a way to put yourself in thousands of poker situations every single day and get instant immediate feedback from my hand-selected team of world-class coaches so you have a way of practicing daily even if you can't go play live perhaps because of cobin i realize we're getting out of that so that is great or maybe you're just in america and you don't want to play on an illegal gambling site and you want to get in there and practice and improve your skills with new situations and feedback available for you every single week what is that worth well if you think that's worth 500 well now's the perfect time to join because

[Document(page_content="hello everyone i'm jonathan little i'm a professional poker player with over seven million dollars in live tournament earnings and a bunch online as well and for the last few months i've been working on a new secret project it is my newest book secrets of professional tournament poker the essential guide this is actually a complete rewrite remake etc of my first tournament series that i wrote 10 years ago put into one gigantic book as you can see lots and lots of range charts hand examples everything you need to know to succeed at tournament poker and today i'm going to walk you through it as you can see here is the title page secrets of professional tournament poker the essential guide it is a big hardcover book about 450 pages i've seen some of my students books uh they got a long time ago and they've read very very often and those books are worn out so i did my best to make this a big sturdy hardcover book of course you can get the ebook version as well it is published by d b poker they published the absolute best poker books on the market let's go through the table of contents real quick then i'll show you a few pages of the book so first things first how do tournaments work it's important to understand the game structure that you are playing tournaments are not cash games and should be approached differently right we explained why they are so profitable and also just like the general fundamentals right it's very important to understand the basics you have to learn to walk before you can run right so we discuss how you should not really get stuck on formulas a lot of people think that they're gonna have to do all sorts of math at the poker table but that's just not true you do need to do some work away from the table but this book outlines everything you need to know in order to succeed we also discuss the uh you know the basics really like thinking in terms of hand ranges counting combinations so you know what ranges are comprised of we discuss expected value pot odds implied odds reverse implied odds and a bunch of other stuff all right next we go through and explain how to play at various stack depths we're going to discuss deep stacked play medium stacks play and shallow stacked play now you see here we have deep stacked play listed as 50 big wines in the previous version of this book that i wrote 10 years ago deep stacked was actually 75 big blinds or more but in basically all poker tournaments now you do not play all that deep stacked in the beginning back in the day you would start with 200 big blinds and the tournaments would take forever now they are substantially faster paced for whatever reason and therefore i would recommend that most of you spend most of your time studying the shallow and medium stacked portions of the game that said uh you do need to know how to play at least somewhat deep stacked as well because you will be playing deep stacked in the beginning of poker tournaments so we discuss how to play pre-flop it's important to understand that every single range chart that you are not going to need well every single range target that you are going to need could not fit in this book it's 450 pages already but i have links to all of the charts that you could possibly need to be sure that you have a reference guide so that you can learn how to play essentially every spot before the flop from a fundamentally sound manner and then in the book i explained how to adjust to take advantage of whatever your opponents do incorrectly we also discuss various post-flop concepts like the four types of hands if you're not already doing this you generally want to be thinking about your hands in terms of whether or not it is a premium made hand that you're happy getting a lot of money in things like sets and straights and whatnot right then um marginal made hands these are gonna be hands that are pretty good but don't wanna get all the money in that's gonna be stuff like top pair bad kicker middle pair good kicker etc draws and then in the draws you need to be thinking of it as a very very good draw you're happy getting money in a medium strength draw that you are eh happy with but not happy enough to get all in with and then a really junky draw that is like a bad gut shot straight draw that maybe you use it as a bluff right so you want to be classifying the draws like that and then you're also going to have junk and in this very very big section we explain how to think about your range and go about balancing your range from a fundamentally sound manner so that you can to some extent replicate what a game theory optimal it came to game day level what a game theory optimal solver would do because at the end of the day if you play closer to a fundamentally sound strategy than your opponents even if you don't know what they do wrong you're going to win in the long run now again of course you always want to make sure you are exploiting your opponents a lot of this book is about taking the fundamentally sound manner strategy and then adjusting to whatever your opponent is doing correctly so make sure you are actively doing that we discuss playing the flop deep stacked playing the turn deep stacked playing the river deep stacked and then there are you know various other topics that are relevant like fancy place syndrome for example this is something that keeps a lot of you know pretty good poker players stuck in the small and medium stakes games and definitely because they think they're supposed to be in there trying to outplay everyone every single batting round and i hate to break it to you very often you don't even know what your opponent's doing you may have ideas you may be guessing but you don't know and when you don't know that's going to result in you essentially leveling yourself into making poor plays that are very far away from the fundamentally sound strategy and that's going to be really bad for you all right then we go through medium stacked play we break this down 35 to 50 and 27 to 35 those stacks do play a little bit differently and they actually do play substantially differently than when you're playing let's say 100 blinds deep so we go through and we discuss things like um the all-in squeeze play stealing from early position which is something you really cannot get away with whenever you are playing very deep stacked because you're just gonna get maximally punished when you happen to run into a good hand because you're gonna be out of position and whenever you're playing deep stacked out of position you better come with a good hand but as you get shallower that's not quite as true especially if your opponents play poorly then we discuss short stacked play below 27 big blinds we break that down 15 to 27 5 to 15 and then fewer than five a lot of people think that you should only go all in or fold when you have something like 15 big blinds but that is a gigantic mistake that's been i guess a spread by people who have push fold charts if you only use two options though push or fold you're taking a lot of your other substantially more profitable options like min raise off the table now by shoving or folding of course you make your decisions really easy in exchange for losing a lot of money and that's really bad i want to make sure that you are using a relatively simple strategy you can actually implement at the table but one that is also very profitable right and we discuss that it is okay to raise and then fold when you have 15 big blinds or even 12 big blinds again lots and lots of charge for you to reference will be available if you buy this book you can go and download them so you have everything you could possibly need available for you then we discuss playing the late stages of the tournament essentially adjusting to payout implications right early in the tournament the idea of survival is not all that important because you're a long way from getting in the money but as you get deeper and deeper into the tournament like on the bubble or once you're in the money right the final table payout applications become very very important i'll actually show you a chart or two from that section today we discuss short-handed play right as you get shallow uh short deeper and deeper in the tournament inevitably you're going to have to play short-handed and you want to make sure you are adjusting properly and taking advantage of your opponents who do not adjust properly then we have a bunch of hand examples going through how to play the fundamentally sound strategy not just with your hand but with your entire range on every betting round it's a big in-depth section um very similar to the homework i have at my training site pokercoaching.com where i ask you what you would do on every single decision point with your entire range that you get to that point with and that's how you need to be thinking about poker a lot of people think they're supposed to be thinking in terms of oh i had pocket jacks and i raised and it came a seven three what do i do but that's not a great question because sometimes you have ace king sometimes you have ace ten sometimes you have eight seven suited right don't think about your exact hand you have to think in terms of hand ranges all right next we discuss various other considerations including continuing to learn right you wanna make sure that you are always improving your skills if you think that you're going to read one poker book out there even a very good one like this one and never have to study again you're probably fooling yourself because you want to make sure you're consistently striving to improve at a faster rate than your opponents are you got to realize poker is a competitive game where you're playing for substantial money and typically when you're playing for substantial money most of your opponents are going to care at least some and if you care none or the absolute minimum you're going to get left behind and i want to make sure you're continuing to study and improve your skills long term we also discuss the mental and physical approach to poker we talk about things like luck tilt intuition etc right these are all things that are a little bit nebulous but are very very relevant to poker we have a big section here on tells physical tells online tells um to be fair i don't think tells are all that relevant in the very high stakes games because most people in the high stakes games have really good poker faces but in the small and medium stakes games tells are quite valuable and the thing is a lot of people get it in their heads i'm gonna find a tell every single hand against every single person i play but i don't think it really works like that you'll find tells sometimes maybe i don't know 10 of the hands that you play and then they may not even be all that relevant of tells but when you do find a consistent reliable tell you can adjust your strategy quite substantially and that's going to result in you winning substantially more money from those players right so don't think you're going to uh you know magically reading your opponent's souls every single hand hate to break it to you it's not how poker works you need to play a fundamentally sound strategy and then adjust according to whatever they're doing correctly and if they have a physical tell that essentially removes a large portion of their range from their range because let's say you know they're strong that means they don't have any bluffs that will allow you to make big folds right and you will just never hero call them in those scenarios then we discuss some practical tips for tournament play like protect your cards i know that sounds super simple but you don't want to let your opponent see your hands and you don't want to let the dealer take your cards unnecessarily common sense i know but it happens and there are a lot of other various things like this like checking in the dark betting weird best sizes like does it matter if you bet 800 or 775 will that make your opponent play differently maybe it will maybe a diff maybe it won't we discussed chopping the prize pool when you should when you shouldn't we discuss how you should generally play very quickly assuming you have an edge because if you have an edge you want to play as many hands as possible right because every single hand you're dealt in you make money as you can see this is a big book very very uh it covers everything right this is the essential guide to tournament poker then we discuss how to go pro which you know may not be your goal but for a lot of poker players they strive to become the best player they can be and if they could quit their job especially if they don't particularly like their job or maybe they're young and they don't have a whole lot going on going pro is a very very reasonable option because you can pretty easily make something like 100 per hour from poker if you devote a lot of effort to getting very very good at it and you know maybe 100 is a lot of money too maybe it isn't and you know that's that's going to be very important to your decision right anyway we discuss all of this also things like bankroll management the downswings that you will inevitably experience we discuss the rake how to minimize it right because if the casino breaks away all your profits it doesn't really happen or it doesn't really result in you winning money right we discuss not loaning money out to people whenever you loan money out to people sometimes they screw you and that's not good either all right let's take a look at a few charts from this book just to show you what we have going on let's take a look at this right here all right so here we are going to be discussing playing from the big blind okay and then as you can see we have some text explaining the scenarios and then explaining why you should play a pretty wide range this is big blind against under the gun playing deep stacked if we're shallow or stacked or facing a minimum raise or if there's a big ante in play you should play even wider but something a lot of people do wrong right off the bat is they do not three bet as a bluff with some of these you know pretty good hands instead they just only threw about the absolute best hand so when they threw that from the big blind against the under the gun razor the under the gun razor knows that you must have a very strong hand and that's going to result in them playing very very passively against you right if instead you have some weaker hands in your range it makes their decision much more difficult also notice hands like a6 offset ace four offsuit etc are just folding to a three big blind raise playing deep stacked against the under the gun player because their range is gonna be a lot of good strong high cards including all the best aces one thing you'll also notice every single suited hand is played a lot of people play the a6 off suit every time but they don't play the seven two suited and that's an error and if you make consistent errors before the flop on a regular basis well the money is not going to flow in your direction let's take a look at something else here now we are going to be discussing when there is a re-raise before the flop so well let's get right to it let's go over here so in this scenario someone raises and we re-raise okay when we re-raise in this particular scenario the actual spot does not matter this is going to be our range again we don't want to go too in depth here because the video's already getting long in this spot when the board comes ace nine three you want to be categorizing your hands into premium made hands draws marginal made hands and junk as we discussed at the top of the show and then you want to bet with your premium made hands and your draws and depending on how your range lines up with your opponent's range which is explained thoroughly in this book uh maybe you want to be betting with your marginal made hands and junk in this instance we decide we do not um notice that ace is as slow played as a marginal made hand to protect the rest of our range so you see here we have like ace king pretty good pretty good on ace nine three ace nine pretty good ace three pretty good these are our premium hands our draws are going to be pretty weak draws on ace nine three with no flush draw right but you see all of these are gonna be like back door flush draw over card to the nine right stuff like that back door straight draw so they kind of count in general whenever you are betting with what is essentially a polarized range your best hands and your draws as we are in this scenario at most at absolute most you can have two draws to one premium made hand here it's about whatever it is one point three to one so this is fine this is going to be a relatively balanced betting strategy and difficult to play against and notice our marginal made hands are either going to be top set which is actually a slow play nuts ace five and ace two which are pretty good kings queens and jacks which are also pretty good these are hands they can very reasonably check and call in this scenario we don't actually have any junk quite often we have junk maybe we could give up with some of these hands that are in pink every once in a while but we don't need to we can just bluff them because our range is so strong and going through and analyzing a range like this is going to go a long way to helping you play appropriately here's how the opponent should react again they want to go through and categorize their range notice that range is different than the three bettors because the three better has all the best hands right plus some bluffs right all the best hands plus some bluffs whereas the caller does not have the best hands anymore because they would have forbid those right so you go through and you again categorize your range and then play accordingly okay and this is what you want to be doing on a very regular basis and going through this book is going to help you know how to do that we also have charts like this that essentially go through and show how to construct various ranges in this scenario we're on the river discussing how to structure your betting ranges based on the size of your bet and here as you see when you're betting small 10 pot your range should be 92 value bets and 8 bluffs based on the odds your opponent is getting depending on your opponent's strategy maybe you want to have fewer bluffs but you should have some bluffs right but a lot of people do when they bet 10 pot is they have only value bets in which case you're really easy to play against right your opponent should just fold unless they can beat some of your value bets we also discuss how to roughly use your premium made hands strong marginal made hands weak marginal made hands and junk in various betting ranges as you see as you bet bigger you get to have more bluffs this is something a lot of people don't fully recognize they think that when you bet bigger you better have a better hand because why would you put money in with garbage well turns out that you um you get to have more bluffs as you get to bet bigger i mean if you love right here take a look at 300 pot right when you bet 300 pot you get to have 43 bluffs especially if you're very polarized as you will be meaning when you bet with a value hand a premium eight hand it's basically the nuts so when you get called you always win with a value hand and when you get called and you're bluffing you always lose in that scenario if that is the case you can bet three times pot with 57 value bad some 43 bluffs and that's gonna make your opponent indifferent which results into you winning whatever is in the pot on average which is quite substantial we won't win the entire pot on average so we go through and explain how to think about your range and use the appropriate bet size here we are in the risk premium section this is uh based on pallet implications we go through and explain how to figure out how much additional equity you should have when there are substantial payout implications usually this is going to be when you're at the final table right so for example say you're at the final table and you have a big stack what is a big stack i know this is kind of a loose definition but let's say you have 50 big blinds the next biggest stack also has 50 big blinds and then everybody else has 20 big blinds or fewer in that scenario say you raise with ace king and the other big stack just goes all in for 50 big blinds okay gets back to you you have to call 48 to try to win 100. so you need to win 48 of the time right but there's gonna be a big risk premium at the final table because you are highly incentivized to outlast all the storage stacks and depending on the exact pail structure that risk premium could be either well pretty big or gigantic and this scenario is probably going to be on the higher end so you're going to need something like instead of 48 equity you're going to need 48 equity plus something like 35 equity so we're looking at at something like 73 equity if you just ran your hand against your opponent's range to justify calling and i hate to break it to you but ace king does not have that say 35 75 70 72 equity something like that um ace king is not gonna have 72 equity it's just not going to happen so you need 35 equity on top of whatever your raw equity would normally be required to justify calling so you have to put in 48 to 100 means you need to win 48 plus 35 it's hard to win that often and that's gonna result in you having to fold a ton because you are highly incentivized to outlast the other players now you may say why wouldn't the big side just go along with anything then and make you fold a ton because when you do actually wake up with a hand that can call like aces and kings and you do call it is just an absolute disaster for that player because they took their stack that was very big and had a lot of equity and just do it in the garbage notice if you're the big stack against the short stack though now the risk premium is basically none so let's say you have 50 big blinds and the short stack has eight let's say you find a scenario where you need to win 30 of the time maybe you need to win like 32 percent of the time to adjust for the risk premium instead which doesn't change things a ton uh and then we go through and explain how medium stacked it changes some and then shorts that can change some as well and if you're not thinking like this when you are deep in the tournament you're gonna end up making errors because you are gonna call in appropriately or fold inappropriately and that's not gonna work out well for you you wanna make sure that you are always playing well and this book ensures you are playing well so make sure you check it out secrets of professional tournament poker the essential guide you can get it right now at d and be poker.com secrets that is d-a-n-d-b-com secrets i hope you enjoy it i've worked very hard on this book it's been 10 years in the making it's important to realize that i've improved my skills a lot over the last 10 years when i first wrote the book i actually knew roughly what to do in a lot of the spots that come up very frequently but i had no clue why and there were some spots that i was just kind of clueless about a good example i used to fold my big blind too often when shallow stacked i would defend like 60 of hands but you're supposed to be defending more like 80 of hands in a lot of scenarios and that's a leak that's a mistake but i have improved my skills and i have learned also in shallow stacked i used to never lead all in whenever i was in the big blind and someone raised but for example say you're playing 12 big blinds deep and the cutoff raises and you call the big blind with a wide range if it comes all low connected cards like let's say 764 you should be leading all in for 2x pot some portion of the time and i never did that back in the day because well i had not studied with gto solvers and i didn't know nobody else was doing it either nobody knew but now we have all worked hard we've improved our skills we have studied and i've taken all of that work that me and my team have done and consolidated it here for a book for you so that you can get great at tournament poker quickly so check it out at dnbpoker.com secrets hope you enjoy it thanks for watching and good

[Document(page_content="hello sharks before we get started today i wanted to make it really clear that this is the second part of a video series where i go through a bunch of hands that i played recently in the high stakes u.s poker open to go back and watch the first part of this video head over to pokercoaching.com uspo right now make sure you do it because um yeah that'll make this video make a whole lot more sense so check that out before you watch this video at pokercoaching.com uspo have fun all right we're back at it second ten thousand dollar no limit holding tournament of the us poker open let's take a look jake daniels loose splashy aggressive player that said my only experience with him before this was from a what was it 25 50 100 no limit holdem cash game on poker after dark where the blinds went up after like two hours to 50 100 200 and he played insane he was in a lot of hands battling splashing he stacked me when i opened it up king jack he three bet from the small blind but 10 3 of spades okay flop comes like king nine three or something king nine two king nine two one spade you know how this goes he bet i called turned with some spade he bet i called whoever was another spade giving him a flush he jammed i called i lost and against players like that you just have to do everything you can to let them make some sort of aggressive play some sort of line that will result in them over bluffing right that said jake played substantially more just like tight aggressive in this tournament i'm not sure why he has such a drastically different style from one game to the other but he certainly did that day so anyway he's playing perhaps a little bit too loose but pretty pretty standard he opens it up under the gun i like to just call let's take a look at our charts real quick just to see if this is anywhere near reasonable or if we should just three bet it every time as we see here jax mixes it up and as you get deeper stacked i know we only have 80 big line charts here but as you get deeper stacked i think you're going to call even more with hands like jax just try to flop a set you really don't want to three bet and get four bet even if he is a little bit on the looser side so we call it's a very good flop for me check 10-2 what do we do what do we do jake now bet small 2500 it's kind of a bummer you always would much prefer your opponent to be betting bigger in this scenario because when he bets small he's actually giving himself a pretty good price with hands like ace king king queen king 9 suited right and you don't really want to let those hands see the turn for free slash cheap so i definitely think that in this scenario raising is the ideal play but is it the ideal play against jake who i know perhaps likes to barrel it off maybe maybe and i don't know i don't know the answer to this one because this is a very exploitative spot i do know gto solver usually likes to just slow play top pair i'm sorry top set because it's kind of hard for your opponents to have anything but in this particular spot it's really easy for them to have aces kings queens ace king king queen right so i could definitely get behind raising in this scenario but if i do think he's opening all sorts of nonsense like a6 of harps and then tripling it off well then calling's a whole lot better right because he's drawing basically dead big blind calls as well which is kind of a bummer because he almost certainly has some equity he turns a king which is not great jake now bet 6k similar spot on the flop except for now i could actually be beat notice i could easily be beat by kings or ace queen or queen 9. however with this when he bet small like this i definitely think he's more weighted towards non-premium hands usually most people in this scenario when they keep betting turn especially if they bet big on the turn it can be very polarized to either sets and better or a draw and there are some draws available like lots of club draws they can bet turn and call arrays so when he goes this size i think he's gonna be a little bit more weighted towards marginal made hands like ace king king queen ace jack maybe hands like two pair jack ten king ten probably not straights though the question is if i raise will he call with a hand like king 9 suited or ace king even he probably shouldn't because if i'm raising here in this scenario i mean what can i really have i have to have a pretty good hand or a pretty good draw right also i really don't want to raise and get jammed on i realize sets are very good but if you think about his range it's going to contain every single ace queen and a whole lot of queen 9 students so this is a spot where i think we just have to call also every once in a while big blind has the nuts so if it goes 6k call 24k i can just call and try to spike on them i call big blindfold so that's good we just probably have the effective nuts here river he bets 18k if there ever was a blank instead of this two let's say it was a three and he bets 18 can we go for the raise probably not because we're just raising into all the ace queens right and a hand like ace king or even king jack if he has it may find a fold which would be really annoying on it three or three blank because notice i could have all the ace queens as well and i could have all the queen nine suiteds i mean maybe i don't play every queen nine suited but probably would when jake opens um so in this scenario if there ever was a blank and he bets big like 18 into 28 i think it's probably just a call even with a set when the rivers are two though it just doesn't matter because i have the nuts um obviously he could have kings obviously could have twos but he could also have random ace two suited he could have straights that will feel kind of inclined to call now and it may even make like a loose call with something like king queen thinking i'm running some ridiculous bluff so we're definitely putting in the raise the question is to how much and again very exploitative spot in my experience people do not especially like calling off for all their money in tournaments especially in the early levels this is a re-entry tournament so you know that that may not necessarily apply but i think he thinks i'm a little bit on the straightforward side maybe because i have taken the strategy against him so far of make a hand don't fold right so for that reason i think i can't just go for all the money i think if i go for all the money he's only going to call off with a straighter better as he should right so he's not really screwing up if i if i go all in whereas i think if i go small like 45k or 50k he may find a hero call with aces ace king king jack king 10. um so i think that's pretty nice i will say if i go 45k and he jams me pretty miserable spot right because we really jam here with a straight i think it'd be pretty insane um anyway i go 55 i think that might be a little bit too big looking back at this because will aces or ace king really call 55k here it's pretty optimistic right notice i block king jack and um you could have king 10 i suppose pi doesn't play every king 10 probably only king 10 suited well unless he's playing loose who knows what he has so this is a spot where i think i should have gone a little bit smaller because i think when i start going big like this we are going to get even a hand like ace king to fold which is i think a lot of his range when he takes this line and i mean yeah we get full value against a straight but i think straight's kind of unlikely anyway he snap called me so i was like oh i didn't know what was happening he snap called me turned over my hand and he showed the king 10 off suit just said he can't have the kington off suit go figure um i think this king tends probably just to fold if jake's watching this he told me he's a member to poker coaching um if he is watching this i would tell you i'm pro like find some bluffs find some logical bluffs i mean seriously there's like none i could have asked at clubs but notice that blocks some of his auto folds right what can i have call the flop would i call the flop with like ace five of clubs i mean i guess for the small bet i would nine eight would i bluff the river with 9 8 when you bet flop into multiple people bet turn and then bent river in a spot where you just have all the nuts in your range i think it'd be pretty insane i mean i i got i can't even find logical bluffs here i'm sure i'm under bluffing and against players who i perceive to be loose and splashy in general then i think they just call a lot so if they're going to call a lot i'm probably under bluffing anyway he called the king 10 pretty quickly and i think this is just a it's just the fold it's an annoying spot they certainly don't like it but i mean there just aren't very many logical bluffs like i'm not playing queen eight right so if i'm not playing random queen eight and i probably won't even bluff the ace x because notice that blocks pocket aces it blocks ace queen as well but it blocks pocket aces blocks ace king these are the autofolds i want them to have what am i really bluffing with nine eight of clubs and eight seven of clubs that's it notice those blocks and flush draws that i like them to have to autofold just to fold i'm not bluffing very often here if the river was a three i think it'd be way more reasonable because then while he does have straights he also has like a lot of two pair that could go for value like this and then he's a little bit more inclined to call i don't think the two changes a lot in terms of my like super relative hand strength but i do have some sets like this that do get stronger anyway i raised it up he said i've called me and we got some chips but where'd they go who knows like i said if it's just like a standard flipping spot i i'm not going to show it because i don't really remember i honestly don't really care there are a lot of spots in poker where it's just like 30 40 big blinds each ace king against queens kings against jacks whatever you're just in so don't be too afraid of playing big pots sometimes you're gonna win and sometimes you're gonna lose all right carrie katz opens carrie katz is i'm not gonna say on the tighter side but he is generally on the more conservative side he's also the type of player who i think again really doesn't like getting stacked um so given that's the case well that's just the read i'm gonna go on playing a probably regular distribution of hands from early position he doesn't get too out of line pre-flop i don't think he may get a little bit loose or splashy every once in a while but i don't think that's gonna be the case under the gun like ever anyway i call pocket twos and i flop a set i check he bets kinda big what do you think we should do here with the twos so i actually ran this one in the solver because i was not sure if i need to just like put in a min raise immediately put in shove immediately or call and let's see is this it this is it as we see here twos and fives and sevens if i have the sets are very clear calls here why are they very clear calls well i really just don't have all that many hands that want to raise notice action on bear man he doesn't want to go all in at all just a few smattering of sevens right i'm sure i got a few random bluffs in here like ace five ace three etcetera but i'm really not doing much um shoving at all we are just a little bit too deep for that so we're doing a lot of min raising or you know two point one x raising you might say are we really min raising here with like a seven and the answer is yeah when we get down to this stack depth we just have to be kind of willing to stack off with hands like well a7 and it doesn't mind a lot of protection right so a7 in this scenario really doesn't care if the opponent folds out queen jack right um i will say also kerry is not really the type to barrel all that often so if anything that's just gonna make me a little bit more inclined to get it in with some of my decent top pairs immediately because he's not going to take a hand like queen jack and keep betting it on a random non queen or jack turn i don't think so this is a spot where i i would probably be pretty willing to just get in with these sevens a lot of the sevens really understanding that yeah whenever he has me beat i lose but that's okay that said sets sevens fives and twos are all just calling you got a slow play here yes there are clubs available but he's gonna have a whole lot of hands that do not contain clubs and are drawing thinner dead so i love calling turns an ace easy check this is the board where he's gonna return that he's gonna be betting a ton i just said he probably wouldn't bet the queen jack but i bet if he had the queen jack here he wouldn't bet it now the question is should we call or should we shove i also wasn't sure about this one because we have super nuts effectively right and if we run it through the solver against gto turns out sets all shove now check shelf turn um notice even some pretty weak hands like uh 3 2 suited for too suited to go for the shove pretty cool to see five four five three like pairs with gut shots go for the shove here uh i'm probably not shoving in this scenario i definitely think carrie was well is in general weighted towards premium made hands here like good aces although i wouldn't be shocked if he's gonna go for the bluff with queen jack right um so the question is is carrie the type of player who will bluff the river if i check call and i would venture to say no like i said i don't think carrie's just bluffing it off all that often um however will he find a big fold if i shove here on the turn with like ace 10. and look i think he's probably going to call with 810 but i wouldn't be shocked if he finds a nitty fold so this is a tough spot um also in live poker we mentioned this in the in the first hand from the first ten thousand dollar tournament where i folded the top pair because you know kind of got a vibe i didn't have anything i don't recall this particular scenario amazingly well but if i got the vibe he didn't have anything what are my options well i have to call right so this is scenario where i realize solver says to shove and i totally get that that the i that the solver says to shove again if you are going to play like gto make sure you find the adequate bluffs with the gut shots and the pairs these all are well mostly flush draws i presume with the random four and the random three all these are flush draws which makes a lot of sense all the flush draws make sense to check shove all the good aces make sense to check shove but these gut shots i do not think are quite so logical at least for me like if you give me 5'4 here i really want to jam and 5 4 into this i wouldn't think so but apparently the answer is yes um anyway i called here river's at eight of clubs this is the big bummer whenever he does happen to have a an ace it's gonna let it go check check on the river which is annoying but i like to go check check and he announced you win carrie's not the type to randomly slow slow roll me knit roll me whatever with like ace jack and say you win in this scenario i have to believe carrie just had stone nothing and if he had stone nothing then maybe we had the live pro read there maybe we didn't this is a tough thing about live poker is that you can justify almost anything with how to read how to read and the tough thing is is that sometimes you will have a read sometimes you will not have a read and if you consistently make plays based on reads and sometimes you're right and sometimes they're wrong it's very difficult to keep track of whether or not your reads are actually good i would definitely venture to say that most of you most players in general should give a little bit less credit to their reads i feel like if anything i kind of downplay my reads to the point that maybe i should even give them more credit me personally because i know i just like don't make so many plays based on them but like right here it's clearly just a shove from a gto point of view but i did not do it did i not why did i not do it i probably well i know i did this because i thought if he did not have an ace he's just going to literally fold every time and i thought he's probably drawing super thin or i thought he had the nuts and was going to shove river anyway but notice on some of these bad rivers like low low clubs for sure he's just gonna let it go check check even with hands like ace king so we want to just shove immediately get full value and this is probably a bit of a mistake by me i should just shove turn that said when he ever whenever he says you have it he probably had liberal airball queen jack and only way to get any value was to check but notice he didn't bluff it he's not going to bluff it even on scary river for my weak top pairs then like clearly why am i why am i checking doesn't make any sense the main value in checking is to give him every opportunity to bluff because he's always going to pay off with the good hands anyway right so i don't really care about the good hands i mainly care about the bad hands is there a way to get money in with the bad hands there i thought he would bluff sometimes and to be fair maybe he does but he didn't that time um one thing also worth noting i know we kind of breeze past this but whenever carry bets 13k on the turn out of my 36 and i call this is a spot where some people will apply an amount of pressure like this with some garbage hand thinking if i call i must not be folding the river and that very well could be true that said i know if i had 5'4 here i probably wouldn't have shoved like the solver side i probably would have found a reluctant call and then folded the river so uh clearly that's not necessarily right but a lot of people will apply pressure like this like a pretty good amount of my stack and then just never bluff forever thinking that if i make it past the turn i must have a hand that's going to call or i'll call most of the time and then they're just never going to bluff a river if that's the case if you see people make this particular size not in relation to the pop but in relation to my stack where they think this is a committing play for me then perhaps we just want to shove in these scenarios because when he has nothing he's not going to bluff it off and when he has a good hand like an ace he's just going to call it off every time all these little nuances you can find looking back at the hand but sometimes these things actually are relevant and if you do play with people often enough as you probably do in your local casino or your local home game you can find spots like that where people will make these particular plays and if you can find spots where you know they're just like either really weak or really strong if you know they're really weak and they're not going to block the river you might as well get it in all right we raised queen 10 suited perfectly fine in standard flap a flush draw seems like a great spot to bet we are pretty deep if i bet and get raised we can easily call we discuss this a lot in the tournament master class that if you bet a draw and have to fold to a raise and your draw has pretty good equity like 25 30 35 you probably screwed up um unless it's some uncommon line like right here if i bet any amount he shoves it all in on me for 176 000 whatever you know you got it but if i make a bet of let's say 4 000 6 000 or something like that and then he raises to 20 i can just easily call and try to spike a club right so this is the spot we're gonna be betting draws like that i bet four he calls and i'm not gonna say it's optimal to go ahead and triple it off here but i already know i have all the nuts or effective nuts in my range right i have ace king ace queen a6 suited ace two suited sixes probably not twos but he doesn't have aces right and he doesn't have ace king most of the time so i have a lot of really good hands here and i have a lot of um bluffs with good equity right so this is the spot where i'm going to be betting the flop really wide probably everything and then i'm actually going to be continuing to bet the turn very often with a pretty wide range we get the ten of diamonds this is one of these spots where i think we don't really need to fear getting raised because if i do bed and get raised i can still call right i mean like i said he's not gonna rip it in if i bet ten thousand or twelve thousand also i can still get called by some worse hands notice that worse clubs will call or king exit clubs if he had diamonds diamonds will call right he could have had diamonds against a small bat if he has a six or two he's gonna call so i think this is a reasonable spot to continue betting even though i have what's very clearly a marginal made hand in this scenario i'm not all that concerned about getting raised by an ace because you have to think he's going to raise most of his best faces on the flop therefore he probably has a weaker race weaker ace has no reason to raise here given i can have like i said all the best aces um so i don't think we can get raised all that often at all there's some spots like this come up where you can extract value from worse made hands and draws and also just build the pot for the times that you do get there on the river there is a little bit of marines making the pop bigger whenever i make a flush i get to put my money in when i bet here if he calls and i miss on the river i don't improve and he checks i'm just going to check behind rivers the jack of spades didn't improve seems like a pretty easy check behind me if i bet here will he ever call it worse than my hand i don't think so will he ever fold a hand better than my hand will he fold like queen jack of diamonds in one hand um i don't think so so just easy check check and we did get full value from the six tough spot on the turn with the six because the king is not necessarily good if he gets there on the river with like king six because i could use like ace king and there's no guarantee i'm gonna pile in a lot of money if he gets there the tough thing is that i could definitely be betting with all the gut shots right well you know the broadway cards i don't really have the low gut shots so it's a nasty scenario for him because like imagine i do have eight seven suited and i bet the flop with everything and i turn a gut shot i'm gonna keep betting like i said we can bet very frequently on the turn here and he's gonna call then the river comes to jack i'm gonna bluff with the h7 and win the pot right if i make an eight or seven on the river i'm gonna check and win the pot so when i miss i win the pot when i get there i win the pot that's not good uh what about queen jack same thing right if i bet turn and he calls and i miss on the river i'm gonna bluff he's going to fold if i hit on the river i'm going to bet he's going to fold well if i hit a king right actually he's going to call the king because then he just loses more if i get a jack or a 10 i'm going to go check check and win so this is a spot where this hand plays like really really poorly on the turn i don't think my opponent necessarily could have done much different here because if i bet small like this he's getting really good odds but his equity realization is going to be very very bad in this scenario with this this type of hand and even when he gets there sometimes he's gonna have big reverse implied odds so pretty rough spot and to be fair fold preflop maybe i'm not gonna say you should definitively fold preflop but i mean let's look at 80 big blind charts let's look at big blind versus hijack raise i mean he's probably supposed to play this hand but i could i could be convinced that it's not like printing money and you see all these hands in this region down here four four three ten seven jack seven queen seven queen six queen five king four king five i know he has king six like all of these hands if you think your opponent is going to play very well post flop and you know that you're not the best out of position post plot player in the world i don't hate folding okay jack 10 off suit raise from the button okay we'll be calling the majority of the time basically every time do we ever three bet this big blind versus raise from button i know that i personally don't but we do see a small portion of three betting here notice these suited connected type hands three bat well junky suited connected type hands three bed every once in a while you definitely want to make sure you're working those in any time you look at the gto solver and you're playing against a good player you need to make sure you're working in at least some not necessarily these particular hands like eight five suited ten percent of the time but you probably wanna take nine seven nine six ten six eight six seven six six five ten seven nine eight ten nine right all of these and just three bet them every time you don't necessarily need to find the five four half the time or the five thirty two percent of the time but you should use these every once in a while also i don't think it's necessary to go with these pretty junky hands instead just do like all ace ten all king jack and you'll be fine so you're gonna three about some good sweetie connected types well marginal pseudo connected type stuff and then just a good strong linear range nice and easy to remember right anyway i call i check he bets this is a scenario where i definitely think raising is viable my hand's a little bit better i'm almost certainly raising something that i've learned from just studying deep stacked in the gto solver that top pair good kicker basically always checks raise check raises like ace 10 king 10 here jack 10 is probably a little bit weak you're gonna find the jack 10 10 9 10 7 do a lot of calling turns to 7 and i opt to lead all right this may be a little bit fancy why is this a little bit fancy because my opponent actually does have some nuts in his range the times you want to lead on the turn are when your opponent does not have all that many nut hands and you have a lot of nut hands and while i do have a lot of nut hands here so does my opponent he would definitely raise pre-flop with all jack 9 right also a lot of 9-6 students probably all 96 suiteds and maybe even some 96 off suit i remember who this was this is i remember it was one of the good good american kids i forget exactly which one it was um good strong gto player so i decided to lead here and typically the plan when you're leading is going to you're going to leave very frequently when you do decide to lead but i don't think this is the card to do it i should have just checked here and check called i think it's also really bad if i lead and get raised with this particular hand for sure but you gotta realize i have the best hand almost every time you may not fully realize that but i do have the best hand almost every time because we block top pair and overpairs are hard to have so there definitely is merit in protecting here because if you think about my opponent's range whatever it is has pretty good equity so if it has pretty good equity i don't really want to check and let that see the showdown for free right like imagine as king queen rather than just fold the problem though is that my opponent may decide to run a bluff on me every once in a while and that would be really bad where he raises i call then i check the river and he just decides to go for it and i fold or i call it's pretty bad either way right so i think this is just completely unnecessary this board was a little bit lower like say everything was two notches lower besides the two so make it eight six five then i would like leading way more with a hand like an eight for top here then because then i have a lot more nuts on my opponent because he's probably not raising all the off suit low straights whereas i would have those this was just not necessary i lead he calls easy check on most rivers in this scenario whenever um i lead any calls and i would want to keep betting on the river with a very polarized range either busted draws or just like really good made hands i would go very big so betting small here is nice that he doesn't do all that much raising because i just get to get protection and value right and then the play is to check the river and then check call with this hand most of the time um we discussed this concept in one of my books a collaborative book excelling at tough no limit holding games and this play goes horribly wrong if your opponent raises adequately from a gto point of view and you're gonna find hands like queens just raises and plays for stacks in this scenario does the opponent do that um i don't know most people don't most people just call and if they're going to do a lot of calling leading's not all that bad because you just get to see the river every time right and like i said there really aren't that many bad rivers the only bad rivers for me are a high diamond a jack and a six everything else is fine right this time we get a high diamond that's also a jack so now the most likely draws the opponent could have the nine which make a lot of sense it could easily have ten nine nine eight nine seven et cetera and the flush both come in he could easily have a flush he doesn't want to raise the turn with a flush draw or anything not not a lot in general because if he raises and i jammed me he's in a pretty bad spot and i could have some nut hands here right so anyway on this river i think i have a pretty easy check and i was going to call a lot of bets but then he pots it annoying spot very annoying spot i definitely wish he did not pot it when he possibly is going to be very polarized so now i have to find bluffs what bluffs make sense to blast it here if you had a jack like queen jack you got to think you would just check it back if i had a 9 here would i check i would have for sure so that's good because i'm somewhat well protected here the tough thing is is that he could easily take a hand like an eight and bluff it like if you gave him eight seven eight ace eight or a seven i bet he would bluff it and i really didn't know much about this good aggressive kid yet if i knew what i knew today would i call it's coming back to me this is the guy chris brewer good luck aggressive well i think pretty gto type player should we call against him like i don't hate it again another spot live reads right you may say can you really make live reads on the kids i don't know i don't try all that hard if they come to me they come to me um it's probably fine to fold here this jack of diamonds even though gives me two pairs of pretty bad card the opponent's not value betting a worse made hand for value i mean he could be bluffing with the ace 8 type stuff like i said but i think this is just a fold it's annoying super annoying notice if i just check the turn and he checks i can easily check call river if i check to turn any bets i can easily call if i check there with any bets i can easily call because then we've induced a lot of bluffs here i know i have a lot of nines and he's still blasting me so just gotta fold annoying spot um and to be fair maybe we actually played it fine just some sometimes you get bad rivers if you go through the tournament master class looking at various you're like your equity on various rivers sometimes it just goes right in the dumpster with that hand i think it just goes right in the dumpster when on that jack of diamonds or especially queen of diamonds or king of diamonds or whatever all right raise call ace four off suit one more big blind to try to win seven sure bottom pair i'm sorry top pair top bottom pair might as well be bottom pair top pair with a gut shot check check check that's great for me turns a four this is against the kid brock parker very good battling player as well this is a spot where i have to presume it's going to check through a ton i have a lot of threes my opponents have basically none so this is a spot where even though i don't have the nuts i do have the best hand a lot and it's very easy for my opponents to have a random ace or a random draw or even a random hand like pocket eights that will check check check turn check check check river never put a dime in the pot unless they make a set so i realize that's not all that big of a concern like how do i knock it out drawn by eights but imagine one has eights and one has nines they both have four outs that only pay me off if they get there right so i think here's the spot where it's pretty free to go for a bet because i have the uh the best hand the majority of time and i have a lot of threes whereas they both have very few i realize brock over here in the low jacket usually have ace three or pocket threes small blind could have it but probably not we can have pocket threes or eight three but that's it so i think it's a pretty nice spot to go for a bet and i don't think we need to bet all that big because i'm really only betting here with like very high equity draws made hands that are almost certainly good like this and a lot of threes i bet brought calls rivers of ten interesting spot um we have some draws of course they would love to go for the bluff on the river the opponent definitely has a lot of ace x right could even have some under pairs that decided to get splashy against the small river bet so i think we need to go for a bet i think we can go pretty small when you're out of position you often can go for small blocking type bets with a range of a lot of marginal made hands some nuts some bluffs i think that's the spot it's pretty clear marshall made hand the alternative play is to go big like 50k if i get the vibe as just like a lot of ace king ace queen etc he could just have a 10 which would be a bummer um i think either play is fine either small or big depending on what you want to do depending on read you have on your opponent the problem with small is that every once in a while he's just going to try to blast us i had not played with brock all that much but he's seems to be winning lots of high stakes tournaments i presume he can get after it i did go for the small bat and i think this is probably ideal and i think i would just not even have a big bet size here because i realize my range needs a lot my small betting range needs a lot of protection meaning i need to have a lot of threes here i think i think small bet with everything's good in this scenario he decided to pony up and blast me up to 80k very weird spot because i know i have the threes right so if i have the threes i'm just very well protected because i have a lot of threes and that's basically none hmm he has basically no threes would this player who i don't really know just good kid would he drastically over bluff here into a range that contains a lot of threes i don't know in a spot where he doesn't have very many threes right would he presume either correctly or incorrectly that my small bet range contains almost no threes if that's the case some people will just decide i don't think you have it i'm raising if i had to guess what happened here i think he probably just had ace three probably just had ace three maybe he sneaks in a few bluffs in this scenario with busted draws but i remember this hand in real time i was like i kind of felt like i was getting outplayed like you just decided you don't got it i'm blasting you but i'm not even sure that's how kids think anymore today old school players sure sure they can sense it and realize they don't have the nuts and they'll just get after it um to be fair maybe that's what brock's doing i don't know but i think this is a spot where we have a pretty reasonable fold i have all i mean look if i'm betting small with all the threes here like i'm pretty sure i would have then you can just fold out non-nut hands here and i don't have all that many bluffs to begin with this is a hand where if i bet and get called i went vast majority of the time if i'm betting it raised it's just a fold and i should i think i think i should almost never get raised here so we fold i don't remember what happened in this tournament because um it's all a blur i know a lot of people in order to bust i mean um a lot of people like really really really hang on to every poker hand they played ever in their whole life i don't really do that so much i try to let it go i will go home study the spots and forget about them and just try to relax and be well prepared to play in the next tournament and i think that's probably for the best i know a lot of people lose sleep over hands or dwell on it like i certainly could have lost sleep on this hand but what good is that going to do me what good is dwelling in this or dwelling on this hand going to do for me and i think the answer is just not a lot right so if it's not going to do me a lot of good to dwell on this take a look at it study it make sure nothing like horribly bad happened and move on after this i lost i don't remember how one quick thing before we wrap up today i'm

[Document(page_content="today i'm extremely excited to bring you a very special video from one of my favorite pokercoaching.com coaches and recent world series of poker bracelet winner justin just gto saliva in this video he covers a topic that i am frequently asked about which is how do i improve quickly and move up in stakes well when i first started working with justin just a few years ago he was grinding 25 nl online 10 cent 25 cent no limit holding cash games but over the course of the last two years he has worked really hard he's dedicated his life to poker and now he's playing the biggest cash games and tournaments in the world he's also going to be discussing various mindset tips that he uses to make sure he stays motivated and actively improving consistently this class was part of last year's 30-day challenge at pokercoaching.com that was geared towards cash games but this year i'm running a brand new challenge focused towards tournaments if you want to use this new year time to improve your poker skills you can get completely free access to the first seven days of this challenge right now at pokercoaching.com challenge go ahead check it out access is very limited to make sure you get in right now hope you enjoy this video and i'll see you in the challenge hey everybody this is just gto for pokercoaching.com coming to you with day 30 in the cash game challenge i just wanted to first say congratulations for making it today 30. i think it's been it's been really awesome to see all the students um a large amount of students getting in there studying every single day improving their cash game skills you know taking the quizzes hopping in the discord asking questions and just being really eager to learn so congratulations on that i hope it i hope you enjoyed it i hope that you learned a lot and i hope that it helps you build really good habits moving forward so for day 30 i wanted to cover how to improve quickly and move up stakes i think that this is something that no matter how good you get at the game whether you're the best player in the world or a beginner it's something that everybody has a big desire for right everybody wants to improve as quickly as possible and have success in whatever they're spending their time on so hopefully i can bring you some value today give you a few tips that i think will help expedite your process in in your career in the game so first i want to talk about short term results in my mind too many players especially inexperienced players they go and study and then they use their short term results as a metric of how good they are and i think it's a really really big error and i want to encourage you to make sure that you understand that if you go and study for 20 hours or you finish the 30 day challenge and you go play a six hour session and it goes really well it is extremely detrimental for you to say wow i became really good at poker um i'm crushing the game now because from that point on you're just gonna stagnate right you're not you're going to be too complacent you're going to not study and work as hard as you should um so i just want to encourage you not to use short term results and it works in both ways you know you can study for 20 hours and then if things go poorly in one six hour session it's not indicative at all about where your skill level is you know it's too small of a sample it's not enough data but but so many people study hard for a week study hard for a month go play a session things don't go well and they say ah this just isn't for me you know studying isn't for me i just need to focus on my game and how i play right and that's a very detrimental mindset to improving quickly so make sure that you stay focused and if you want to be successful in poker you focus on constantly improving no matter if things are going well or going poorly so i wanted to share this quote from james clear that i think is pretty applicable james clear is the author of atomic habits or or building atomic habits something like that which is a really great book he says it is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis and i think that this is just so applicable to the game of poker because many people have the wrong mindset and don't understand where eevee comes from right if you get an aces versus king's pre-flop there's no uv there right because you're going to get it the same amount when you have kings and when you have aces and so you can't let your plus minus in a session fuel your outlook right your ev comes from the uh like the small edges you have and different parts the game tree right like you're gonna play button three best strategy versus the low jack better than your opponents you're going to defend the big blind properly where other players defend it too wide you're gonna open from the load jack the button is going to call the board comes king 3 deuce and you have a better strategy on the flop than your opponent when the seats would be switched that's where evie comes from and so when you kind of devalue your plus minus in a session and you stop worrying about you know if you're up to buy-ins or down to buy-ins or or whatever it is from a financial sense and you only focus on printing your edge and making small improvements on a daily basis you're going to just increase the amount of ev difference that you're able to generate in spots compared to the compared to that of your opponents so with that in mind i want to talk about you know when when you should apply that mindset to your current schedule uh in my mind you know just to [Music] kind of reiterate on the studying reiterate on it like i think it's a bad idea to binge 20 hours go play for a week be like oh crap i haven't studied in a while go study for 10 hours and then go play for another week it's much more important to have a constant desire to improve and spend high value time i put on here every week but really it's like it's every day every time you play you should spend high value time to improve after that session um so where i think this should fit into your schedule is in your post game so i think you should spend a little bit of time reflecting on your current postgame habits in my mind most people i know let their plus minus fuel their emotional state so it's like if they win they're happy if they lose their sad and then either way their post game typically ends up like you know taking a shower and going to bed or grabbing dinner grabbing a beer and going to bed and i think that's it's a pretty big mistake because right when you finish the session that's when things are freshest on your mind and so i would really encourage you to um spend that time like being really useful i think i might even yeah it's more even on this slide like you should have every single post game you should be getting rid of all the wasted thoughts and energy um like whatever you're feeling from the session right if if you're upset about a hand you played you need to kind of reflect like okay why am i upset about that you're just wasting your time and energy caring about things that don't matter when you could reset your mind and kind of focus on like get your mind back on the strategy every single session whether it's a good session or bad session you should spend 10 to 15 minutes focusing on the strategy and how you want to improve how you want to play spots differently the next session so i have that you should run or share marked hands like if you're using solvers um you should just run you know the three hands that were the biggest questions something i really liked from brad wilson's webinar he talked about the entry points right so this for me is like i you know i totally agree with it it's like once you finish a session if you find a couple spots that were tricky or you didn't know what to do you have to review it right you can't just imagine if every single time you have two players one of them every single time a tricky spot comes up where they don't know what to do they just kind of like you know become nonchalant about it don't care don't review it and then move on and compare that with somebody who every single time that happens they run the spot in a solver or they share it with their coach or share it with their friends and improve their strategy on that spot obviously the second person is just going to improve so much faster than the first so one thing i think it's good it's also good to like articulate or write down your strategy have a very clear understanding of the way that you want to play your spots and focus your mindsets your mind set on playing your best and improving between every session once again it's all about converting your natural mindset of being happy or sad from how the session went to being happy or sad on how you played right understanding that i'm upset because i didn't play my best okay well next step i didn't play my best because x y and z right and then improve right away um you know people tilt in different ways the way that i tend to tilt is after a session i end up all of a sudden having a door dash with you know a bunch of junk food and all like 20 minutes later i'm like what the heck am i doing right i'm like i'm upset and so this was a couple years ago and it fueled me to make sure after every single session i do something where i get back on the strategy um you know going over martens or under the hands etc and if you make that a habit i mean you can just imagine the difference it's going to make in your game if you study and you're sharp for 20 minutes after every session um you know what that's going to do for you after a year you know what that's going to do for you after two years it's just really going to add up and you're going to be drastically ahead of ahead of the other people who after their sessions they grab a beer and chill out so i really encourage you to make the most of your time uh the next thing i want to talk about is to take great notes and develop a really strong understanding of your own game uh this is a quote i like from josh watskin um he's kind of like a i don't know what he would be considered now um he was like a world champion chess player and then became like a world champion tai chi or something like that but he writes he wrote the book the art of learning um he's kind of like a guru on how to learn quickly and efficiently he says that i've long believed that if a student of virtually any discipline could avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice both technical and psychological he or she would skyrocket to the top of their field and obviously it's impossible right like we're all going to make the same mistakes twice but one thing that i really like about this and that i think helps can help your poker game is that if you take great notes and you have a really good understanding of your own game you understand where your holes are you know i can't tell like i don't know how many it's been but i've had so many students or friends where i've been like you know what spots have been tricky for you like where do you think you need to study and they just have no idea right and it just means that they don't have a strong understanding of their own game of their own strategy you know for example i've been working on out of position spots because i made a bet sizing error on you know one of those like lojack opens button calls king three deuce or something and i bet small and like small batches don't make any sense and it was like a very clear entry point into my own game where if i was making that mistake it means i don't understand that spot well right and so right away i can now dedicate time to make that a priority and study out of position flop strategy for a significant amount of time so i think that when you take and then in addition to that when you go through and do the study you have to take really really really strong notes um you know fill notebooks with notes get excel sheets get google docs etc the game is so complex that if you don't have good notes you're going to forget what you learned in six months and if you take two weeks off you're going to be behind right so if you take really good notes and things are organized at a really high level you're going to be able to review your own strategy like reference it if you have any questions about it and then use it to understand holes right and leaks in your game hosing your strategy so although it's not like you know fully achievable to avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice um having that as a as like an aim or you know a goal i think is is really good you know it's going to hold yourself to a really high standard and it'll hold yourself accountable in these spots which is only going to like expedite your learning process so one of the last things i want to talk about is his ego really um it's a quote from jonathan that i really liked he said if you want to get very good at something find someone better than you and learn everything you can from them um and it's pretty simple but it's just so true you know i think about my own career and in life and it's like everything i want to achieve in the game somebody else has already achieved it and so getting rid of your ego and just doing your best to learn everything you can from them is just going to be so beneficial yeah i i think that i put your goal is only to improve who cares if you were right and i it's just so true it's like so many people care if they played a hand correctly or they hold their tongue because they don't want to ask a stupid question or be wrong about a spot you know they play a bad hand and they don't even review it because they're like oh it's a bad hand they don't want to revisit the pain that it caused them right and so um you need to get rid of your ego because it just doesn't matter if it doesn't matter if you are right or wrong the only thing that matters as the is that you can improve and so i put you know provide value ask questions you know one thing i love about poor coaching is how accessible all the coaches are you know a lot of a lot of the guys and girls you know doing live webinars interacting in discord um very accessible to questions so i definitely encourage you to keep this in mind you know get rid of your ego don't don't feel the need to be right or sound smart or any of those things just focus on learning from those that have achieved what you want to achieve learning everything you can from those people and and using it to to improve your game as fast as possible all right so we'll talk about moving up stakes the first thing is that your goal is to beat the game not a specific game what i mean by that is i'm sure you know there are many people out there who are playing like 10 and l or live one two and you could focus a lot of time on different population tendencies different crazy exploits to use to maximize your win rate in that specific game but if your goal is to move up stakes i don't think that's the correct way to approach it i think that you should be increasing your foundational knowledge you know your theoretical knowledge such that once you beat 10 and l and you move up you're able to build it you know you're able to like you lay the foundational ground work while you study and you improve and then when you move up stakes all you're doing is is building on top of what you've already learned versus when you try to beat a specific game and you're just focused on these like exploits that aren't going to be applicable uh now let me let me actually say a quick caveat in the fact that these are for people whose goal is to move up this is not you know if your goal is to have the highest win rate in your local 1-2 game and you know that's what you want to do then by all means you know focus on beating that exact game focus on you know after your foundation having these wild exploits and maximum exploiting players leading in weird spots etc um yeah so i i mostly mean that for the people who are trying to move up in stakes i think it's really important to focus on beating the game of poker you know building a foundation that you're going to be able to build on over and over as you move up um just kind of laying the groundwork for for the future of of your strategy so the next thing is to uh get good like really good data and be professional with your finances um when things aren't going well in poker it's really easy to be nonchalant about tracking your finances and tracking your data and i would encourage you that if your goal is to improve quickly and move up stakes that no matter if things are going poorly or going great you need to be very professional about tracking your finances and tracking your stats especially in live poker it's just so easy to not track how many hours you played one day after a bad session and then estimate how much you lost or um you know winning a casino prize like the 500 hot hand or something whatever it's called and just like saying that you ended the day plus 600 right you need to be really professional and track like the better the better data you have the more educated decisions you can make in terms of moving up stakes so i would take it very professionally either track it on an app on your phone have an excel file at home always track your hourly win rate your big blind per hour or per 100 if you're playing online and just be really really sharp with that because the better data you have the more the more comfortable you can be moving up if you know that after three hundred thousand hands you're beating 25 and l at four and a half bb per hundred and you move up to 50 bb well you have a money tree just sitting there right you know that at any point you could move back down play 25 now and grind out a win rate but if you don't have clear data on that it's going to be much harder for you to keep keep your confidence up if things don't go well when you move up it's going to be much more difficult to understand what games you should be playing like an example from my life would be if there is a tough 1020 game or a really good 510 game well you're kind of just guessing which one's better but if you played in 200 hours of each it's not a huge sample but you're gonna have a pretty good idea that the variance involved in the 10 20 game isn't is probably not going to be worth it it's probably just going to be better to have your higher edge of the 510 game um instead of moving up and playing the 10 20 game so i have here to understand and set what your goals are i think that uh like just being realistic about it a lot of the people who are going to be studying this are going to have other sources of income and so if you have other sources of income your risk of ruin can be a little bit higher than somebody who is paying their bills from poker right so understand that if your goal is to maximize your hourly rate like absolutely maximize it you're going to be taking on more likely taking on more variance than somebody else who wants to play a little bit lower stake have a slightly lower hourly but has the ability to not deal with the same swings right so understand what your goals are realize that at this point in my life i'm happy dealing with swings i'm happy dealing with all the variants involved my goal is to maximize my win rate and so i'm going to be playing in you know a little bit higher risk of ruin games than somebody else who has a family and you know can't can't at this point in their life deal with the possibility of risk of ruin being seven percent or something right they need to keep it more like two percent so they should be playing a lower stake or building a larger bankroll before they move up so i think it's important to like constantly be thinking about what your goals are and there's a site called pokerdope.com it will it can show you like the variance involved risk of ruin depending on your win rate et cetera so it's another reason why keeping track of your stats and finances are important you can plug it into these variants calculators and it'll tell you uh you know all the all of the projections for what you're going to see if you let's say you have four bb win rate and you move up and you're like okay i'm estimating i'm gonna have a two 2.5 bb win rate it can show you uh kind of all the swings and data that will come along with that all right then the last thing never let your ego make decisions for you and what i mean by that is that when you move up stakes like when i first played 510 it was probably three or three or four years ago or something and i remember sitting there like kind of being on a high like the first time you played time rake you know it's the first time you're playing with a couple players you thought were pretty good and you want to battle with and all of a sudden you play 10 hours of the game and you're like wow i'm a 510 player and you start like you know getting the you know getting your ego involved and it's just it's just never gonna there's nothing helpful that comes from that it's only going to be hurtful for you um and so i just like really really recommend to never let your ego make decisions if you take your shot and you play 510 and you lose a bunch of buy-ins first off you should be in you should have your good habits where after every session you're reviewing your hands you're finding the leaks in your game and you're constantly improving uh you're able to articulate your strategy and write down the improvements you're making um but more so if you don't have an ego you'll be you'll you'll be able to easily move back to 2-5 with having no like bad feelings about it you know there's way too many people that think to themselves i'm a 510 player now i'm a 10 20 player now and then they go play like they lose some they need to move back down and they feel horrible about it you know they they think that everybody that they know thinks that you know they're not confident enough to play the game or they're not good enough to play the game or you know all these things like running in the back of your mind and so if you get rid of the ego you just realize okay i'm moving down to five because it's a better decision for me right i'm going to print my edge better here build up my bankroll before i take a shot again and while everybody else is worried about being a 510 player being a 2-5 player all these things that don't matter i'm focused on playing the best i can in the game that i should be playing and improving after every single session such that i'm going to end up being the beating the higher stake than what i just moved down from right so like getting rid of your ego in terms of moving up stakes is super important because all of the sudden if you're losing after a shot take and um and you have like too high of a risk of ruin it's just gonna make you play worse right like if you're if your ego is too big that you can't move down stakes you shouldn't move up in the first place um because if things go badly they're gonna go really really badly for you because you're gonna move back down and play worse because you think that you're playing with a bunch of bad players and you know so i just really recommend make sure you get rid of your ego understand that moving up stakes is not about um you know it's not about pride it's not about anything else it's like you just set your goals realize that when you move up stakes it's very likely your win rate goes down variance goes up improving every day is going to help you move up stakes faster all of those things right but none of it's about pride none of it's about your ego none of it's about proving to other people you can play at a certain level or anything like that so yeah that's all i have that's all i have for this presentation i hope that you know there's some information in here that you can use to expedite your you know your process your improvement um and you know once again please let me know if you guys have any questions if i can help in any way i'll be in the discord being be in the comments uh et

[Document(page_content="i've read the comments here on youtube and a lot of people seem to have trouble playing pocket jacks which is crazy to me because pocket jacks are actually one of the most profitable hands in poker assuming you play it well thankfully for all of you pokercoaching.com coach alex fitzgerald heard your cries and decided to make a video series discussing specifically how to play pocket jacks it's a three hour long series at pokercoaching.com but today i'm gonna give you the first half of it here on youtube this is gonna to combine theoretical teaching and active learning so make sure you use the quizzes throughout this video to assess your skills to make sure that you are playing pocket jacks well and if you like this type of content be sure to sign up for my brand new 30 at pokercoaching.com challenge where alex has a similar video explaining how to play another troubling hand for some people ace king and ace queen so to use this new year time well and to get the first seven days of the 30 day challenge for free head over to pokercoaching.com challenge right now enjoy the video and i'll see you in the challenge hey everybody this is alexander fitzgerald or assassinato doing another one of my training video series another one of my training video installments today we are going to be discussing how to play pocket jacks if you've ever seen any of my training videos this is going to be similar to them where i don't believe poker players learn through simply theoretical constructs there will be theoretical things i will discuss with you but i want you focusing on the application i want you focusing on actually practicing so i'm going to make these quite a few tests and we're going to see how you play pocket jacks what i can tell you is i have been coaching for a very long time i've been playing poker for a long time so i've been playing poker for about 15 years and i've been coaching for 10 years i want to say yeah about 10 no 11 11 years one of the things i like about poker is you don't exactly have to pick one specific thing whereas in american football you have to either be a coach or a player now that's not really what happens when it comes to poker so something i can do with poker is maybe i'm a good journeyman prize fighter that can make good money over the last 15 years but i'm a better trainer and something i can do is i can show up to the gym and i can train my guys one day and then i can go box the next day for myself and i i like being able to switch hit like that i think that's really fun and that keeps me close to the action as well and i've been coaching like this for a very long time which is when i teach myself i'll focus on one thing i'm struggling with or one thing i don't love about my game so sometimes it'll be just small blind play and i'll i'll try to find uh if my buddies have a solver that could help me or if they have some text that i should look at i'll look at that if there's a book that wrote extensively on the subject i'll look at that but then eventually a lot of the times what i'll do is i'll just look at every hand i played in that specific area and i'll quiz myself on should i have done that should i've done this i make quizzes for myself i try to find ways to get more quizzes and that really helps you get better a lot quicker because if you think about pocket jacks you're going to be dealt pocket jacks if you're lucky a couple of times in a session and they both could be really obvious spots it could be just opening on the button with jax and then c betting which is not going to teach you anything today i'm going to teach you the way i t i i learn which is i'm just going to keep throwing jacks at you and i guarantee you by the end of this you'll feel much better now here you have jacks facing on under the gun plus one raise and you're on the cutoff here would you like to fold call or raise now these hands i went ahead and took out the statistics just so you could see them pretty easily and i'll give you i'll give you the approximate live situation or if you're playing online on a site that does not allow huds i'll give you the approximate situation and i'll give you the statistic situation and through those equivalents you'll be able to see there's going to be a similar answer for all of them if it's the same situation now let's say time to reap has been very solid so far so if you were playing live this is someone who looks very comfortable typically doesn't play most of the hands when they do raise uh they tend to come in raising online it's going to be the same thing just you can't see their face and online if you were allowed to use statistics this would be someone who is playing 15 percent of the hands and raising 13 of the time here would you like to fold call arrays i'm going to give you about five more seconds okay time is up in this situation we're going to call and the board comes six of spades five of clubs eight of hearts both of these players check to you here would you like to check or bet i am going to give you about 10 seconds and i apologize there's one more player who called behind you so please be aware of that five more seconds time is up if you did say that how much did you want us that if slight aftermath and ratsov were looser players how much would you want about here we're gonna go for about half pot now the reason for that being if you had very loose players here many loose players if they have a pair they are not folding to the first bat regardless of what it is when it's a multi-way pod and they've hit a pair because if they called pre-flop then they hit a pair and they fall to the first bet they feel ridiculous then they ask themselves what am i even doing here and most of them have never really entertained the thought so most of us humans just do things based on emotions and then we justify it later i don't even think they've ever questioned themselves as to oh if he bet 9k there and i have a6 is my six really good now if you actually have really tight players here you they're going to pay attention to the fact that you bet a little bit more so if these players are a little more solid we're going to go ahead and bet just about half pot now we do face a raise by ratsov to 14k and the other players fold and it's gonna come back to us here what would you like to do fold call or raise hi there it's me again let's work with alex on this one and i want you to write in the comment section below what you would do in this very tricky spot would you fold would you call or would you raise and if you raise how much are you going to raise two go ahead write it in the comment section below remember it is important to factor in all of the information that alex just gave you good luck i'm going to give you the full 30 seconds on this one because it's a little more difficult now ratsov was a solid player so if you're playing live again this is another guy very comfortable with a folding preflop uh it has been comfortable folding on the flop looks very calm online this would be it's the same thing you just can't see the person's face just the folds tend to happen fairly quickly and online this would be another person who's the equivalent of we'll say like 16 of the time pre-flop is playing and 14 of the time pre-flop is raising what would you like to do here i'm going to give you another 10 seconds time is up in this particular situation we should really heavily consider fold in this particular time i did fold so what is the most important thing to ask yourself whenever you're making a big call there's actually two layers to this that if you apply i think the right answer becomes pretty apparent something that is helpful that you need to be aware of when you're playing the limit hold'em is you need to identify a raise that is actually a larger raise than it looks so technically this person made it 14 000. however do you think there's any chance if you shove he faults is that going to happen if that's a tight player well typically a tighter player there is not raising that large if they are not willing to call assassinators 35 000 jam that that would be strange also why what's the other part of this equation i haven't spoken of yet your your hand is not why you want to be making decisions your hand is easy your hand is right there it's in front of you your opponent's hand is the one you want to play and using contextual clues you'll be able to make a very reasonable deduction as to how strong that hand is and the contextual clues are usually going to come through other factors of the hand now if you're looking at this situation what makes you think that 14 000 is stronger this is the fun part about poker we get to be a little bit of a detective when people ask me if you could do anything other than poker what would you want to do and of course this is a party question so i'm not really thinking about practicality or anything but the the stuff i really get into is if you've ever read that book mind hunter are people essentially using psychology to catch criminals that's that's really fine because it's really fun in my job getting to look for contextual clues that will key you into as to what's going on and most people just ignore that because most people go i have jax right now i have an over pair and i'm continuing with that we get to be our own criminal profilers here we get to be our own john douglas we get to be our own mind hunter now here the reason why this raise is stronger than just the 14k that's presented is this guy did this with multiple players act behind now imagine you were trying to let's say you had a seven in his situation would you want to raise that vert with all these with a couple players act behind or would that be a little dodgy what's the other problem you have another shorter stack there with time to reap so if he makes it 14 000 there in time to read shoves there's a lot of money in the middle there so he's made it 14 000 but he's really made it 35 and guys if you decided i gotta go with it with these jacks i am taking my time for you okay i'm going to take my time with these explanations because if i take my time once and spend a couple of minutes on it it's going to be with you for the rest of your life if i just go you should have folded because i said so that's not really going to help you that much or if i give you a pithy reason that you cannot replicate that's not going to help you so i'm going to take my time whenever i do believe it needs to be done in this case this is one that is going to come up all the time with pocket jacks which is there are many situations where jacks are a crappy overpair and they need to be folded and there are poker players i have known for seven or eight years who have never fold an over pair in their life and they pack their bags they buy their plane tickets they wake up early for the flight they get their dunkin donuts coffee they get on the flight they talk to the person next to them i'm going to a poker tournament they land they take the taxi they check into the hotel they sleep they wake up they get a good breakfast they show up for the poker tournament and three hours later they just give away their money there's no way your hand is good here the first thing is you're really calling a guy who just check raised 35k here with two players to act behind second of all what is the most important thought after that once you have those clarifying factors in place ask yourself does he do this with x and x is the best hand that you be does he do this with tense i can tell you if he's solid he's not doing this with times okay i can't remember the official statistics of this person but for this hypothetical we're going to assume this was a solid player and if i did fold here it probably was a solid player or i had reason to believe they were solid player it's totally possible an hour later later i found out differently but we're not discussing this specific guy we're talking about if this guy's tight and there's a lot of times you'll be playing with the same guys live again and again and again if you play in the pittsburgh area you see the same guys like 35 it's the same 35 people you see all the time and all the tournaments you're gonna see that if you play in the baltimore area it's going to be the same 35 people you see all the time in all the tournaments in vegas in a lot of the daily vegas tournaments you see the same like 100 200 people there's some guys you know would never do this with tax and if they never do it with tens what do you beat because there's a lot of guys that know if we play a big pot here most likely my tens are not good because the only hand he can get it in with that he's really doing a great job with is knives which is not a large part of your range if he reasonably believes you could have some pairs here that you're just bet folding after he does this massive raise that's pretty thin but the other thing is why do people not check raise their pair it pairs in multi-way pods do you think you end up going that far in tournaments routinely if you get into the habit of check raising your pairs multi-way when the pots get very big multi-way what tends to be the best hand it's not a pair typically so that's a great habit people get out of really quickly so if he's not really likely doing this with tens and i guess there's a case he could have squeezed with tens i'm not sure the rest of the equation is does he uh do this with a draw so there's a there's a couple of draws here a seven uh to a lesser extent nine ten that seems very unlikely with so many players to act behind in you having such a short stack just going screw it a good percentage of the time so the draw seems unlikely the best value hand you beat seems unlikely which leaves you with a total bluff so a total bluff here would be a six just running and gunning or a six seven i guess an eight seven we forgot to bring those into our range do we think that's likely tighter players are more likely to just peel with those hands than they are too fast play and here's always a really great hard and fast rule if you find yourself really really really grasping for reasons to play your hand then your true motivation is to play your hand it's not to play good poker your true motivation is entitlement driven and there's a lot of people that play poker that way because i mean this isn't a bad thing this is this doesn't make you a bad person but a lot of people show up to play poker they don't show up two-fold and then they wait there for 45 minutes i don't know why this happens with a lot of people but there's eight other people at the table in one of you on average those eight people will have a better hand than you you might even start with the best hand because when the first two out of seven cards show up but when three more cards come it's very likely somebody caught up and there will be people every day it's like telling them did you move to seattle well it's gonna rain quite a bit and they'll still go out and it'll be raining and they'll go oh my god look at this it's raining in seattle who can believe this there's eight of them one of you and there's going to be a lot of times you get 40 45 minutes and you haven't won a ham because there's eight of them and one of you you've had a couple of good hands but the flops are bad and they catch up and that's it and then they'll get to this hand and sometimes this will be guys like a 3 500 tournament like not peanuts and they'll bet they'll get raised and they'll go their main incentive is i don't want to fold again because that's more and i came here to play i didn't come here to fold and the tournament's over i i find if i can get rid of you over playing over pairs i can create many more winners and that was the situation where it's possible you have the best hand but it was highly mother effing unlikely and i'd really prefer it that you'd fold it there it's a much more difficult situation if the last player let's say it's a multi-way pod and you bet and all the guys fold except for the last person the last person decides to uh pump it and that person's more aggressive let's say like a 24-20 or something like that or just somebody who's an action player at the table that is a very difficult situation in which case if you continued that that's forgivable in that situation given the parameters i've given you i would like you leaning on the fold here you have jacks on the button facing a race from the cutoff would you like to fold call arrays couple more seconds five more okay time is up if you have no information here and i gave you no information there and i did not highlight that fact if you have no information you should be three betting all the time there's many people that say jax are drawing hand they say that jax oh i hate jax i hate playing pocket jacks your jacks are most likely way ahead of a cut-off's opening range there so we're gonna go ahead and raise so we raise envisage uh however you pronounce it decides to call and the board comes king of diamonds 10 of spades five of spades and he checks to you quick what are you thinking of right now i'll tell you what i'm thinking of in a minute you have 10 seconds what would you like to do here time is up if you did select b how much did you want about we go ahead and bet 462 and this player calls very quickly and you should always know with most of my hand histories i make most of my decisions within a couple seconds and if i tell you they did something quickly then it likely was bam bam it is check to us here or here would you like to check her back you have five seconds time is up we go ahead and fire and he folds what should you have been thinking here the flop why is that bet so small partly that that was kind of an arrogant jackass thing to do how much i bet there but um that that is small for a reason one of the reasons is if you're three bet c betting a lot as a bluff you want to make sure that eventually you can see that very small and people will more or less just fold and that means the amount you're risking is very small and is likely to work quite often that's really good if you're going to be pumping that three-bet sea dot part of the way that's going to work though is people need to know for the barrels they're coming and this is a great spot for you to fire further barrels what you should be thinking of on this flop right here is how do i get two streets of value if your first thought was oh my god there's a king what do i do that is fear-driven thinking you can't win if you're not trying to figure out how to win you can't hit a target you're not looking at and that happens all the time in the limit hold them what they're worried about what people worry about is getting exploited they're worried about their big hands going down in flames so a couple of things happen here one they don't want to fold their jacks and they don't want to pay off a lot of money so what they do here is they check back but if you're dealing with someone uh this was not america's card if you're dealing with someone on america's card room which is a more educated base in my i typically play on ignition on america's card room i find the players to be much more tactical which i don't like i like money i don't like stroking my ego trying to beat rags what you'll find is if you check back here what do they know you have well you probably would have bet with king 10 right you probably would have bet with fives right probably would have bet with tens so you just cap your range they know at you probably would have bet ace king they know the best hand you could have here is like king queen king jack that is a lot of information for someone to have there now if you bet small most likely you would be betting bigger with a set but it's possible you're just trying to go the guy into a check raise you cap your range a little bit too with that small bed but maybe not as much if you check back there just because i have jacks i want to show down this hand this is the best hand i've had in 45 minutes it should be good these donkeys play all this other crap and when they can win with 10 6 suited are you telling me i can't win with jax that is like so not you know that's not reality on reality's terms man like this is the great thing about poker is people can play however the hell they want and i i get beat by goofy s all the time and what we need to be thinking about is how to make money now here did you even think of all the hands you could make money from if you go bet bet here jack 10 is calling you queen 10 is calling you ace 10 is following you 10 9 suited is calling you 10 8 suited is calling you um nines maybe why do you think i'm dead so small on the flop if i go boom boom i'd probably lose ten nine right if i go boom boom with my bats you see people do this all the time they just mash half pot every single time well that's going to be really hard for this guy to call twice with nines or 109 or something along those lines or sevens if i go small bit bigger bat many times guys with like sixes or sevens go oh cool like queen jack miss two spades miss okay i call because the pot is smaller than they expected on the turn so they don't really think through it and then i just got it's not exactly two barrels but i got one and a half which is better than the one i was probably going to get and then we just buy the showdown because what's going to happen is he's going to check the river to 99 percent of the times most of the time when they leave they hit something and then you you get to decide what you want to do on the river it now if you're being there will be times uh so there are guys that understand he should be check raising some kings there and there's some guys i play with i know check raise kings there a lot and there will be times i go for three streets but you also need to no they can't really rip it with a pair that they turn into a bluff on the river and that's a that's a pretty rare player so most of the time you're going to go that bad by the showdown so let's continue so these two hands at the beginning i wanted to take some time with because one was how to get thin value which is going to happen a lot with jax because there's going to be over cards quite often and one of the times was we just have you know we have a decent overpair but it's really unlikely to be good if we're really seeing the world for what it is as opposed to what we want it to be and that's going to encompass a lot of your hands with jacks the reason most people hate pocket jacks is they can't fold it as a weak over pair in a situation where it's pretty obvious it's not likely the best hand and by the way that doesn't mean a lot of people want to be perfect they're trying to be perfect all the time that doesn't mean one time out of five you don't fold the winner but that doesn't matter because eight times out of ten you're packing it up and going to the rail you would like to be a hundred percent like you would like to know when it's the best hand in a thin spot in other times no when it's a good fold it'd be a hundred percent but the best most professional poker players can do is 80 90 hi sharks i'm back i hope you're enjoying this video and if you are do me a quick favor and click the like and subscribe buttons below and i'll let you in on a little secret if we get over 1 000 likes on this video alex and i will release parts 2 and 3 of this how to play pocket jacks series alex is going to go through every spot you could possibly be in with pocket jacks so that you know how to play them optimally you'll never be scared of them again anyway back to alex here you have jax you're gonna go ahead and well tell me what would change your race size here if anything if you have uh very passive players you might want to raise a little bit bigger here because they're really likely to just call anything and you're slaughtering the range i tend to raise the 3x a lot of the time at this stage of the tournament from the cut off because if people want to play they're just going to call regardless if you went with a larger raise size here that that's fine and we do get called by one day you will cry that is a great screen name and the board comes queen two three and it gets checked to you here would you like to check about a few seconds okay time is up you do go ahead and fire here and this player calls and the turn is the five of spades i guess i should show you that slide before i say it and it is checked to you here would you like to check her butt excuse me guys sorry i had to run away from the mic time's up fire in the hole all right he folds now why did we go back back so you you're not really that worried about anything let's say this person's got king 10 or they got jack tan or they got 10 aided diamonds or some kind of backdoor and they call you here because you already have the pair locked up and it's really hard for the person to know you have the pair locked up because this is a very hit or miss board they're drawing really thinly but they don't know that they're really likely to pay you off and here why do you think okay so we bet really small on the flop to get like the king tens and the ten nines and the the the backdoor cards to call you just because even if they turn a pair most of the time it's not a big deal like if the king 10 turns the 10 that's not a big deal obviously if they hit the king that sucks but that's not the great thing with acr players is they don't really go off the handle that often they uh i mean you'll see it sometimes but not is like when i deal with uh brazilians or eastern europeans it's just like what am i supposed to defend here like what range okay like all right i'm calling oh you turned another pair into a bluff all right cool um yeah anyway now here did you want to go full half pot why is that not a terrific idea you could go full half pot but something i wanted here is god i wanted a call from an ace because they're developing that wheel draw and a lot of times if you bet anything under half pot someone's developing a wheel draw and they got the aside they'll call whereas if you bet afbot this isn't a hundred percent but sometimes guys will go am i really going to call two barrels here would just stays high you don't really want them thinking so i i went a little a little lower here you're kind of hoping they uh the ace two the ace three you don't lose either the four or five you're not losing here we have jacks we are facing a race and a re-wreck what would you like to do now in this hypothetical situation uh you don't know a whole lot about these players but you do know they're fairly aggressive when they do play 10 seconds okay time is up we're going to go ahead and call here so we call and it is checked to us here on this board what would you like to do check or bet you guys should know what i'm going to say you should know in everything i'm teaching you is fundamentals when it comes to the limit holding it's the stuff most of us start with when we're playing in card rooms trying to make money in my private time i'll focus on much more complicated matters and i have coaches that teach me that stuff but this is when i'm just making money this is i'm going to tell you what i'm thinking most of the time so it's been checked to you here would you like to check or bot you have five seconds time is up we're gonna go ahead and check here the turn is the queen of hearts it is checked to you one more time would you like to check or bet i'm going to give you 10 seconds all right we fire and they fold if you did say bet on the flop i think that's okay but i want you thinking of the right things why would we be betting on the flaw we would be focusing on let me ask you this how big should that bet be why most people look at their hand and they play impulsively if you do that myself and a lot of guys that have been doing this our entire adult lives are going to take advantage of you and i would really like you to avoid that so here if you bet 6 000 well then and then they call there's going to be 26 000 in the middle and you're gonna have about 55 and then the next bet is going to be a significant percentage of your stack what's the issue there what are we trying to get value from you got to be looking a couple moves ahead at this point we're trying to get value from tens nines eight sevenths cool maybe some a sox maybe he'd check colon a's high once okay okay this is how winners think how do i get my money now what's the issue with what i just said you gotta check your assumptions what's the issue guys come on you're a criminal profiler let's get into uh this guy's head i can't pronounce that does he think through the entire hand think through the entire night in question the night of the murder think of the evidence does he three that sevens eights or nines let's let let's play back the tape well let's think about that so it was an under the gun raise a guy a guy who's covering him a really really big stack and he three bet fairly large okay and he did that with one two a three a four a five a six players to act behind it's quite a few okay he's got one short stack he's gonna have to call that makes his range slightly stronger but what really makes it really strong is that everybody to act behind does that person do that with nines eight or seven i don't know you don't know either but that's the point let's say let's say let make an estimate here's how you can always tell you're hallucinating and you're crazy because that's the problem being the crazy person the crazy person can't see that they're crazy only other people can see they're crazy so it would really help us this is a scott adams thing i'm quoting by the way it would really help us to know this is really important in poker when we're the crazy person when we're just hallucinating things we want to see are we afraid of seeing are are there monsters under the bed are we on winners to how can we know we're being crazy at that point if you are certain about something that is uncertain you are hallucinating you don't know if he three bets tens nines eights or sevens there how the hell would you know i don't know a lot of guys call that versus the high sack the big sack player so if you said 100 of the time you three bets that i got a c bet here it's like okay i i don't know what that's based on you could even say i've seen him through that in an almost identical situation that doesn't mean anything man he could have just not liked that guy's face you think humans don't make decisions for those crazy reasons he could just be tilted with that person he could just be tilted in general now if you said i think you know i've seen it in a similar situation so i'm 70 percent sure he has those hands so i'm going to fire that's great okay that makes sense that's an estimate it's going to be hard to know how accurate it is but that's a good estimate now if you said no normally this guy's very solid and i think he would just call with those hands so i'd only say like 20 30 percent of the time he's got that so i'm gonna check back here again okay cool sounds pretty reasonable and as we gather more information we'll refine it now uh for i'm assuming i knew something similar to that and that's why i checked back but we need to make sure that we are if you were going to bet there you should probably bet fairly small so you can better get on the turn and get called again by ace highs if at all possible because a lot of times this is a really good let's say we did go ahead and fire there because we thought tens nines eights and sevens which i didn't think uh were three betting there this is a great card for ace king or ace jack to call again the flush draw missed in the queen pair making it less likely we have a queen so you could do that but if you just went bomb bomb it's going to be much more difficult for this player to do that now i decided to check back i did not think this player was three betting tens nines eights and sevens nearly as much here once they check again it's very unlikely they would check a queen again it it's i i guess a lot of a lot of people are weird pot controllers on the site i guess they could still have kings or races but that's not that likely because they probably would bet that like 60 70 80 percent of the time on the flop whatever number you want to give it so but most likely you're facing a high card here like uh tens nines maybe something like that so we do go ahead and fire here and we do fire a little bit smaller here because the majority of the hands combination-wise that we want calling us are our a size but unfortunately we do not get that that is most likely that's most likely an ace high that just didn't want to bother going with the bat bat here you have jax under the gun what would you like to do here how much did you raise to i hope you guys this is always the 2x why one re-jam stack two rejam stacks three region stacks four re-jam stacks if you do not know what i mean by rejam stack that is slang for a stack size that's very easy to re-raise all in that tends to be 10 to 20 big blinds with some more aggressive players that can be up to 25. so we don't want to raise big because then let's say you're the big blind there with 300 000 you go there's no way in hell he just made it 3x there under the gun he's going to fold to my 300k jam maybe i don't feel like putting it in with ace 8 hearts even though i was just tilted a minute ago that's not good so we raise and smudge calls and the big one calls everybody's favorite situation multi-way pots let's do it four clubs four diamonds three of clubs he gets checked you here would you like to check about so let's say smudge is a little looser what would you like to do here if you if smudge is a little looser you can go a little bit bigger here there's one thing i can tell you loose players do not like folding their really good aces when the board comes four four three that is so likely to be a board they think you bricked and you might say but he's got that really short stack behind and they don't care and if they got an over pair do you think they're ever folding ever the other thing you don't want happening is the big blind there he's ready to go if he's got a draw or he's got a three you bet something like 60 000 he can call like miss the turn and then just get rid of it if you bet something big he's just gonna do that i really hope you call and this time it was a bit of a cooler he did have to get it in there but it was really good to explore the bet sizing here you have jacks on the cutoff what would you like to do this is another situation a large raise would be fine but you can do a two x-rays as well so the small blind goes in and calls and the big blind squeezes here would you like to fold call or raise if you notice that most of these situations are pretty difficult there is a reason for that you're not going to learn anything from the easy situations my job is not to flatter your ego it's to help you let's say this guy is a bit more aggressive this guy knows what's up he you've played a lot with him he can play you can uh you know you can get in there and fight would you like to do here okay time's up in a six max situation you're gonna want to put it in here because it's so likely if you look at the stack sizes it's so difficult for you to four bet a really good aggressive player there could be doing that with an extremely wide range just because you don't really have a flat you don't really have a four bet it's a beautiful spot to put you in and it's very unlikely the small blind has anything because the small blind would have probably three bet you if they did have anything so it's a good spot i'm just letting you know this is gonna happen a lot of the time you'll run jacks into queens or something you gotta understand when you have to ask yourself was that the time to get jax in that was now if you open under the gun and a really tight player three bets you under the gun plus one and then a tight player called four bets on both of you under the gun plus two that's the time to not get it in with jax that's when you just want to spew here you have jacks you're gonna go ahead and raise here and it comes around to the big blind who calls and the board comes king of hearts jack of hearts for clubs it is check to you here would you like to check our bet i'm going to give you five seconds if you did say b how much did you want to bat there's 8 55 in the pot let's go ahead and bet larger i wanted to show you this bet quickly for one reason one do you think an ace i even calls on that board many people say these things you always have to check your assumptions and every person i've seen who can make money gambling i'm not just talking poker i'm talking gambling is really good at calling themselves on bs i know many brilliant people that i grew up with far smarter than i am who are very confident and they're just terrible when it comes to gambling professionally because they're so sure of themselves one they'll bet half pot here like every single time they'll never ever question why they do that does it seem like a good idea to never question your moves do you think chess masters ever do that or do you think they take some time and go why did i move here could i have done it differently second of all when you hear your assumptions out loud ask yourself i was very lucky i grew up with uh i had a number of german roommates when i was overseas playing cards and i guess i had german roommates in new york briefly in germany obviously and in malta and it was just a sport for the german players to make fun of you it was just one of their things and like they didn't they weren't being malicious in fact it was pretty helpful and one of the ways they would do that is you would say some reason you did something they'd just mock it and it was pretty good for me because after a couple years i'd go uh you know what would daniel say here right uh or uh yeah it would so something i could imagine me saying is okay i bet small on this more because i thought ace i would call and that i can hear them in my head to this day with their accents going does an ace high call on a king jack four board you have a six of diamonds here is this the board you're gonna call on you have acetate off is this the board you're going to call on now if it were a 1042 board i could see your point i don't see it here so the high cards you're not angling for the high cards so at that point you're not really likely to get i cards to call you so what are you looking for value from well you're looking for value from flush draws you're looking for value from queen 10 what pairs are you looking for value from it's very unlikely the person called you with a four pre-flop you might call with a king 9 but you're not going to call with a 4-9 so it's very unlikely for them to have a jack because you can see that three of them are out of the deck so it's a king you're trying to get value from now all those hands the draws the kings they call big ass bets so betting half pot here is just wasteful if you think that's what's going to pay you if you think high cards are going to pay you obviously you could go a little bit smaller i don't think that's likely but okay but if you just said half pot because that's what you always do and you're not even backing it up with any kind of logic that is worrisome now some people say you have such a great hand why don't you check here that's a really good question the upside of betting here is very high if you get a call here and you can start lobbing bombs because i i can tell you kings do not like folding when the draw draws mess and you might be able to get another pretty large bat out of a draw on the turn because i i don't know why acr players just called way too much the upside is very high when you bet here and obviously the downside's pretty low if you check back i don't think the upside is that high because there are players that just fire out for the hell of it but unfortunately there's not as many of them as there used to be if you check back what do you think your opponent thinks you have your opponent likely thinks you have a pair because you probably would have bet with king jack you probably would have bet it with this set you probably would have bet with a combo draw so they're going to think you're checking back a pair and eights or nines is not very many combinations but there's going to be a lot of combinations of king queen king 10 ace jack queen jack if this person knows anything about anything they're not going to give you that much action so the upside's not that high on a check in my book but it's pretty high on a bat and that does mean this is something you'll see all the time the guy flops a set he bets large for the reasons we just discussed it logically makes sense the guy probably doesn't have fours the guy's probably not calling you with high cards and if he does have a kangas or a draw he's probably not folding anything and then the person will fold and the guy will go that might be the only set i get this entire session it's the only set i'm gonna get today and he folded and they go into this spiral of i'm so unlucky and it's like when i used to do that guys i i used to tell myself get over yourself did it have logic then do it real quickly who's the most important person to focus on right here i'm gonna give you about 10-15 seconds would you like to fold call or raise time is up who did you want to focus on i'll give you a little extra time let's say love mondays this is a great night i like that i'll tell you what it's monday while i'm recording this right now and i'll be real with you i really like talking to you guys it's a fun job if i had a dream career i'd love to coach football like in an at-risk youth area that'd be really fun but the fact i get to work with you guys it's pretty fun and it's monday i'm having a good time thank you for being here thank you love mondays for reminding me i do love this monday so let's say love mondays is a little tighter what would you like to do the fun thing about teaching poker is you get to meet people from everywhere that's really special too that's really cool god i get to learn so much about so many different professions just talking with you guys um and just lives you know different countries we're going to go ahead and call here if the person's a little bit more solid because the raise did come from an earlier position now if this person were very loose what should you do love mondo's let's say well you should squeeze a little bit more because it's unlikely the cold callers have a really big hand because they probably would have three but so we decided to call here which is fine you don't want to get in uh typically you want to play jacks fast for value because most of the time you're going to be ahead of your opponent's range but there are going to be times where you don't have to press it that much now the board comes queen four four here would you like to check her back time is up i'm gonna go ahead and check here and everybody checks around i'm gonna give you guys a hypothetical let's say the turn is the it expects what would you like to do if you did say that how much would you like to bat in that situation if you're going to bet for value you should bet fairly small and you should follow up on the river because if you bet turn check river it's pretty clear you have a pretty crappy pair or a mr although there wouldn't be that many and many players will especially on this site just decide oh weak range i'm gonna bomb see what happens but why do you think we should be a little bit more careful that's as aggressive as i would take it if you wanted to check again i think that's fine why would we be a little bit more careful there let me give you another turn card the jack of diamonds what would you like to do here check or bet i'm going to give you 10 seconds okay if you did say b how much did you want to bet we're going to go fairly large here and agent tetris does call i didn't play tetris in a while that used to be how i decompressed at the end of the day tetris what was that other one super buster move that was a good one it was a great one called egg mania back in the day it was like tetris but it was opposite you tried to build the wall it was so dope i love those quirky japanese games no thinking man you just chill and turn up your system all right the river comes out the two of clubs focus what would you like to do here check it out if you did say bet how much did you want to bat we are gonna go larger here this player shoves what do you think you should do good call this player has a four let's break down this hand why if this turn was an 8 should we be cautious and why should we be bombing when this turn is a jack in a multi-way pot especially on an american site when everybody checks that does not mean there's not a queen out there there are a lot of american players infatuated with pot controlling and i don't know why there's some guys that really love just tabling their hands there's a lot of guys that it's like the worst thing that's ever happened to them if they better top here and get check raised in the end of having to fold and i'll be real with you i think i was entitled when that i used to have that it's one of those things like i hit my hand i'm a great person i deserve for this hand to be good well i don't want to bet and then have somebody raise me because these donkeys raise all the time with just their garbage and i don't want to call and find out some idiot came galloping along with his four seven of clubs no i'll check back i'll let these idiots bad at me my hand's gonna be good a lot of the time and if they do have a big hand they won't get much from me the problem being with that you you end up going into like this mode where it's like all right sweet i flopped top pair quick make the pot as small as possible the game is about capturing other people's chips the most likely value hand you're ever gonna get is the pair if you just decide i'm shutting it down with every pair and i'll let everybody else dictate the pot size they might make the pot very big when they have a better hand and they might not give you anything when they got nothing so when you do hit the jack on the turn you got to ask yourself what's calling here a lot of pot controlled queens are still calling you the first player being solid remember that if the first player is solid there's a lot more queens in their range and americans just like paw control and period so okay when you fire here what's going to call you a 10-9 will call you two diamonds will call you and a queen will call you how much are they going to call you might lose the 10 nine if you build a little bit bigger and obviously not many jacks in the deck you might lose the 10-9 if you bet a little bit bigger you might lose the king 10 i apologize and forgot that one you might lose the king 10 or the 10 9 if you bet a little bit bigger but i don't know about that the stacks are fairly deep so for sure you'll get the flush draw to call you because people do not like folding their draws and the queen's gonna pay off whatever you put out there people pot control queens and then face it really this is why i don't love pot controlling a lot of times i'll be in a spot where let's say i've got sixes and i call out of the big line the board comes 108 six i check standard reg checks back really quickly and i know he's pot controlling most of the time because i've seen him do that a lot of the time the turns of blank i fire out 1.8 x pot on the turn which i do with a lot of draws by the way as well a lot of guys just don't even think about it they just call off call off and the tournament's over so a lot of times their park control line doesn't even work that tends to be young guys that get really edgy about that but when a guy just bombs here on this turn you got to ask yourself what is my queen 10 beating i draw my calling all the river barrels and a lot of people are like nah i'm not going to call another barrel and it's like well do you know how often he fires a barrel and it's like well not really and it's like that's a lot of unknowns dude not saying it's the you can call here with a queen sure but like you have to have a plan you have to if not a plan you have to start asking yourself what do i do with this what do i do with that and start working through it are the the one that blows my mind is this guy bets this guy calls this guy calls and queen tenure thinks some other hand is good because one time they saw a bunch of draws so anyway agent tetris calls and the two of clubs comes out there now why do you think we bomb again with tournament monopoly money when there's flush draws and straight draws missing nobody's folding their top pair you are losing money if you bet like one third pot here or one half pot here because all the cool kids are doing it and he had a four here um i didn't i don't mind his bet his jam trying to think yeah probably a lot of queens back call there i don't necessarily know if i would but yeah okay you know just a tough break there but again if you ever wanted to see that people like paw controlling there you go jax once again under the gun plus one what should you be looking for passive players and three betting players you've got a lot of guys three betting it's an all in you typically want to invite that if you have really deep stack players who are three betting all the time actually we don't love that as much but we can trip trip them up we can't trap them a bit in this case if it's just a generic situation we're just going to go for a two x-rays or if it's just a situation we don't see much we want to do a 2x raise because we want to open the door for that rejam stack to put it in if we just don't know anything else and you should be getting it in beyond them behind what they just did here you have jax in the big blind and you are facing a raise what would you like to do here or fold call or raise time is up this should be a re-raise almost always there are times i will call there with the intention to check ray's call on the flop i typically do that against young guys live because they just go nuts and uh like the let's say the board comes like eight five three with a young guy or sometimes you can get this with uh a more senior gentleman who's tilting let's say the board comes eight five three you check they bet you check raise let's say you've been check raising them constantly you want to know they'll freak out with one pair that tends to be a youth thing but there will be times you just piss off someone who's older enough that they're gonna do it by the way guys like anyone can play any way they want every time i play people get really pissy because they want to see flops it's not pie gal it like people are allowed to do whatever they want it's essentially well it's a it's a strategy game with chips and cards the chips and cards are there to trick you so we call and the board comes jack of spades eight of clubs five of spades would you like to check or bet here i'm gonna give you a few seconds we're gonna go ahead and check and this player bets 21 000 here would you like to fold call or raise 10 seconds if you did say raise what did you want to raise too i don't know why this works live but live right after the person bets look right at the dealer and wave your hand in and go i'm all in and for whatever reason people will just scream and they'll table queen a to hearts like it's the nuts and i don't know if that's normally people do that with a draw or what but it does seem to work i here's a cooler right like he should bet call there because nine ten hearts would be getting it in and hands like that some weaker flush was but if you want to get max value from this after this is one of these weird hands where you can almost play it anyway if you said donkly on this flop okay that's fine i i do donk lead there a lot but when you check jam there if you check jam the second it's on them that a lot of people want here's the thing nobody wants to fold their hand they did not show up two-fold why do people play poker people play poker for the thrill of it they they save the money the money is part of it but they wouldn't show up every single day even when they're not making money a lot of those days if there wasn't something else they're getting out of it and what they're getting out of it a lot of the time is just the thrill of playing it's true like the the days i get to play cards are some of the best days of the month some of the best days of the week so people want to play and that means they don't want to fold because folding is not playing folding is observing if you can master folding you'll make money at this game usually people who get really good at folding are there because they really need the money when i came into this game with missing teeth living out of a garage in my buddy's house you know like it was like that i needed the money right so i got really good at folding really quick and then when i started struggling with poker it's when i started thinking folding was below me but you got to understand the average guy has enough money that they can just lose it and they don't want to fold so you got to give them reasons to play they want to play already you just got to nudge them across the finish line so make your hands look like a draw here what are you looking for regem stacks rejam stacks rejam stacks what do you see here you got two guys who are under 20 big blinds but you got a couple others here with nick gleason and uh ap kick the small blind if you made it a little bit bigger here you could get four people to put it in if you just made it 6k here this is something i'll do live all the time i'll see four guys kind of on the cusp right there and i'll just make it 6k like i'm clueless and people go oh old withered online rag okay i got my ace now i'm all in good whereas if you make it 4.4 nick could call the small blind could call i don't want them calling we can put it in but if i was multi-tabling i'm going to be real with you i probably missed that so we go to 4.4 and we're going to do a multi-way pot because we're going to focus because we are going to focus on situations everyone hates i hate jacks i never win with jacks the board comes king of diamonds two of clubs five of hearts it has been checked to you here would you like to check her back by the way whenever i hear a poker player say i hate this situation or i hate dealing with this player this player is so spewer all i hear is i didn't study before the test you know it's coming if you lived in seattle and you went outside and you didn't have an umbrella i'd blame you because you know it's gonna rain if you say i can't believe it rain today i didn't have my umbrella that's on you every time you play poker there's gonna be crazy players every time you play poker you're going to have a pair and there's going to be an overcard what should you be thinking about right now let's study before the test so we check here and pink fat pig checks behind the turn is the ten of hearts it gets checked to you again here would you like to check about five seconds the other one that always blows my mind is when people as a status symbol tell everybody they're busy they're busy they're busy they're busy all the time i'm busy a good deal at the time but i track my hours and i know what i spend my time on and that is a deliberate choice you can get one of a hundred apps that will help you track time and you should do that back in the day i used to do it with pen and paper but you can get these really cool apps where you you just click a button and say i'm doing this right now i'm working or i'm doing this right now i'm about to go to bed i'm sleeping you click the button and it'll track the time the funniest thing is people who say i work 60 70 80 hours a week they start doing this and they find oh it's like if you get them like really like when you're at work like turn off the work timer when you're at a coffee break or out to lunch with friends or you know a big group of us are going to get coffee even though we just got in at 9 30. there's people that find out they're working 28 hours a week and they're saying i'm out of control i'm so busy it's like we could curb this a little bit here what should you do we're going to check and it gets checked again the river is the ace of hearts it gets checked to you would you like to check or bet poker players should get those apps because a lot i hear this ass all the time i don't have time to study they everybody has time to play nobody has time to study you ever find that interesting i i make them track their hours and we end up finding out they they watch tv 20 25 hours a week which is by the way it's your life do whatever you want but take that tv watching time and may instead of it being 20 hours make it 16 and then just put four hours in this study we're going to check here and they check back why what should you be thinking of here there's always something going on in a hand what should you be thinking of here if you bet out of position you have to ask yourself am i willing to fire three streets if you're not willing to fire three streets that means at some point you are going to check and you are going to cap your ranch and you have to ask yourself if you're prepared for that now if you're ever playing on america's card room i wouldn't recommend or anytime you're playing with more aggressive players i wouldn't recommend capping your range if you can avoid it so we can't really go for three streets here because you have to ask yourself what one of the kids call it now value targets what are your value targets tens nines are they calling three streets probably not now here if you said i'm gonna bet and then i'm gonna bet again what's your issue i'm not saying that's bad but there's some issues do you think these players are calling twice with a 10 they might i'm not sure and what's the big problem with uh a pk ah you see it right you gotta look ahead if you bet and then you can't really bet again right so you could bet you know i mean you could that's fine he's out of position so you don't even have to bet again so but i always hate firing here with pink fat pig there in position when i can't even get two barrels on the guy who is out of position that's my real that's the guy i want to fight so if the well is not too deep they're out of position and the guy who can actually do something to me has a lot of chips that's an issue because it if we're firing twice is he really going to call with a 10 so you can go here with the pot pot control you can go here with the uh check it's also important to put some value hands in your checking range so you're not just always check giving up and this river is a disaster so we check around and we do pick up this pot here you have jacks facing a raise under the gun what would you like to do some reason when the guy names himself america's best i feel like i'm considering re-popping mike lindell like that branding this is the best this is the best thing all right so this guy's a branding guy what would you like to do versus the branding guy aggressive table i'll give you that i don't really know this guy from adam or whatever the phrase is average guy there on a more aggressive american site you should re-pop them and they call why should we re-pop them don't take americans raising in early position to mean anything they do that literally means i want to see the flop if i limp here i know you'll raise me so i'll raise instead and to be fair they get away with that because people don't three bet enough they really don't a lot of people just call here with the jacks and then i go do you think america's best is necessarily folding six five of diamonds there they go no they might raise it okay so the guy's opening six high and you don't three bet one of the best starting hands we gotta get our money most the time so he calls and the board comes king of clubs jack of hearts ten of hearts he gets checked to you here here would you like to check about if you want to find more time for poker study as well there's also apps that will track how often you're playing on your cell phone i thought i spent about 15 minutes a day on reddit or what was the other thing i look at the hell else is the other thing i look at anyway i thought i spent like 15 minutes a day on reddit or like facebook and it turned out to be like 75 and i've heard much crazier numbers if you did say b how much did you want to bet come on his jaws open less fire and he folds so that sucks but why do you think we go bigger here so a lot of these hands guys i just focus on the first bet or whatever like the big if i wanted to show off i just put together all the hands of me like just busting people because if i have one talent in poker it's that people do not fold to me live people don't fold to me online when they see that screen name assassinator they don't fold me so i can land those haymakers right but we have to keep going through different ends and sometimes it's good if they fold so we can just go was this a big bad situation or a small bet situation now here i'm going to ask you a question what were what do you kids call it now value targets what were your value targets your young whippersnappers i'm at the ripe old age of 33. but not um you're not getting a high card to call you here right so what what are you trying to get money from you're trying to get money from pairs okay if he's got ace 10 here does he fold to the first bet let me tell you something that took me a really long time to learn an element hold him when someone has a draw to a broadway straight do you think they fold not often why i don't know is a 10 ever really good there does four outs change the math you wouldn't think so but people don't like folding it i wish i could tell you why i know one of my favorite bluffs is just going bet that jam on broadway boards because a lot of times guys with the gut shots will call twice and just fold like everything but they would have check raised their best hands and it's always one pairs when they check on they fold all the pairs on the river so on the flip side of that when i have a set i'm not hitting the brakes if he's got 1090 he's not folding here you might say 10-9 he raised from under the gun and called the three bit bro they're gambling it's 20 21 the stimis are out queen 10 isn't folding here queen jack isn't folding here king queen isn't folding here king jack king 10. jack 10 is obviously not folding here ace king's not folding here ace jack's not folding here ace ten's not full folding here you got to get the money if he folded a 10 good for him but here's the thing how do you know you're hallucinating how do you know you're the crazy person when you're absolutely certain about something that cannot be known with certainty what percentage of guys do you think can't fold the acetone there it's not a hundred but i'd say maybe 70 80 can't fold it they feel ridiculous especially the stacks are very deep here you got to go for the bigger bat here we have jax let's lay in some bombs here do you want a full color raise that's what i live for you know what i live for live just like shoving 2.5 x pot on the river and watching the guy who for whatever reason just can't let someone else want to pod just go call and then just like it's over you lost i love it you can get a guy so pissed he will let go of his entire tournament just because he doesn't like you just because he three-bent him a couple of times we're gonna raise here you got a couple of guys that could shove on you if you want slightly larger that's okay but they're probably gonna rejam regardless the board comes queen of hearts five of ours seven of diamonds it gets checked to you you gotta know what you're good at when you play card i see guys try to remake their game like every single year there's a lot of guys that do that they play live they're really good at getting people to call really big bets with bad hands and then they just decide to be like gto completely balanced out and over and it's like no no look at it take what works this is going to be especially when you have a really good player you're going to need to be more balanced if you did say b how much did you want to bet you don't have to go that big here here you're going for value you have quite a few value targets but a 5 is going to call you a 7 is going to call you a lot of gut shots are going to call you a lot of backdoor drivers are going to call you you got a lot of money going on for you here a lot of people say i want to check back here i'll check back when i'm playing with guys i play with all the time i'll check back there like four times out of ten or something like that especially with that art in my hand i like that a lot because if the turns are hard that helps me but when i'm playing against guys i'm never gonna see again i just go for value there every time because people don't call too much and there's no reason to balance if they don't if they're not going to adjust what do i care if a guy comes out of the club and sits down with me at the cash game and he's calling everything out of the big blind why would i not make it 10x with aces because in like three weeks he might be back in sober and he might know what that means i'm never gonna see him again you have jax under the gun plus two what would you like to do here if you got loose players at the table you can go a little bit bigger another thing i like to do is let's say uh this wasn't the case but let's say the button was like a 50 15. you make it like 4x because loose players when they're on the button they go oh i'm on the button blah blah blah excuse to play oh he made it 4x4x doesn't look that big to a loose player but it looks big to everybody else so you get a nice big pot with the worst player at the table here we make it 2k marcelo silva goes ahead and calls from the small blind and the board come to jack six four gets checked to you this is another situation a lot of people tell me they have trouble with i got a set sometimes a bet they fold i don't know what to do or they say you know when i get a set and i'm bad and the guy folds i just get so pissed what should you do here should you check a bet should you slow play this time well since i don't think anybody has a pair anymore i don't try to trap seriously like if if you're trying to go for like the check race for value because you assume the guy is going to like bet top pair for value or second pair for value just watch every single time them check back every single time nobody value that's enough nobody bluffs enough people do a lot of calling every data set you ever look at people do a lot of calling so you need a big ass reason to not bet when you have a hand the question oftentimes is how much are you going to bat here you bet a little bit smaller why do you bet smaller if he's got big cards with a club you want him coming along because that's about all that's going to call you sevens eights nines tens we'll call you again you do have to fire if you did say check and i i would check if i'm playing with a guy a certain amount of the time i will check back here especially i like the club in my hand um i wish i could give you a hard and fast percentage i don't really have it it depends on the guy but i just hate checking here especially with anybody who could possibly be an american because i just find they call way too much and it really really is hard not to fire but there's a lot of times guys will like fire have you ever had a session where you had two sets and twice you fired and the guy both times the guy folded sometimes you'll be playing live and the guy will show this ads a lot of the times that guy's gonna check the next time because he feels like he's do something when he flops a set the thing is when you flop a set the guy can't the other guy can't really have much so this idea that you're just supposed to get set over set like every single time because you saw it once and that guy was a really bad player and you deserve it more it doesn't really make that much sense wow you made it almost 90 minutes of pure gold from alex fitzgerald and there's plenty more where that came from i always like to know who made it to the end of the video so if you are here hearing me speak to you right now i want you to try to guess what my favorite poker starting hand is what is it i want you to write in the comment section below the two cards suits included good luck in your games and i'll see you next time did you know that subscribing to this youtube channel will increase your poker win rate by 36 go ahead do it actually that was a bluff you actually have to watch all the content and apply yourself and work hard and put in volume sorry about that [Applause]", metadata={'source':

[Document(page_content="what is up everyone lexie gavin here and today we are gonna do a hand review of a live stream that i played on at the lodge live in round rock texas um i don't know if you guys have heard i think the secret is out but texas is booming for poker right now it really is exploding the games are amazing so if you have a chance i would strongly recommend taking a trip there the cash games are good the tournaments are great it's and it's just like an overall fun experience because i feel like people from texas are just the nicest people on the planet so i love playing there let's get into the live stream you can actually find this one on youtube i think the whole the whole live stream is up there um we are playing a 2-5 no limit cash session there were quite a few straddled pots uh and yeah whole bunch of fun hands so let's get into it all right so let's play this hand here we have um king 10 off in the small blind the poker gypsy he is uh i believe he's a youtuber he's a very fun player as you can see from his aesthetic he's got uh quite the look going right there he limps the button here with ace jack off um i personally don't love limping the button here with his ace track i think i would probably raise this up um but yeah i uh i'm in the king i'm in the small blind with king 10 off i decide to raise it up here to 50 thinking that the poker gypsy isn't very strong here and i have uh john on my left here he is the president of poker atlas if you don't know poker atlas it's a really useful tool that will help you figure out what tournaments are in your area so make sure to check that out it's an app i believe you can download so um all right so here we are we have king 10 off so considering poker gypsy just limped the bun i think that we want to um raise it up here with king 10. we want to disincentivize jon here in the big blind from calling and we want to isolate this to a heads up pot versus the poker gypsy but here john wakes up with king queen and does come in for the call i like him just calling here um he could three bet this for value sometimes but i think that if i were him i just i do prefer the call the poker gypsy also calls as well and we have the king five deuce with hearts uh two hearts flop uh i definitely like sea bedding here as for sizing there's 150 in the pot and um i like going small here uh it's a pretty besides the heart draw it's a pretty dry texture we don't really have to worry about anybody having straight draws here because i think hands like three four are folding pre-flop certainly all of the off-suit three four combos are to be folding preflop so there's really not too much to worry about and we have top pair which means we block top pair which means we block a lot of their calling range so the reason you want to choose a small sizing here is to incentivize them from floating or calling wider on the flop right so when we go small here so we're going uh 55 here when we go 55 then i think we're gonna have some more like ace high floats maybe a hand like um ace ace eight of spades would call here or something like that um you know hand like pocket threes pocket fours would call whereas if we had bet a little bit bigger like half pot or sixty percent pot then those lighter floats those lighter calls are going to be folding the flop so we go small here and of course because john has flop top pair with second nut kicker he is going to come in for the call as well poker gypsy does fold and now i am heads up with john to the turn so the turn here is a three now i think for a little bit and i believe i check right so the reason i am checking here is because when john cold calls my raised preflop i do think he is going to have a lot of hands like king queen king jack that beat me um if i bet here i don't necessarily think i'm gonna be getting called by worse considering i raise pre-flop and i c-bet into two people i mean if he had a hand like pocket nine's pocket tens there is a good chance that he does call one more straight but i don't think that i'm going to get three straights of value um with this hand and if i were to bet i i think that i would kind of be value owning myself like value betting myself um because like i said i don't think there's like much worse that can call so if he had checked back the turn then i am going to be barreling a lot of rivers for value because when he checks back the turn i i um i definitely think he could have a hand like you know an underpair to the king like sevens eights nines that might call a bet on the river because we checked the turn but it looks like he is going in for the bet so there's 260 in the pot and he bets 125. so when we check this turn we're never checking to give up we're not checking to check fold right our hand is still pretty strong um in the event john just had hearts or something um i could see him um putting in the bet here once we checked to him on the flop especially if he had hearts with like no showdown value so um like if he just had like like like jack ten of hearts or something um i can definitely see him betting here whereas if he had like a hand like ace three of hearts um he might check back because he has some showdown value with the three um but he is betting here like i said i am not giving up especially being that i don't block any of the heart combos so we are going to give it a call my plan here um is if the river is not a heart we are probably going to be calling most rivers i think like i said i think our hand is a little bit too strong just to fold we definitely can consider folding um because like i said he is gonna have like king queen and king jack uh pretty frequently i don't think he has ace king because he didn't re-raise us pre-flop so really there's only i mean and of course he can have the sets so he can have set of a set of eight set of threes um i don't really think he has a set of fives because i don't think he's going gonna be calling that on the flop when i see that into two people like if it were me i'd probably just fold like like a hand like pocket fives or and deuces um and i don't think he has any two pairs so i don't think he has king eight or king three or eight three because those hands would be folding uh pre-flop and uh yeah i mean so yeah so i don't know i thought for a little bit and i i did end up making the call here um just because i think that he is bluffing hearts pretty frequently and like i said we don't block hearts and uh when the big blind flats the big blind can always have a lot of flush draws because they're calling more suited combinations than than we are opening right because the big blind is more incentivized to call with you know suited you know suited hands like king three suited king eight suited ace five suited uh whereas we're not gonna be um isolating the limp pre-flop with the hand like king three suited king eight suited so um so we do end up making the call and uh well played by john i kind of think that there really was nothing much to do with this hand um just kind of a little bit of a cooler okay so here we have a raise on the button from the poker gypsy he has four three of diamonds he raises to 150 i believe this pot was um a straddle and a double straddle i think the blinds are 5 10 25 50. so the poker gypsy raises it up to 150 here and i am on the button with pocket kings i raise it up to 500. we got some action here boys and girls so i like my uh sizing here i think anywhere between three times his bed or a little bit higher is good um because of all the straddles the effective stacks are shorter so no need to go too big here um but the reason i wanted to talk about this hand is because i think that this is one of those situations where it's okay um trapping with kings here on the button so calling here on the button is also fine and the reason for that is because we have two very aggressive players still left to act on our left uh we have land entice and we have the poker traveler who are both very solid aggressive players and i know that they're capable of cold forebeding me um polarly so to incentivize them from either calling or four bet squeezing here um i think flatting is pretty it is fine um especially versus uh the poker um gypsy the point of the poker traveler and the poker gypsy the poker gypsy is the guy that just opened the cutoff um because his range is pretty wide in the cutoff um i think that that's another reason why we could be uh trapping here with kings um but we decided to three bet which i think is definitely fine but like we suspected we did squeeze out everybody on our left we actually got a really tight fold from uh the poker traveler here who folded ace queen of spades which um is questionable on on his part just because i i know that he knows that i'm capable of three betting pretty wide here on the button uh especially versus um a tighter player in the cutoff so because i'm certainly capable of three betting um a a completely wide range here you know we have all of our strong hands that we're going to be three betting plus we're going to be three betting uh a lot of our weaker connected hands like jack 10 off king 10 off hands that are a little bit too weak to flat uh we could also be three betting you know some some ace combos like ace five off ace five suited even um so because he because poker traveler knows that i am gonna be three betting wide here i think he might have i think he could have either called or for bet to be honest um but he did decide to make a very tight fold which i was very surprised about so let's see what the poker gypsy decides to do here something from finding nemo poker clubs in austin so the poker gypsy does wind up making the fold good fold by him because yeah that would have been pretty bad for him all right so that is just one example of how you you know a flat on the button with kings is appropriate uh sometimes more so when you have aggressive players on your left if i had a weaker hand like king queen off that i wanted to three bet or like a hand like king queen off i'm more inclined to three bet because i have aggressive players on my left because i know that they're going to squeeze me off my hand at some frequency so something to consider okay so i want to talk about this hand with landon tys so he opens here with queen jack of hearts in middle position excuse me uh he gets your chip stack three bet on by joel on the button with ace king off landon opens to 40 joel three bets to 150. i like this sizing uh somewhere between three and four x is good and then the poker gypsy colt calls the three bet in the big blind with jack ten of clubs um i think this is okay because we are deeper um and i do think that uh joel is he's a very good player and he's definitely capable of three betting a wide range on the button so i think cold calling from the big blind is is fine um now that poker gypsy did call i think landon is more incentivized to come in for the call as well not that i think that he would fold uh the queen jack of hearts to one three-bet pre-flop regardless so he's just getting a little bit better of a price so um pretty good flop for the poker gypsy there it checks to the three better uh joel does decide to check back so i want to talk about joel's check here on the flop i really like this uh this is not a very favorable flop for ace king this is much better for his opponent's range than his the big blind and landon can both have some nine combos uh definitely queen jack type combos a lot of tens in their range especially the poker gypsy i think poker gypsy is going to have um a lot of 910 suited combos uh maybe him like ace 10 suited things like that so um good check by j uh by joel uh if this was higher cards i think a c bet would be would be better uh it checked around uh now to landon who is going to bet 350 with his open-ended straight draw um i like that he is betting this turn he only has queen high he can improve to a straight um and like i said he can favor this range pretty well so i definitely like the bet i like the sizing joel makes a good fold here let's see what poker gypsy does poker gypsy makes the call uh yeah poker gypsy is certainly not going anywhere with the clubs and the uh top pair now i think that um gypsy could have led the turn um but i think checking checking is also fine um he could certainly get value from queen jack type hands which is why he could have led the turn but he does block block some of those queen jack combos so i think a check or a bet on the turn is fine so so this is interesting so landon bets 350 and poker gypsy is raising now which is very strange uh this line doesn't make that much sense i think that um a check check raise looks a little fishy i think that once the flop checked around i think that the poker gypsy should be betting a lot of his nine combos um just for protection um so i i do think this is a little suspect i don't think that landon is going to go anywhere especially considering it's only a min raise to him but he does make the fold so good fold by landon um yeah if this was me i might find a call to the min raise i guess it's fine to fold just because um yeah i guess a fold is fine because you kind of have to take out some of your um straight outs like if uh if the king or eight of clubs came on the river then landon has improved to a straight but could just be drawing dead to a flush so yeah i think it's a good uh good lay down by landon all right so here we have uh jakov he has pocket tens under the gun uh there are no straddles in this pot so he raises it up to 50. the poker gypsy calls under the gun one with jack knight of clubs i have king of clubs jack of spades i come in for the call as well uh it wouldn't be terrible to fold here but i am definitely not in the business of folding especially on a live stream gotta give the people a show you know so everyone else folds and we see a pot three way to the flop queen ten four rainbow uh jackoff has flopped middle set and decides to check it which is very sneaky here uh checks to me and i am gonna bet the open ended straight draw here once they both check uh i don't really presume them to have anything too strong now granted i was wrong because he was slow playing a set but if i were him if i were jackoff with the set i would continue betting here there's a couple of reasons one when i flop middle set um i typically uh don't trap i fast play it a little bit more because you're not blocking top pair so when you're not blocking top pair you're not blocking your opponent's calling range right so um and with poker gypsy flatting on his left and me flatting on his left i think that we both can have a lot of queens in our range i think we can both have a lot of uh queen jack uh queen 10 queen 9 type hands maybe even queen eight suited if we're really loose um so there's just a lot of hands that i think that jackoff could get that could get value from uh plus uh his hand does require a little bit of protection i know that there's no flush draw but there are some straight draws out there which he doesn't block either of them so king jack jack 9 are definitely possible uh even ace jack for a gut shot so i if i were him i would definitely see bet here for value and a little bit of protection but he decides to check i do bet 105 um and jackoff i believe calls yep so he calls so he is still uh trapping this and poker gypsy calls as well now i don't think there's anything wrong with poker gypsy's call um at all he's he's also flopped open-ended just unfortunately for him the lower end so checks to me there's 489 in the pot now i think this could go either way um i do believe i end up c-betting here but i don't hate checking um just because i um our opponents could definitely have some queens in their range which they're most likely not going to be folding once i do bet so um so that's like one argument for checking back i could just check back and hope to realize my straight equity on the river um because i don't necessarily think i'm getting folds by uh king queen and ace queen and queen jack i didn't really think that jackoff had too many queens because he just checked the flop so i mean he could be paw controlling with like ace queen but i don't i don't really see why he would do that i would imagine he would see bet a hand like ace queen and and uh king queen and queen jack i mean queen jack might check but certainly c betting ace queen and king queen so i didn't really think that he had too many queens and uh i didn't block any of the tens i do block some of the 10 combos like king 10 and jack 10. um but i i just thought you know i have king high i could improve to a straight they could get you know i could get folds from the both of them um i didn't i wasn't too afraid of jackoff's range just because like like i said ace queen you know aces and kings most likely are going to be c betting there especially because um the poker gypsy and i could both have a lot of queen and 10 combos that he could get value from if he did have aces and kings so i think this could be a check back but i did decide to bet and if i am going to bet i like going big which i did i bet 350 um because again i only have king high and i really do want the fold so i don't want to go small here and send and incentivize them for calling i believe that if i had bricked the river if they had called and i bricked the river i'd probably just give up but if i had chosen a smaller sizing on the turn then i would probably end up following through with more rivers because they're going to have wider calls when i choose a smaller sizing on the turn so i could probably get a hand like ace 10 to fold if i bet big on the river but uh the jackoff now is deciding to put in the raise it's just a min raise to me so i'm never going anywhere here he's just given me way too good of a price to draw out on him uh which spoiler alert i do end up getting there it's always so much fun to hit the gin card love it so much here i was just like praying that he had a hand like ace queen now as played if i were jackoff i certainly would keep betting here um i think my range looks a lot like ace queen and king queen um if i had ace queen like i would likely three bet it but he did raise from early positions so i do flat that sometimes um so he decides to check which is really interesting obviously i'm gonna be betting for value here let's see an over bet here so there's 1900 in the pot let's see what sizing i go with um i think that i probably i honestly don't remember what i wound up doing but i'm thinking now that i should probably go for a slightly larger sizing just because he did check raise me on the turn um so i think anywhere between little over half pot and like 70 pot would be good um you don't want to go too big let's see what did i do i went 9.75 okay so about half pot you don't want to go too big here because um the ace could be a scare card so in the event he had uh king queen then he might fold to the ace river um i don't think he has king jack very often because he didn't continuation bet it um so i think this my sizing might have been a little bit too small i probably could have gone a little bit bigger uh if i had known he was trapping with a set obviously i would have bombed it so yeah unfortunate river for him but he uh probably should have just continuation bet the flop and uh when he did check raise me he probably should have gone bigger on the turn as opposed to just a min raise which is basically pricing me pricing me in uh to calling with all of my draws don't quite know that all right so here i have eight six of hearts in the hijack i decide to raise it up there are no straddles this hand so i raise it up to forty dollars and i get a call from the poker traveler who has ten nine off suit in the big blind uh keep in mind poker traveler is a very aggressive player so i always consider that when i'm playing against him king deuce deuce uh with two diamonds and a heart i have backdoor hearts and only ace high so i do like a sea bet here there's 94 in the pot and i bet 30. i like betting about a third pot here just because uh the poker traveler is going to have bricked this very often uh there's not you know it's it's a very i mean besides the diamond draw there's really no other draws it's a very dry texture um if he had a hand like 10 9 i would imagine he would just throw it away but he does end up getting stubborn here so he decides to call with nothing absolutely nothing and uh i hit a six of diamonds on the turn and he decides to lead here so i think that this is uh just a really uh no offense to poker traveler but a pretty weak play here um i mean i don't really see him leading with too many of his king combos and i don't think he's got any really strong king combos because he just flattened the big blind um so i don't think he really has ace king king queen things like that um he's probably flattening king jack but i don't really see why he would lead the turn there so to me it just kind of looks like he has uh either nothing and is just trying to take it down on the turn or maybe he has like more of a vulnerable hand like pocket fives like black fives or something uh that he's hoping to get a bet you know a fold out on the turn by me um he might also think that i'm just like c betting this board with a hundred percent of my range which i pretty much am so uh maybe not aces i might not see but aces here um or ace king uh just because i don't necessarily think i'd be getting three streets of value but my point is i just don't really believe him so if this turn was anything other than a six or an ace i probably would consider raising here uh and again i don't think he ever has a flush because like why would he lead a fl lead a flush here um maybe he's gonna be leading some of his weaker flushes but i would imagine that he would um just trap more with that and either check call or check raise probably chuck raise so if this wasn't an ace or six uh you know which has now given me showdown value i probably would have raised a lot especially if it was like a high card like a queen or a jack and he led um then i really really wouldn't believe him so i would probably put in um maybe like a 300 raise here but i do end up making the call i obviously i'm not going to be uh ever folding here um especially since i take him as weak playing poker study for a while he's always one too all right you know so the river is the nine of hearts uh and he decides to check so when he checks now i um i'm not i'm definitely not gonna turn my hand into a bluff i think when he checks he is more inclined to have some sort of showdown value which he does i think that if he didn't pick up a pair of nines he's pretty much going to be betting every river in which i would probably make a pretty a pretty loose hero call versus him um if it was a diamond river then i certainly would fold uh just because i do see him leading the turn with a lot of his like uh naked diamonds maybe just like maybe he just has like the ace of diamonds or like queen of diamonds or something that he's leaving the turn with so if it was a diamond i'm probably folding uh if um considering he's checking i'm always going to be checking back and if it was anything other than a diamond uh or like a king i probably would um just bluff the or just uh here i'll call him on the river but i do end up checking back uh and he rivered me all good interesting hand by the poker traveler okay so here we have jackoff who is calling with king ada spades under the gun plus two poker gypsy also limps and i decide to limp behind with jack eight of diamonds here a little bit loose but i think uh calling in position on the more recreational players is fine plus like i said i am not in the folding business on a live stream all right so we have quite a multi-way pot here there are six players to this flop flop is nine ten of spades deuce of hearts so i have flopped the lower end of the straight draw here checks to the poker gypsy who bets 50 with his top two pair um i definitely like betting if i were him uh he certainly has to worry about protection from the flush draws and the straight draws which he blocks neither of um i am with so many players in the hand i think that there's so many different ranges he can get value from certainly a lot of 10 combos ace 10 king 10 queen 10 all of those hands should be calling uh so i like his bet his sizing's a little big he went almost the size of the pot i think he bet 50 in a 60. so if i were him yeah somewhere around 45 so i probably would have gone 50 isn't bad at all um i decide to call here with the open-ended straight draw now with the hand like this especially so multi-way um i have to assume that i do have to get there because like i said we are against up against so many different ranges and in a in a limped pot um i do think that this uh nails a lot of their uh limping range um and i don't limp behind very often but a hand like jack aided diamonds i don't want to necessarily isolate pre-flop and and bloat the pot with jack eight uh so like i said i decided to come in for the call but so i do have to be uh kind of cautious with my draw here uh but obviously i am gonna i'm gonna make the call and you know when he is when gypsy is betting into uh five other players you have to give him some credit you do have to give him uh more credit than if this was like a heads-up pod or a three-way pot so the turn is the five of diamonds i did break out here um so poker gypsy does continue the aggression he bets 400 into 860. now i thought about this for a little bit i know i have the open end straight draw but i um you have to consider the fact that because there's two spades on the on the flop if i do end up improving to the straight but uh the the queen or the seven are spades um then i could just be drawing dead to a flush so do and i'm also drawing to the lower end of the straight so i i could be drawing really thin uh verse queen jack so um just considering he's bending into so many players on a a board that i do think that i have to end up getting there and i do have to eliminate some of my outs um because of the spades i end up making the fold here i think that if this was like a like a heads up or a three-way pot i i can consider raising the flop sometimes i definitely like a raise on the flop especially if i had um like if there if the deuce of hearts was a deuce of diamonds i like raising it even more because i could continue barreling on on all uh diamond turns and i can obviously improve to the street so i wound up making the fold uh jackoff here decides to call with his spade draw he bricks and decides to just check pretty surprised that poker gypsy here decided to check back if i were him uh yeah i know that uh jack gate gets there but i think like like i did i think a lot of jack 8 combos fold the turn so if i were a poker gypsy i probably would have bet the river for value now um you know if if jackoff didn't have a spade draw and just had like a a king 10 type hand he might make a hero call uh thinking that poker gypsy could have could be betting bricked spades so i think i would have gone for value um verse jackoff i don't think the poker gypsy has to worry about um like but like uh sets here um because i think a set would have raised either the flop or the turn so i think poker gypsy missed out on a little bit of value here all right so let's take a look at a hand between the poker traveler and landon tice so it looks like landon decided to straddle under the gun to 20 i'm sorry decided to straddle 225 and poker traveler under the gun makes it a hundred and five dollars with pocket queens here so folds around to landon and landon decides to make the call with seven four of spades defending his straddle i like it especially considering that they are super deep uh landon sitting with with 4k poker travel has over 10k uh so i like landon's defend here um to poker traveler so uh eight six two spades kind of a fun flop for for uh landon uh if poker traveler had c bet uh i think lennon has a decision whether or not he's gonna check raise or check call he's certainly not going anywhere with his flush draw and gut shot um i think because the fact that poker traveler can represent a lot of the kings ace king king queen king jack king 10 maybe king 9 suited um i think that because of the king on the board uh there is argument for landon to just check call if poker traveler had c bet um if this was like uh let's just say if this was eight six deuce with two spades i like uh a check raise on landon's part if poker traveler had bet because uh then the the texture of the board isn't threatening versus the under the gun range because the under the gun range can have a lot of broadway combos that miss the flop and and landon can certainly represent uh the range advantage there if it was eight six two three six eight six three um so i think check raise for landon uh with a lower flop and a check call with the king high flop um but this is all moot because poker traveler checked back the flop just speaking in you know hypothetically so eight of spades or eight of hearts on the turn here i think if i were landon i would like a lead here uh to me it looks like poker traveler is aware that this is a pretty good board for the big blinds range in which he is trying to keep the pot small um i also think his hand is a little transparent i think uh it certainly does look like poker traveler could have a ham like pocket nines tens jacks queens um even some kings i i i think king's like his strong kings might continuation bet here um for protection from the flush draws you know and to charge landon for his draws um yeah it's a it's a draw heavy board he's you know he's could be afraid of spades nine seven five seven um landon can also have some two pair combos that that poker traveler can't like um eight six which is now improved to a boat on the turn um and king eight suited as well so poker traveler definitely has to be uh careful here with this bet i do think he should call one straight because i think it would be uh a little bit too passive for poker traveler to just check uh check check flop check flop and then fold the turn so i do think he has to call one straight which he does traveler makes the call with the ladies and we'll see a river and the river is a jack of diamonds so now the question is does landon continue the bluff here he has to assume he's never winning at showdown with his seven high so it's either he has to bet or just check give up knowing he's gonna forfeit but that's not landon style he goes for the gold here and he puts in the over bed there was like 800 on the there was like 800 and something in the pot and he's betting 1500 which is pretty awesome i like the over bet here this is putting so much pressure on the poker traveler to to call with his queens here um even if poker traveler just had a king i mean i'm sure he would find the fold just because so many of the draws bricked this this sizing on landon's part is very very polarizing um i think that this is like screaming bricked draw or screaming the goods i think that landon certainly can have a lot of eights in his range here and like i said he very well could have um the the full houses that that poker traveler can't have um i think poker traveler uh kind of capped his range when he bet the when he checked the flop because i think a a hand like top set of kings is going to be continuation betting versus that verse landon and that texture of the board so i think landon pretty much knows that he kind of has probably like a middling pair like pocket tens maybe queens um and yeah so i i really like this sizing um on landon's part and like i said earlier landon certainly can represent all of the um you know a lot of the boats that that poker traveler can't have like eight six suited king eight suited um pocket sixes i think pocket sixes would probably if poker traveler had pocket sixes i would imagine he would fold that that um at some frequency under the gun uh especially um considering that the table is pretty aggressive so yeah this is pretty pretty cool by by landon i i really do like this bed a lot poker traveler is gonna have a big decision to make so he thinks for a while here i would too landon just looks so relaxed when he's bluffing graduation my dog won a race basset hound races today that was a great video by the way and he does lay it down so really good fold by poker traveler i mean being results oriented not a good fold by poker traveler but if it were me i would probably i probably would have folded it just because like i said it's a really good uh really good board for landon um and that sizing i mean he just has to really um yeah he has to really have it in order to call a sizing of that size all right everyone so

[Document(page_content="we're gonna be discussing how to make the most out of a small bankroll so here's a question i'm a new member with a small bankroll and struggle with knowing the best way to grow my bankroll can you give some advice i mean first things first most people as far as i can tell don't like to talk very openly about their finances why i don't know but they don't do it and i think you probably should especially whenever you are talking to a coach somebody you're asking for advice right now you certainly don't need to have your finances out for everyone to see there's probably no purpose in that but if you want to get good information from anyone you need to give them as much information as you can about your actual problem otherwise they're not gonna be able to help you right because like i don't know what this question actually is is this saying someone who's trying to become a full-time professional poker player if so my advice for them is gonna be very different than my advice for someone who is just playing for fun and you know i would ideally like to win but doesn't really care at the end of the day so anytime you are asking someone for help or for information you need to give them as much information as you reasonably can so they can give you as good of advice as they possibly can all right first things first figure out what you want are you trying to go pro is the goal to quit your job and only play poker right i think a lot of people get in their minds yeah i want to be a professional poker player but uh no you don't if you have a family and kids and responsibilities you probably don't want to be a professional poker player unless your other options are quite bad right the reason you see a lot of youngish people getting into poker or people my age who started when they were 18 getting into poker is because whenever you're that age you have no dependents right you have no kids typically you have no real responsibilities and you also don't really need to make money and and on top of that you don't really have any other good opportunities now some people do have good opportunities but like as a kid i had just like marginal opportunities i mean i like i was going to college i had a scholarship to where i didn't need to make money if i knew if i graduated college i'd get a job making like 50k a year being an engineer and there's nothing wrong with that fine perfectly fine good prospects but it's not like i'm going to get super rich doing that and also i probably didn't know if i enjoyed it that said if you are already in a career and you make a decent amount of money and it's very stable and it pays your bills and then some you probably don't want to try to become a professional poker player next are you just trying to make a little money look i get emails all the time for people saying hey i want to get into poker and i want to learn to make i don't know 500 per month how do i do it first things first you're never going to make consistently 500 per month some people get in their heads all right i'm gonna play until i make 500 and i'm done for the month but like that's just ridiculous right because some months in theory you could be making a ton some you're gonna make less and really it's not that all that much in your control as long as you are studying a lot putting in good volume and extracting value and if your ideas i want to make exit dollars per month you kind of need to get that out of your head because that's just really not how poker works and it's also very difficult to progress your bankroll and grow as a poker player if you are consistently taking some amount of money out of your bankroll now i realize that some people want to make money from poker but if you look at a lot of the best poker players in the world or a lot of the poker players who have had decently long careers not even playing the high stakes or playing medium stakes a lot of them don't really cash out all that much of their bankroll they kind of just leave it there and you know they may invest it in stocks or cryptocurrency or gold or whatever but they're not really spending the money right and i realize everybody has expenses right everybody has these you know you got to pay for your housing you got to pay for your car if you have a car you got to pay for your insurance get it you got to pay for food right you got to buy all these things but ideally you want to keep all these expenses minimal but that way all of your money gets put into things that you could in turn resell if it comes to it right um one time i had a big downswing in my bankroll and luckily i had a bunch of gold sitting on the side sold some gold didn't want to but you know that was a thing that i thought made the most sense to sell at that time and i did it it's kind of like moving down in stakes the options are move down on stakes or sell some gold and ideally you want to make sure that whatever money you get you're not really just spending on nonsense but instead like effectively investing in things that you could resell if it comes to that uh i say this a ton you all know this all you have to do to win is find a game you can beat play a ton and keep a proper bankroll that's all you really have to do next are you playing to pass the time these are effectively people who are playing for fun right are you playing for fun if you're playing for fun in reality i don't think you need to devote all that much time to studying and getting good now obviously you need to study some you need to get a little bit of experience you need to make sure you're not just torching your money right because i can tell you it's not fun to play poker if you're consistently losing even as a professional sometimes you just have bad down swings it's not fun when that happens so in order to make sure that you are not in just a consistent long-term horrible downswing because you're bad you need to study you need to get at least some level of competence which is why i have things like the tournament master class and the cashier master class right to get you up to speed that said if you are playing for fun slash to pass the time as a hobby right you should probably just play small games don't become a degenerate gambler to some extent because the problem is that with some people perhaps like myself sometimes once you get some level of i don't know once you get used to playing for some amount of money you don't really want to play for less money and that will inevitably result in you having to play at the same level or higher whenever your current level is not available forever you may play higher if you keep playing higher and higher and higher next thing you know you're playing high stakes in games that you are going to be a big loser in and you're just torching your money right and especially if you are working on a limited budget like you're not just super rich you can't really go around playing high stakes poker games because imagine if you play even i don't know 510 no limit or thousand dollar buying tournaments and you are a small loser you might be losing i don't know 25 50 100 per hour if you're losing 100 per hour every time you go to the casino if you play an 8-hour session you're losing eight hundred dollars per day you gotta have a good job to lose eight hundred dollars per day and there aren't many hobbies that cost you eight hundred dollars per day maybe uh going out fishing on a boat with seven motors or something will cost you 800 a day in gas but not a whole lot cost you 800 per day it's hard hard to spend 800 bucks a day and with poker you have like literally nothing to show for it at least with um when you go fishing you maybe catch some fish or something when you go golfing you at least get to go out there and play golf and have an experience when you play poker you just sit there and lose 800 per day on average it's not fun not good so ideally you want to keep the games you're playing small especially if you are aware enough to realize you are not going to devote a lot of your time to getting good at poker right all you have to do to win is find a game you can be played a lot keep a proper bankroll this implies you have an adequate level of skill you gotta study some going through the master classes where the 30 day challenges on poker coaching are a great way to get up to an adequate level of skill somewhat quickly for most games especially the like non-highest stakes games next play your game a lot don't be afraid to get in there and play like i said the goal is not to like win some amount of money than quit the goal is to extract value and realize you're gonna make x dollars per hour there's gonna be a lot of variance and understand that sometimes you have good runs sometimes you have bad runs and that's completely out of your control um next keep a proper bankroll okay we're gonna talk about that a little bit so which game is ideal for you first things first start off playing tiny stakes now i realize some sites online have tiny stakes games that are effectively not beatable because the rake is too high same thing in live poker right if you're playing tiny stakes no limit hold them they may rake you to death there so make sure the rake is beatable if you have any rate questions feel free to ask them i'm sure we've discussed drake at some point um so but you want to start off playing small so that you can figure out if you actually have an edge right you need to find a game you can beat find a game you can beat now obviously if you are in good financial shape tiny stakes for you may not be the same as tiny stakes or someone with no money back when i first started i had 50 right you can't play all that big with fifty dollars so i played the smallest stakes game that that were available at the time on the internet whenever i was 18 years old i played the tiniest games that were available because i did not know if i was good at poker because i had literally no experience and i wanted to prove to myself that i was actually winner before actually playing for bigger money and also the nice thing about that is that you grow your bankroll along the way and uh the nice thing about poker is that to some extent your bankroll that you have one from poker not what you buy in for but what you have one from poker is kind of indicative of your skill level especially in cash games not so much in tournaments because you can just get lucky and win a big tournament and or win a big field tournament have a lot of buy-ins but in general in cash games at least your skill level is somewhat equal to your bankroll or what your bankroll allows same thing for things like sit and goes where there's not nearly as much variance basically as there's less variance in the game your results are more and more addictive of your actual skill level all right so which game is ideal for you cash games are great because you can play as much or as little as you want whenever you want which is what works for most people's lives right most people don't have a ton of time to devote to their hobby or their new potential career right because you have other stuff going on um i mean like whenever i was playing poker i was going to college i was working a job i was actually working two jobs and i got to fit poker in for like four hours per day right two hours per day whatever not a lot because i had a lot of other stuff going on so and because of that i could not play multi-table tournaments and really i didn't play multi-table tournaments at all until i was i don't know like 19 or 20 years old it's like a year or two of playing online with no multi-table tournaments at all because i could not devote eight hours to sitting there and playing right because i had other stuff going on um that said the problem especially today with cash games is that they're usually much tougher than tournaments at comparable buy-in levels however live cash games are still great in most casinos in most places you can find a you know 2-5 no limit game that is reasonably soft that if you're good you can beat for 50 dollars per hour or so and there won't be a ton of variance so live cash games i think are great online cash games maybe not so much because everybody online is pretty good at this point um cash games are usually pretty low variance compared to tournaments like i said your results are going to be somewhat indicative of your skill level especially over a decently big sample what's a decently big sample if you play i don't know eight hours per day five days per week so like a full-time job at a casino and you do that for i don't know three months you'll probably have pretty indicative results i mean back when i used to play at blajo every day i play 5 10 or 10 20 blajo every day and i don't think i had a losing month to be fair i was playing like 70 hours a week so it's almost like i'm playing two months every month compared to what most people do but like i mean i'm staying there with 100 per hour win rate maybe 100 per hour i'll sit there and grind all day right especially if it's like kind of low risk and it really was pretty low risk so cash games are nice for that tournaments require you to play long sessions but they are usually quite soft even at the high stakes i mean in the uh the ten thousand twenty five thousand fifty thousand dollar tournaments i played recently at u.s poker open they were very soft i mean at every table they were probably it was eight handed tables they're probably five good players three clearly recreational players tournaments are pretty soft there's usually some pretty bad players in tournaments and that's because a lot of the players in tournaments like the idea of i'm going to go and i'm going to lose one or two buy-ins i know what i'm going to lose if i lose and i know i'm going to play for a few hours on average if i win i'm going to spin it up a lot they're like it's like a parlay right and that leads to the recreational players who gamble at tournaments usually being pretty gambling uh tournaments are very are high variance it's important to realize tournaments are high variance right um a lot of people don't fully understand the variance there's a website called pokerdope.com i think they actually change the name i forget what it is now but pokerdope.com if you go there it'll redirect to the site and there's a tournament variance calculator there go there play around with it check it out you're going to see that there is a lot of variance and you have to understand that so if you're playing on a small bankroll if you don't have all that much money you either need to be playing really tiny snakes tournaments in which case your win rates are not gonna be that high like if you're playing a one dollar tournament you have a 50 return on investment you make 50 cents per game it's not all that much money let's say you play four per day you make two dollars per day on average still with a lot of variants right that's that's not a lot of money right that said if you make two dollars per day you have a hundred dollars to start let's say you double your bankroll in 50 days think about that if you can double your bankroll every two months it's pretty good it's pretty good and and you really can like literally double it at the smallest you can go from 100 to 200 to 400 800 to 1600 within what a year that's five doubles yeah you can reasonably do that so in a year you can 5x your money for small amounts of money now as you start playing bigger and bigger stakes your edge is going to go down and that's going to result in you not doubling every x number every two months or so it becomes more like every four months or every eight months but you know that's fine because you're playing for bigger money right all right bankroll requirements if you are not a professional even if you are a professional do you have a disposable income stream like money that is coming in consistently that you know you can reasonably lose and you'll like your life will be okay some people have this some people don't for the longest time in my poker career i had no other money and no other opportunities now i have a training site pokercoaching.com and i have books and all this stuff brings in a little bit of money here and there and that makes it to where i could potentially play a little bit bigger for example 50 000 buying tournaments are a little bit out of my budget but you know if i lose it's okay make content for a month you'll be good to go right but like if you have a job and you're making let's say you make i don't know a hundred thousand dollars per year 50 let's say 50 000 per year right you have a reasonable job making 50k per year if your expenses each year are like 20k or 30k because you're doing what i said and not spending a ton of money let's say you spend 20k per month i'm sorry 20k per year on expenses that means you have 30 000 of disposable income now obviously you should be investing some of this money right for retirement or you know in general but if you have let's say twenty thousand dollars per month or twenty thousand per year of disposable income but you can reasonably lose let's say twelve thousand dollars of it and you'll be fine right that is a thousand bucks per month they kind of have a disposable income and it's almost as if if you know you're going to play poker for let's say 50 buy-ins that gives you effectively 20 buy-ins per month every month you basically have like an unlimited bankroll to some extent at that point right because you're not going to play all that much you're going to clearly win some sometimes and if you have a thousand dollars per month to play with you don't you like you can start playing 50 tournaments immediately with a thousand dollars in your bankroll 20 buy-ins because you know you've already partitioned this money every month for the next 12 months let's say to figure out if you're any good at this game right so if you have disposable income then you don't really need to keep all that much money on hand because you're gonna con consistently make that money now obviously all jobs are not consistent i would recommend not losing 25 of your money each year or whatever it is playing uh any game any poker game but you don't have to be saying there were like 200 buy-ins or 300 buy-ins because you basically have that money coming to you in the future now obviously if that income stream changes usually this only matters when it decreases or goes away you gotta knit up and don't look for poker as a way to gamble and try to get rich quick unless you very clearly have proven that you have an edge and even then it's it's very tough poker is a great hobby hard profession all right uh if you do not have an income stream like most professional poker players don't have any other money coming in you need to keep a lot of cash on hand not necessarily cash like liquid cash it can be in stocks or other semi-liquid assets you want to put it in things like a house because if you put all your money in a house and you need some money you may have a problem this happened to me in the past i remember when i said i had to sell gold while i was sitting there with i don't know 500 000 in property that i could not reasonably liquidate i would have loved to take five hundred thousand dollars out of houses and just sell twenty thousand dollars of it right um instead i had to sell little chunks of my gold and i had less than 500k in gold i don't know let's say i had 50k in gold i had to sell 20k of it had to sell 40 of my gold i would have much rather sold you know five percent of my house or houzz is so you don't really want to be taking your money and locking it up too much locking up something's good but at the same time if you are clearly a professional you don't want to super lock it up because then you can't access it and sometimes you will need to access it especially if you are playing in games that reasonably push the boundaries of your bankroll um okay so assuming you have a decent edge keep roughly 30 buy ends for soft cash games usually live cash games i think 30 buy ends is fine if you start dipping down below to like 20 you should probably move down for sure um if you get down like 29 i'm not gonna say you should move down but if you get down to 20 you probably should move down the nice thing about moving down when things go poorly is that you basically double your bankroll in terms of buy-ins right um in cash games like buy-in is in my mind about 100 big blinds okay so that's that's relevant uh for tough cash games these will be like online cash games need something like 100 buy-ins okay so 100 100 blind buy-ins for tournaments for small field tournaments where you have a reasonable edge let's say 30 50 something like that you're gonna need roughly 100 buy-ins it's a lot remember there's a lot of variants in tournaments and for large field tournaments you need substantially more buy-ins because the variance is going to be bigger you're gonna have substantially bigger swings in tournaments where almost none of the feel gets in the money just because you don't win all that often right because you know if you're if you're playing a thousand person tournament you're gonna make the final table one in a hundred times imagine you play a hundred tournaments per year and they're thousand person tournaments it's a reality check for some of you out there you're gonna have one final table per year that's if you play two tournaments per week wait wait slow down yeah two tournaments per week with a thousand people each you're gonna make one final table per year on average if you're good maybe you make two if you're unlucky zero okay gotta realize that you have to know what you sign up for and um you know that's why you need a big bank roll because you can easily go a year or two or three with no no deep runs and that's going to result in this bankroll just getting dwindled down substantially it's important got to keep a proper bankroll if you don't you're going to lose next don't be too quick to move up a lot of poker players want to get rich quick they want to push the boundaries hard and while there's nothing wrong with pushing the boundaries hard that will result in you potentially developing let's call it degenerate tendencies where you just always want to play bigger and bigger and also that will result in you potentially playing in games where you don't have an edge with a lot of your bankroll at risk what some people do for example go back over here to live cash games down the ground you talk about how i did this as a kid when i interviewed him on my youtube channel youtube.compokercoaching he said he would not recommend this for anyone today but he'd be like yeah if i have 10 buy-ins i'll play whatever game i can with 10 buy-ins if i get up to let's say 15 or 20 i'm moving up if i get down to five i'm moving down so i have 10 again very aggressive bankroll management and you know what happened he went broke most of the time went broke over and over and over and over again i personally don't want to be broke and not have to worry i i don't like having to worry about where i'm going to live what i'm going to eat etc i like to have these things reasonably taken care of and if you don't push the boundaries hard yeah you're not going to get rich quick but you're also not going to get broke either and that's very relevant there's a lot of value in staying in action now back in the day i think loans and staking was substantially more common because everybody was being a degenerate back in the day nobody knew to keep a big bankroll but in today's world if you do go broke it's kind of hard to get back in action i think unless you have like really good connections or you've very clearly proven yourself to be a very very good winner so look don't be in a rush i took it really slow probably a little bit too slow um but i was i've literally never been at risk of going broke right sometimes you have to dip into your i guess reserve fund call it whatever you want wear like blocked up money but literally never gone broke but nowhere near going broke and that will result in me not moving up quite as quick as some people but also results in me literally never going broke and i think there's a lot of value to that especially if you know you're going to be in this for a long time and you know you kind of want to sleep easy at night just because other people gamble and sometimes when huge does not mean that that is the ideal strategy for long-term success so many people watch these poker players playing loose aggressive splashy battling poker and sometimes they win and they get shown off they get bragged about they get coverage but a lot of other people do the exact same thing and they lose and they get no coverage the media likes to show off the winners in the poker space and it doesn't really highlight the losers and it turns out a lot of the losers are people who are really pushing the boundaries um a lot of people well a lot of people every once in a while someone will run hot and let's say the hundred dollar buying tournaments and they go from having let's say ten thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars like overnight right then you know what they do instead of being adequately skilled for the next buying level they they just decide to move up to thousand dollar games because hey they got 100 buy-ins why not and sometimes they run hot there too it is possible for someone to run hot every year look at who the player of the year is that person ran hot i was player of the year one year and i ran ungodly hot i probably won i don't know two thirds of my coin flips and uh you win two-thirds of your flips and high-stakes tournaments you're gonna win a bunch of money i've also had other years that would have been horrible did i all of a sudden get really bad at poker no just didn't win my flips remember when justin bonimo was on his insane run where he won like the one drop and a bunch of other stuff and they interviewed him they said like what's changed over the last two years to let you crush the tournament so hard he's like nothing's changed it's just running hot it's true he realizes this right he's just he came from the sit-and-go space like me and he realizes that there's a ton of variants in poker but he put in a lot of volume in games he can be sometimes it works out right once it's clear that you are winning which requires a bit of time a bit of a sample size right once it's clear you're winning then move up don't be scared of moving up some other people have the problem that's the opposite of degeneracy where they just want to lock up the free win and that's fine and good but you're never going to become a really great poker player by staying well within your comfort zone you do have to push the boundaries a little bit i'm not saying do it the negroni style where you're constantly trying to move up but at the same time there you should be trying to move up because whenever you move up you basically double your income or 1.5x your income whatever it is and that's quite powerful it turns out if you can double your income over and over you're going to start making a bunch of money right and to be fair like even today where i realize poker is much tougher than it was back in the day you can still make a hundred dollars per hour from poker pretty reasonably if you get very good you game select well you play in good times and you know you put in a lot of volume and 100 bucks an hour is a lot of money if you grind hard if your only goal is to win money you play 70 hours a month or sorry 70 hours a week six let's say let's play say 60 hours a week what is that 240 hours per month that's 24 000 per month it's a lot of money what is that 300 000 per year roughly call it 250 if you want to take some time off or play less 250k a year being you know very good at something like 510 no limit it's a lot of a lot of money a lot a lot of money like i don't know why you would want to just be comfortable comfortable playing one two making let's say 50k a year when it's not even much of a gamble at all to try to move up to potentially make 300k per year 250k per year because whenever you try to move up if it goes poorly just move back down yeah you lose a little bit of money but you get some experience at the higher six games then you move back down to your one two game continue making your 50k a year like that should be the fail case not the goal right now once you get to 510 as you start going higher and higher the games do get substantially tougher and that's when like game selection and networking becomes highly valuable or if you're playing tournaments that's where you like really have to be playing like traveling a lot which i realize a lot of people don't want to do um like for most people living in a place where they have 510 no limit you can make that 250k or for two five mm can make 125k per year it's good money all right um make sure you're properly or close to properly bankroll for larger games whenever you go to move up let's say you know you want to keep 30 buy-ins if there is a game where you have 50 buy-ins let's set i'm sorry if there's a game where you have like 25 buy-ins so that means you have 50 buyers of your current level 25 the next high level the double up level um it's probably fine to take a shot there you lose two or three buy-ins move back down you have to be disciplined for taking shots though um you should definitely be taking shots in overly soft games that are about two times your normal game so if you normally play two-five and there's a 510 game that's clearly soft because everybody's having a party and they're clearly super loose gambling players there and there's not very many good players there should probably take a shot i mean imagine let's say you do have fifteen thousand dollars playing two five thirty buy-ins and you're a good player i would immediately ask why do you only have 15k if you're a good player either if you have not put in much time or maybe you're not as good as you think you are make sure you keep good records obviously i didn't say that but that's obvious to me keep diligent records of how you're winning and losing but say they're saying you have 15k 50 buy 15 buy-ins for 510 and there's a game going off insanely in that scenario you should probably take a shot and go give yourself a two by end shot there at that soft game if you lose two thousand bucks go back to your regular game yeah you have to grind out 40 hours to win it back but such is life it is a good gambling spot and that's like kind of an extreme gambling shot right usually if you're playing two five and you're just like a good solid winner then you can like you'll have more than 15k on 75k or something just sitting there waiting for this good game to run in which case you lose 5000 bucks there it's not a big deal right a great example of this was me playing at bellagio like i said i would play 5 10 or 10 20 every day i did this for like a year and change and i had a big bankroll had i don't know a million bucks playing this 510 game that i needed uh what thirty thousand dollars is that right yeah i needed thirty thousand dollars but i'm sitting there with a million dollars okay well bankrolled 1020 we need uh let's say a hundred thousand for 10 20. we have a million right i would sit there and play those games and then every once in a while a bigger game would run that was abnormally soft there's often a 2550 game they're running by the way i did not play it very often at all despite being properly bankrolled for it why because it was often tough it was like the best players plus one bad player playing 25.50 whereas the 510 game was all bad players and like two good players so i could play in this super duper soft 510 game or a really tough 25 50 game you don't need to do it right just because you are properly bankroll for a game does not mean it is the proper play so definitely keep that in mind um anyway anyway every once in a while bigger states games would run and if they're soft i would play do we consider it buying 100 blinds yeah that's what we're considering it but i mean again it's roughly 100 blinds um for cash games so every once in a while a bigger game would run 25 50. i remember one time i played uh 200 400 no limit it was me andrew rommel this other guy named pat and these two very clearly recreational players who came in and wanted to gamble i saw andrew roble and pat playing and i'm like well i guess i'm in the game because these two guys clearly don't know what they're doing andrew and pat think it's a good game and so i sat down we played five-handed for like two hours i stacked one of them one i think i actually won 80k in like two hours and the game ended and that was it right and that kind of opportunity comes up every once in a while where i i don't know how much of a bankroll i need for 200 400 but a million bucks is probably not it you probably need more right but the game was soft thought it was a good spot sometimes you win sometimes you lose it turns out in cash games i've been very lucky taking these shots where i'm essentially just table selecting game selecting really really hard and playing in the games when they're normally soft so say you normally do play two five no limit at your casino or even one three at your casino and for some reason somebody wants to stumble in late at night to play five ten no limit and it's you and them and maybe another rad player and another good player that's a good spot to take a shot if you if you know you're like a definitive winner in the 1-3 game because if you win you increase your bankroll substantially if you lose yeah you lose some money but you know you can go back down and grind it back up often as well whenever you take a shot your downside is very capped right like if i lost i think i was probably going to lose like 100k in the 200 400 games so 250 big blinds if i lost that yeah it sucks but that's like the most i can lose right there's a chance though i could win a ton now it turns out both these guys showed up they lost whatever 60 80k each and then they left but there's a chance they just go off right if they're gonna go off and just play all night and lose 500k each that's a pretty good spot for you to be in right so usually if you're smart with shot taking your well if you are shot taking intelligently your downside risk is very capped whereas the upside risk is relatively uncapped also that'll give you a bigger bankroll potentially allow you to play bigger games um next typically you do not want to take gigantic shots now i know i just talked about this going from 10 20 to 200 400 that's an anomaly but say you are a tournament player you don't want to take shots where you normally play let's say 100 buying tournaments and then you move to a 3 500 buying tournament that's the main event at your casino or whatever a lot of poker players really mess this up what they do every year is they grind it out in their local games playing hundred dollar buying tournaments or whatnot they win 15 20 30 000 every year like clockwork playing in soft games soft small field games then they take that 20 or 30k to the world series of poker and play like five 1500 buying tournaments and then they're usually going to lose right and so they go there and they lose 7 500 bucks out of their 10 20 30k they win and it's just like completely unnecessary they're trying to they're basically grinding it out all year to take a shot in super high variance games and it just doesn't really make a lot of logical sense wouldn't you rather just play your 100 buying games for five years make 150k 120k whatever remember as your bankroll gets bigger you can play 200 games and 300 games in your local casino so you're you're gonna be able to grind it up exponentially to some extent and then after five years you have 150k and you're like starting to get reasonably bankrolled for these 500 thousand dollar buying big field tournaments right that way you're not taking a shot where you go back home losing half your money or all of your money um someone i know on a regular basis he would win 10 000 per year go to the world series lose all of it sometimes he'd run hot every time he ran hot he'd buy a car or something like you know torches run hot money didn't save it and that's gonna result in just like never having money despite being pretty good at poker because if you can win ten thousand dollars playing hundred dollar tournaments every year it's like pretty good right but you just always end up broke because you spend the money you win whenever you do run hot in the big games and usually you lose in the big games right be quick to move back down i know put this here at the bottom of the slide but uh this is very important be quick to move back down go back to the previous slide don't be in a rush poker is a great way to get rich slowly do not have ego problems this is important very important many decent players go broke because they refuse to accept reality whatever reality actually is look at your situation observe it intelligently and realize the spot that you are in maybe you're in a great spot maybe you're in a bad spot ask yourself for example tournament players out there who win a thousand buy-ins or 100 buy-ins in a tournament ask yourself am i actually adequately skilled to play games five times the size just because my bankroll indicates it with me when i used to play five ten no limit that need i needed a thirty thousand dollar bankroll for when i'm saying there was a million dollars was i adequately skilled to beat the 2550 game maybe but like why there's no point because i know your win writing that game's just never going to be that big right but my butt was in a chair waiting for the super soft big games to run right that you know maybe i'm not even probably bankroll for but we'll take a shot so you a lot of people think they are better than they are they don't keep good results they don't keep good records of their results they um they just don't observe reality properly and this it's a hard thing to do if you have poker playing friends who you can ask their opinion and you respect their opinion ask their opinion get out get input from other people who you respect now make sure you respect good people ask like poker coaching coaches if you ask any poker coach and coach here questions about your skill level compared to the opponents or whatnot they're gonna be able to give you a reasonably good answer like probably a very good answer right and i've told many students look you're not skilled enough to beat these games some care some don't those who don't usually don't win i mean i can give my opinion but if you know you're welcome to not take it so ideally you whenever you're like you want to make sure you understand what's actually happening and if you understand what's actually happening then there will be no surprises whenever things inevitably go poorly or they go well or whatever right a lot of people a lot of people more than you would think or maybe not more than you think i don't know a lot of people think that once they move up that they are a failure at life if they have to move back down because things go poorly what happens to some people is they play two five no limit grind it up get a 50k bankroll move up to 510 they're being responsible they move to 510 with 50 buy-ins they play they lose they lose they lose they lose down to 30k they lose down to 20k and then they're like huh i have 20k i'm not properly bankroll for this game anymore what do i do well the answer is not keep playing it the answer is move down and grind up your bankroll to give yourself essentially another good opportunity at the 510 game if you even feel inclined to try to move to it maybe you are in the same spot i was in where your 5-10 game was super soft or sorry super tough but the 2-5 game is super soft if that's the case then you maybe don't need to play that 5 10 game the way it essentially works is imagine you're playing a higher stakes game but your win rate is halved you'd rather play the smaller game because there's way less variance right and that's kind of what i was dealing with at bellagio i knew i went about a hundred bucks an hour at 5 10. i also knew i could win about 110 per hour at 10 20. a little bit more but a lot more variance at least over the sample that i had and i had a pretty good sample at 25.50 i didn't know what i could reasonably win because i did not put in a lot of time there but i can look around the table and see everybody's good besides one player who's not even that bad right so i know that there is not going to be much of an edge there so i know that game's not going to be all that profitable because the losing player there is losing let's say 500 per hour divided by nine or eight other good players 500 divided by eight is what 40 bucks per hour not a good win rate it's not like i'm going to be that much better than any of the other good players there so whatever like you make 100 bucks per hour at most so i'd rather make 100 bucks per hour playing 510 with no risk 110 per hour playing 1020 with like some risk and certainly more swings or 25.50 where who knows what i'd win but it would certainly be about 100 bucks per hour right it makes a lot of sense to just play the 510 game because it's free right and your local casino is maybe like one two five is free and five ten is tough i don't know you gotta get in there figure it out this is where students come to me and give me very very clear pictures of what's happening and i can give the best advice i possibly can anyway though say you do play the 5-10 game and you think you're supposed to be winning here but you just keep losing and you don't really know why hire a coach immediately to figure out why but also move back down also once you do start beating the game this happened to me to some extent a long time ago i kind of stopped studying right why because i'd rather sit there and grind out my money but you need to continuously study you really do a lot of um very good poker players i mean kind of kind of roughly my age had good success when they were young they were studying a lot devoting all their time to poker then as they get older they start making even more money because you know they have a bigger bankroll to continue playing bigger but they just want to grind it out and make the money and then they stop studying and then next thing you know they lose their edge right some other poker players assume that if they're good at poker that they must be good at all other aspects of life a great example of this recently has been cryptocurrencies right so many poker players so many poker players think that because they're good at poker they must be good at other things that most people have no clue about right cryptocurrencies are relatively new so almost no one's an expert and if you're spending all your time at the poker table you're definitely not an expert right because you're not devoting any time to it or devoting minimal amounts of time to it this is a very good example of like people who just think that if they are studying some are more than their peers that they must be good but especially in things like the investing world you are literally playing in some of the most sophisticated people in the world who have technologies you are completely unaware of and they're going to crush you so don't be egotistical and think that just because you are good at poker that you must be good at other things realize the amount of skill it takes to get good at poker the amount of dedication it gets good to poker and realize the amount of effort you've put into that it's probably a lot right every other thing in the world takes about that much effort to become very very good at and to be able to make a substantial amount of income from it and if you like realize that you're not doing that then i hate to break it do you're going to be a loser or just like kind of breaking even now the nice thing about some things like investing is that some things inevitably just kind of go up like stock market just kind of goes up over time because you're investing in companies that produce value right obviously there are gonna be big swings in that too but if you invest in companies especially big companies that have been around for a while they produce value and you're not going to get rich investing in these things but you're going to grow a little bit and i mean i don't know we're not getting to investment advice here but you know what i'm saying right don't presume that just because you're good at poker that you're good at other stuff again all you have to do to win is find a game you can beat play it a lot and keep a proper bankroll this here gives you a positive win rate this here decreases variance and this here ensure ensures you are never gonna go broke doesn't actually decrease variance but you get through the variance right fans will still be there you're still gonna have big wins you're still gonna have big losses in terms of upswings and downswings but you know you'll get through them okay so that's it that's my talk on how to make the most of a small bankroll if you have literally oh well i guess i should say this if you have like literally no or almost no money like me when i started 50 online poker is amazing because you can play literally one cent two cent right make sure you can beat the rank but play small play tiny there's nothing wrong with playing tiny especially if you do not already know if you're a good strong winning player and if you have a small or non-existent bankroll it kind of implies you're not all that good at poker or you just haven't played all that much if you're new to anything don't try to just jump in the high stakes and get rich quick because you're not skilled right and poker is a game that can be immensely rewarding but it can also be incredibly detrimental if you are just taking all your money every week and gambling with it right so the fact that you have a tiny bankroll is kind of irrelevant because you can always split even a 50 bankroll into 100 50 cent chunks right or 50 dollar chunks and grind it up i already showed you you can double your bankroll roughly every two months months if you just put in decent volume not even decent volume like a little bit of volume and uh you know don't be in a rush so many people are in a rush to get rich quick if you don't have 50 you should probably get a job i hate to break it to you you got to have a little bit of money to make decent money at poker and um even if you get like a minimum wage job you know like that that will hopefully pay your bills and give you a little bit of disposable income maybe not a minimum wage job depends on where you live but um you know what i'm saying right like if you're making if you have like literally no money you probably need to get a job and to just to survive right the great thing about most jobs by the way is that they only take 40 hours per week that gives you a lot of other time to do other stuff like get another job if necessary i used to have two jobs when i went to college and that's because i wanted to have some money and i liked both my jobs right and i didn't mind it didn't want to do for forever but i also didn't mind and i realized i need to pay my bills so you need you need a healthy dose of reality is what it amounts to and understand the situation you're in and then figure out where to go from there", metadata={'source': 'ouY_3qEWeU8', 'title': 'How

[Document(page_content="let's go ahead and talk about the pros of playing poker at the casino we're gonna compare it to firstly online play and then we're gonna compare it to private games so first comparing casino poker to online play definitely there's the social experience um being someone who grinds a lot of online poker grinds a lot of online games um i know that it's very beneficial to get out there and spend some time with other people so it's super fun to get the social experience you can be out there to make your money while you're playing or you can actually just go out and have some fun and typically uh at a casino you know especially on the weekends people are often in the mood to have a good time so it's it's a nice environment to be in if your primary skill set is related to poker it's related to games which relate to strategy this is going to be an environment that you're probably going to feel pretty comfortable in and therefore you know you'll be able to be more comfortable more at ease more relaxed and and really be able to enjoy yourself and express yourself which i think is really important in life so next the visceral experience i find you know i'm a kid who played with lego a grown kid now i always like to build stuff and there's something really satisfying about building up towers of chips you know it's it's a type of satisfaction that you don't get online yes it's nice to run up your stacks online and see the numbers on the screen go up but there's something really satisfying about just building a pile in front of you so i thoroughly enjoy the visceral experience of you know building towers you know cash games or tournaments so i'm a big fan of that part next one definitely softer competition it is without a doubt uh easier to outplay your opponents easier to make better decisions in live poker and overall easier to win due to the softer competition that is available in live play obviously this is offset a little bit with the fact that we can't uh play as many tables as we could online but um you know it's it's good to be able to just apply your skill set really feel the confidence and know that you know your spots and the thing about live poker you get the time to think them through too speaking of thinking things through and getting the edge you also get more information and with the more information that you get from tells general mannerisms things you can gather from conversation because people are a bit more communicative live than they are online it's easier to get that information profile your opponent and play better as a result with a good idea of their strategy and understanding of the game finally we have the vip rewards which depending on where you are some of them are decent some of them are not so good but it's nice to be able to get rewards and this is something if you're going to a town like las vegas or atlantic city or somewhere where there are a lot of casinos it may be worth shopping around to find out what the rewards programs are because you may be able to get some comps that will make your trip much more cost effective are there any other advantages you can think of to playing casino poker uh versus online play it's time to feel free to throw them in the chat just want to see if there's anything that i missed because obviously i'd love to ensure that we uh we cover all the pros of playing casino poker right robert's on point so i'm gonna cook for you you can get the casino food and if you're at the right establishment sometimes it's gonna be quite nice right brandon you know the visualization the scooping the pot the sound when they push the chips your way so it's a lot of the the visceral stuff and the sensual stuff and the the really ex experiential stuff that we get you know so so for me that was kind of it practice online and then go play live and it's nice to be able to have an edge where you're expecting to make money most of the time win more often than you lose session wise and with larger amounts then you lose session by session and that you kind of get to free roll a fun night out where you get to go play cards hang out likely make some money and you know get to be out there with the lights music the sounds of the peoples and the food and all that so glad that you know y'all are into it too so now let's compare casino poker versus private games so both of these are in the live poker setting and the biggest difference here is the safety in a casino you know there's security you know there are cameras uh you know you're gonna get paid out it's cashing cash out and you're just much more protected obviously there's a little risk you hear your stories here and there but the the risk profile of uh casino poker versus private games is probably something like 99 to one so it's definitely a lot safer to play at the casino um again the security that you're guaranteed to get paid out because that's an issue in private games which we'll talk about in december next is choice typically the casino has many more tables that you're going to find in a private game a private game usually has one or two tables unless it's a very high-end club maybe you'll get four casinos you can have tens sometimes even hundreds of tables you know if you're playing uh at the rio during the world series poker so the fact that there are so many games and so many limits to choose from is a huge perk to playing a casino poker and we'll talk about how to capitalize on that later in the presentation finally uh service which is exactly what uh robert was talking about depending on the venue you can have you know good service and really good menus to choose from and all that um arguable some private games have that as well but at many casinos you're kind of guaranteed to get it so any other advantages you can think of for casino games versus private games and while you guys are um posting that in the chat i'll just share a story about my first time playing live poker at casino um so i was in college at the time and i'd been studying poker and i was really excited to go play live poker i've been i've been playing home games at school and doing okay i've been playing online and doing well and i was ready you know i was ready to go play live poker and i was gonna school these casino fools and i was gonna take care of business so a friend of mine we organized it he came to pick me up we drove down it was maybe an hour hour 15 away from where we were attending school and i was reviewing my mike caro's book of tells because i was going to get all my tells all my reads on everyone i was just going to god mode it right so we show up at the casino and uh we say we'd like to play poker they say cool you can put your name on the wait list we're like wait list they're like yeah those are there's the list uh we'll put you on there your name will be and i'm looking at the list but i can't even see the bottom of it they're like yeah well that's why you know you should have called ahead and you know you wouldn't have to wait for as long but these are the tables we have these are the waitlists so you're gonna have to just go ahead and wait i'm like okay so i put my name on two fives it was the smallest game in the room go read my uh cairo's book tells and maybe sklansky's advanced nolan holden theory and practice for however long the wait is probably 45 minutes to an hour finally get called get on the game find out it's not even no limit it's two five fixed limit nothing that i'd learned mattered it was basically a bingo game which you know i got into the spirit of it but it was not what i expected at all because i didn't do my due diligence i didn't do my preparation and um that's why one of the many things we're going to go through in this presentation is how to do your preparation so that you don't end up in that same spot where you're waiting a long time playing the wrong game and just being really inefficient with your poker experience okay so first let's talk about maximizing ev by picking the right venue in time and this is where many people will already be familiar with this but if you're not the bravo poker app is your best friend if you already have it on your phone fantastic if you're not go to your apple store or your google play store or android store whatever you have and download the bravo poker app download it install it check it out thank me later this app is incredible it will show you all the card rooms in the world basically and it will group them by which ones are the closest to you and then you can scroll out on the map to see get farther and farther and farther away in addition to listing all the casinos that are close to you that spread poker um and exactly how far they are it also includes the games that they spread as well as special promotions so if you tap on a casino and drill down it will tell you what tables they run it will tell you what special promotions they have like maybe a battery jackpot or tournaments or daily tournaments and it'll probably have a contact number as well so you can get all your information and know that they actually spread the game that you want to play at the casino that's there because maybe the closest one to you only has limit and you want to play no limit or they only have no limit and you want to play pot limit omaha so this app fantastic and it's totally free so once you got the bravo app the next thing you want to do is call ahead and get informed the best way to get information is to acquire the information from those who know best and whose job it is to inform you to get in so i didn't do that you know early on and i used to not call because i didn't really want to talk to people i was more of a typing kind of computer guy but that was my mistake because if you call in and you're nice with the floor people you're cordial with the floor people you ask reasonable questions you don't ask too many questions they're going to give you all the answers you need from what games do you have when do the big games run when do the juiciest games run when do you tend to have the most traffic what time does the casino shut down at night how long do you keep my spot on the wait list if i call in can i call in for a wait list all these kind of things you call in you get the information and they'll tell you because it's their job to bring you in any special promotions you guys have coming up they're going to tell you any rewards for the players that they have they're going to tell you and the more information you have the more effectively you can make the right decision as to the best place to play poker for you the best place to invest your time and energy um speaking of that added value you know ask them if they have you know bad b jackpots um or or tournament series and you know this is kind of what you see if you drill down into the bravo poke graph if there's a big bad beat jackpot you're going to get a lot more people at the card room because everyone's trying to hit it but the games are probably going to be a little nittier because everyone's just trying to run the boards and see if they can hit the bad beat jackpot on the other hand if you go and there's a tournament series going on you're going to have a lot more players who are tournament players but who aren't cash game players who are more recreational than the typical cash game players because they go for the excitement of a tournament and a lot of them will go play cash after they bust the tournament probably not be in the right mindset for cash probably be a little stuck little chasing a little trying to get even so if you're a cash game player cash game specialist and you can find out when attorney series is going on and post up at the cash tables you are going to for sure make more money because you're going to be in softer games and then um yeah i guess i already discussed that that there's massive value during the tournament series so find out when they're when they're running find out when they're coming up and the floor people will tell you everything they're so excited to tell you about their big promotion their big yearly tournament all the satellites that are running to it and if you can plan your trips around when they're running their events whether it's the satellites whether it's a bad beat jackpot whether it's some other kind of promo you're just gonna get in better games and you're gonna make more money because those promotions are gonna draw people in who aren't as serious of players but they're there for the fun and the thrill and as we know that's where you're to make the most money in the card games all right so that was about what was that topic that was picking the right venue in time now we're going to look at how to save time and make money these are mostly just practical things but things i've learned over the years that save me a ton of time and get me in a way better spots and greatly increase my hourly rate when i go play cards so first thing to do is know your travel time great thing is bravo app will tell you where the casino is boom you punch that into a map quest or whatever gps app you have on your phone it'll tell you what the distance to the casino is and if you called ahead and you know how long your seat is held for well let's say they hold your seat for 60 minutes you have a 90 minute drive you can go ahead and call when you're 40 minutes into your drive 50 minutes away from the casino and know that you're going to get close to the maximum of that 60 minute wait time now you don't want to time it where it's exactly 60 because if you run into traffic you're not going to make it on time and usually if you show up too late your name is going to be off the list but if you show up early before your name's there but your name is at the top you're welcome to go on the table you know you don't have to wait till it's exactly your max time your name is just moving up the list and the more time your name is on the wait list the farther up the list your name is going to be by the time you get there so ideally you want to set it where you have about a 10 to 15 minute forgiveness window but otherwise call in the maximum time ahead so that you have as much time as possible for your name to move up the list while you're driving there you know so you're making the waitlist work for you well you have to do travel time anyway um so for that you want to call ahead and you need to know how long they'll hold your spot this is where your research from before can work or just when you call them you can say hey how long do you hold my seat for and if they say you know 90 minutes but you're two hours away don't know why you'd really play a casino that's two hours away but just for the case of example it's fine you'd say okay i'll call you back in about half an hour you wouldn't put your name on the list then because it's an extra thing they'd have to do and they have to move you you say okay i'll call back in half an hour so you call ahead next thing to do when you put your name on the list put your name on multiple lists because the same way we were speaking about how the the more time you call in ahead the more time your name is working up the list well if you're on multiple list you're working your way up multiple lists at the same time and whichever list is shorter is the one you're more likely to to get to the top of first now if you're someone who enjoys playing two five no limit hold them and the 510 game is quite big maybe don't put your name on that list but put your name on two five and one three if you're a one three player but you know you could handle a two five if you just buy in shorter than the max you know buying for 300.25 put your name on both of the lists you never know if the two five games might be fantastic and the one three games are not so hot but by putting your name on both lists you get the choice and you have two lists working for you rather than one now i wouldn't put my name on a plo list because i don't really play plo but just that idea of having your name working out multiple lists is very helpful now i did think that there was a perk to being on a table and then requesting a table change like you were going to get priority and this is worth finding out what the policy is but for most casinos that i've played at the table change priority which you know you'd be at the top of the let's say you're on table 701 your top of the 1-3 list when you want to move to another table you get to move before someone else gets put on a game but it only applies to the limit you're playing so if you go five and instantly request a table change to one three you're not going to get top priority there but you would if you're staying on two five so that's why putting your name on games that on the list for nate games you're willing to play makes sense but for games that are for sure out of your bankroll or out of your comfort zone doesn't make a whole lot of sense the next thing you want to do is check in on arrival because you don't want to get bumped typically your your seat is held for the amount of time they tell you but as soon as you check in now your seat is is good right so if they hold it for 60 minutes and you show up 62 minutes or you show up 40 minutes ahead right you have 20 minutes of wait time if you don't confirm that you're there they won't even call your name as soon as your 60 minutes is up your name just disappears so make sure you check in as soon as you get there so your name goes from being a call-in to someone who's here and on the wait list and then they'll actually call you i've had the experience of missing my seat fortunately i knew the floor person so i was able to get back on the list but you don't want to risk it you don't want to risk it so check it out arrival don't get bumped um because the weight can be very long and then finally know the floor manager or the director if you know the floor manager of the poker room director when little things like that happen where you forget to check in they'll check you in um you know they might even put you higher up on the list they i mean in some rooms they might even just say uh oh don't worry about there's a seat just go take the seat go take the seat we'll get some from the list later um there are many things that can work in your favor when people like you and when the people who are in who are running the show like you you have a much better chance of good things happening but you have a much better chance of good fortune coming your way so tips are not required but they're certainly appreciated not all casinos will allow people to tip the floor staff but if you can i highly encourage it if you can't tip the floor staff with money you can still tip them with a compliment you can still tip them by being polite you can maybe if you're playing at a place very frequently maybe you can find out what the floor person's into maybe like sports maybe you buy them a ticket for a game or something sometime there are many ways you can work around just straight giving them money but the better your relationship is with the floor manager or the director the better your experience is going to be at the casino every time you go play guaranteed so if you have one spot you frequent very frequently go ahead and try to make friends with as many as the floor people staff dealers directors everyone as possible you'll get perks you'll get rulings in your favor and also you'll just feel more comfortable more welcome and you'll be more excited to go to the casino because there will be people there who are looking forward to see you and it's always more fun to go to a party when people are excited to see you than a party where no one knows who you are um yeah okay so that's that's that's how to save time and money and just it's it's from personal experience uh i've i've wasted so much time by not knowing about calling ahead by forgetting to check in when i got there by not doing the multiple listing and then as soon as i kind of added all these tricks oh my god i've i've never had to wait more than like 10 minutes to get on a table and i usually get in a really good game so speaking of good games you want to start your session off right and often there will be some waiting time um there there will be some waiting time so the best thing to do while you're waiting is to watch while you wait i used to sit at the rail when i would get to falls view casino and watch the tables that i could that were close to the rail probably half of them were near the rail half of the morning and what i was looking for when i was watching was trying to find the best table in the room uh you're i'd be looking for drinking i'd be looking for laughter i'd be looking for cash on the table i'd be looking for sloppy chips i'd just be looking for crazy action people who look like they're having a party i wouldn't just look at where the big stacks were or tables that had a lot of chips and play but who are they in front of if the big stacks are in front of a bunch of regulars well the game might already be you know running down but if the big stacks are in front of players you've never seen before or players who look wasted or players who look exhausted like they haven't slept for two days that's probably a really good game right and if you know what the best table in the room is then as soon as you get on a table you can request a table change to that specific table right we'll talk a little bit about table changes at the end of the slide but it's good to think about and since you're going to invest time acquiring information later that's what you do once you're sitting at the table between hands anyway why not invest that same time before you sit down at the table and save yourself the time so you can go straight to practice straight to execution as soon as you get in the game it's the same as putting your name on the waitlist while you're driving there and making most of the time while you're just driving you're going to be waiting anyway why not make the most of that time so that once you get in the game you can get straight to action same as you put your name on the waitlist so when you get to the casino you can get straight to play next up take the seat you're given time on table increases expectation as long as you didn't put your name down for like a 10 20 less when you're a one three primary when you play one three primarily whatever seat you're given you're going to have a positive expected value by being on that table and you're better off being on a table than waiting for the best table so always take the seat you're given you can immediately start getting hands you can start making decisions start making money but also once you're on a table you can put your name on the table change list to get on a better table and you stay at the top of the list if you don't take the seat you're given sometimes you will be bumped down to the list again so just just take it next up once you get your seat take it seriously um i remember when i was going to the casino i would play you know 2-5-5-10 my main game was 5 10 but i played 2-5 while i was waiting and occasionally i'd play 10 20. and i remember being in a 2-5 game waiting for actually i think back then they even had one two so i think i was in a one-two game while we were waiting for the 5-10 game to get going and there was a 510 player who bought in with a purple 500 chip which you don't see at one two tables and he was just punting so hard and i'm like dude what's the deal and he's like oh this game's boring man i'm waiting for the big game to start like i don't even care about this but you know once you punt off two three four of those 500 chips you're stuck and then when he gets to 510 he's already chasing so even if it may not be as exciting to play the smaller game it's really good practice to just make great decisions to practice good habits and then you'll be in the right state of mind when you get to the bigger game now probably this player was just an action player who was going to play cards for the rush for the excitement and so you know he wasn't thinking about the game the same way i was but even if i'm going to play 510 if the first seat i get is the one two seat i'm gonna take it and you know get into my poker zone get comfortable i'm gonna take it seriously because what i'm prac what i'm there for is not i'm not thinking about how can i make the most money as quickly as possible thinking about what's going to lead to me making the best decisions because that's what's going to lead to making the most money and the way to make the best decisions at the bigger game is to start making the best decisions as soon as you sit down or even before you get to the casino because that means you're in the right mindset to make the best decisions now once you're on that table and you've taken the seat that you're given if you aren't on the best game which you will hopefully have identified before you even sat down request a table change and be specific on the table you want if you know what the best game is or the best two or three games in the room say i would like a table change two table five six and nine right and when one of those comes up you'll get on that table or if they're all kind of marginal except for table you say i would like a table change table 11. if c comes up i'll go on table 11. otherwise it'll stay here that's fine if you don't know what the best table is but you know that your table is no good you say table change to any and as soon as the seat opens up on another table they'll move you to another seat um yeah so the more you know the more specific you can be and you can get to that table where the greener pastures are but if you don't know which tables are better you just know that your table's no good just request a table change to any and start moving around the poker room until you figure out where the best game's at and this is where knowing the floor person or having a team of friends at the casino really helps because they'll tell you the floor person's like hey this guy's really going off tonight you might want to go get in that game i know you're not a plo player but i think it's worth it going for plo night because they know this stuff and you know if you're taking care of them they're going to take care of you too so take your first seat take the one you're given take it seriously but as soon as you can try to get to the greenest pastures in the room because you will have identified them while you were waiting all right my apologies i don't have animations for the pictures on the next two slides so let's talk about maximizing ev positioning yourself to profit so you already know how to get on the best table look for the table that's basically a party or look for the table where you see a bunch of bigger stacks in front of players who don't look like they're at their sharpest right or players you don't recognize you just look like they have no business having a stack like that or playing in a game like that so the next thing you want to do is get in the best seat and jonathan speaks about this i speak about this i have to imagine every poker coach out there speaks about this money flows clockwise around the poker table that's just the structure of the game because of position money flows clockwise around the poker table so try to get to the left of your targets once you've identified the best table you probably identified the best spots to target for the weakest players or the most tilted players most out of their comfort zone players whatever and you want to try to get to the left of them so first things first get on the table next things next try to get a seat on the left of the people who you are targeting who the game is built around now on that note when it comes to buying in the old thinking was you want to buy in to cover everyone if you're the best player on the table you want to be playing with the deepest stack now the more we studied poker the more we learned about poker that's not always true because again chips tend to flow to the left there's a positional advantage and the deeper the stacks are the more amplified that positional advantage is so if the only players to your left are good players and they're deep stacked and everyone else is shallow you don't want to buy in deep then you're just playing at a disadvantage against the players who are deep stacked and you have no additional advantage over the players who are shorter stacked where the players are targeting so the the main strategy knowing that money flows to the left is to buy in deeper than those on your right but to be wary of those on your left who are deep stacked you don't need to buy in for the max always again that old adage that if you're the best player you want to buy in for the most not fully applicable and given how many good players are not buying in super deep to play deep stack out of position versus a solid player it's just it's just not giving you an edge so once you get to the table scan the table and pick your buy-in based on that remember you can always add more chips up to the table maximum but you aren't allowed to take chips off the table so it's better to buy in for less than the max and quickly top up if you realize having the max is the way to go rather than buying in for the max right away and then potentially being stuck in a situation where you didn't want to buy in for the table max because it wasn't the best uh the best ev play so next um i mean this kind of goes to in the same vein as getting the best seat changing seats if you're at a casino where there's a seat change button as they have a casino niagara ask for the seat change button if they're at a casino where they don't have a seat change button just know when a seat opens up first come first serve first request gets it be quick to say hey i i i like to take that seat you know if the player is driving i'll be like are you are you finishing the session no okay yeah oh one more orbit yeah okay dealer i'd like his seat when he's done now the the players who you're you're targeting may be aware of this sometimes you'll move they'll move but it's it's better to go for it than to not go for it if you have the chance to get a more lucrative seat uh a better value seat um than than to not try so yeah that being said you're if if you already have the bestie on the table that's it the other thing if you're close to the best seat on the table but not literally the best seat maybe you don't want to draw attention to your mark your target the person the game is built around or maybe you don't want to ask for the seat change button as soon as you sit down because it is going to affect your table image is going to affect you know clearly how much you know about the game how much for regular you are and sometimes you don't want to draw attention to that so when you get to the table kind of rank the seats at the table one through nine and if you're in a top three seat maybe you don't need to get the seat change button right away or ask for a seat change right away but if you're in the lower half then definitely go for the upgrade whenever you can and you know you'll you'll you're you'll use your poker sense in your two intuitive sense to decide when it makes sense to go for a seat change versus when it makes sense to just uh maintain a low profile image finally topping up uh something i've always been a big fan of i buy in you know when i buy in for 100 blinds i'd always top up to 100 blinds i lose a pre-flop race top up to 100 blinds three bet failed top up ten more blinds uh open a pot c bet lose on the turn top up um because i to have as many chips as i'm allowed to have that give me the optimal stack size and as i mentioned before you can always add more chips table you can't take them off so yeah better buy and shorter topic when you get better c yeah cool so that is how to position yourself to profit i hope all of that makes sense it's all this is just about putting yourself in a position where you're gonna make more money um by playing the same poker you would if you were in a different seat but because you're in a better seat you're just going to make more money because you're in a better game you're just going to make more money you're boosting your hourly by doing the little extra things that other people don't want to do because they're lazy um and you don't even have to play poker any differently once you get in position okay next uh staying in the money which is again all about maximizing eb so be willing to move around be willing to change tables i think the worst thing a player can do and i've seen players do this time and time again they show up they get a seat floor puts them in a seat they stay in the seat for like eight hours just grind they don't look at the other tables to see what's going on they don't put their name on a table change list they don't even ask for a seat change ever the only time they request to see changes so they can see the tv better and they're just missing out on so much value by not putting themselves in the prime spot to profit and yeah it takes a little work sometimes you got to walk around the room to scout the tables you got to go for bathroom breaks anyway again if you have friends you know dealers or whatever you got another excuse you go say what's up to your friends and while you're doing that you're kind of scouting the scene if you're willing to do that i promise you you will make more money you'll you'll you'll get in better games and you'll just have more fun playing poker i guarantee you so second point is that keep an eye and an ear out for better games you're gonna see madness you're gonna hear people being like oh you know big pot or oh my god or cussing or whatever you'll hear it and then you just kind of gotta look over and see what's going on and and and suss it out is it just a bad beat things happen or oh is someone actually playing like a complete maniac and the more attuned you are to the environment the more likely you're gonna be to find the best one two one three two five five ten game whatever it is usually once you go bigger there's only one game at the limit anyway so there's not a lot of choice but in those smaller limits one two one three two five five five uh even five ten they're usually multiple tables and one of them will be way better than the other ones so it's worth figuring out what that table is getting there and then getting the best seat now this is something that i did poorly when i first you know was learning about this i got a little too obsessed with trying to get in the best game so you don't want to play musical chairs all night being in a great game is fine you don't always need to be in the best game the important thing is to make sure you're not sitting in a bad game for any longer than necessary and that you refused play in a terrible game as long as you are in an upper tier game you know a good game a great game an excellent game perfect the important thing is getting out of the games where everyone's a rag everyone's a pro or everyone's a net or there's no action there's no spot once you're on a pretty decent game it can be better than going for you know the quote-unquote perfect game because if you're in a great game and you have reads on the opponents that may be a higher value set up for you than being in the best game in the room where you have no reads yet you're gonna have to take half an hour an hour to to figure everybody out so don't undervalue your game just because people are hooting and hollering at another table and don't undervalue the value of the reads you have and the um table image you have and the dynamic you have with people because that's worth a lot so there we talked about never staying a bad game for any longer than necessary and um tap into the floor in your network as i mentioned earlier in the presentation i'll mention it again and i'll mention in the next presentation knowing the floor helps with this having friends in the room helps a lot with this on the floor helps a little having friends in the room helps a lot your friends will tell you where the best game is your friends will tell you when someone is going off your friends will tell you when you need to get on a game and this is why having a team to play with is extremely valuable when you frequent the card room on a regular basis and that's why next webinar we're going to talk about how to get those friends in your circle so you can grow your circle and as a result grow your chip stacks grow your bankroll and you know grow grow all your poker success and accolades so putting it all together step one is to maximize your hourly with minimal effort by planning a hat um by planning ahead you maximize your hourly or return on time investment with no extra effort once you've done the planning all you need to do is follow through with the plan once you've got on the best table all you need to do is sit in the table sit on the table and play but it's that little bit of planning ahead that goes a long way and it's 100 worth the investment number two the best way to make money is to find the best place time and day to play i i feel like we we didn't actually touch on that and i probably should have mentioned it usually the best day to play is a friday or saturday night because you're gonna have the most people there who are there party who are there to just just blow off steam and gamble and you're not going to have the same grinders that you find on the monday tuesday wednesday so when the tournaments are going on it's going to be great but on a week-to-week basis usually friday and saturday are going to be the best times to play but again if you know the floor you can ask when do you run the most tables when is the card room at its busiest and if you have friends who play they'll tell you when the best games are and you'll quickly find out like when uh when i was playing a lot of falls view back when they had poker there the big game was on thursday night and it was 10 20. and if you showed up by five o'clock or six o'clock you could get in the game and if you didn't show up by five or six you were going to be on the waitlist and you're probably going to never get in because no one who got on that game was going to get out of that game so the move was to go play go up on thursday night play in the big game stay overnight play friday night stay overnight if still feeling it play saturday night if not feeling it's too tired go back home and let's say there's work on friday on friday then the move was to go up on friday play friday night stay overnight saturday night go home and the more you go the more you speak with people the more you'll figure out what the best days are the best times and that knowing when last call is super helpful knowing if the last call never happens people can drink all night pretty helpful all the useful information so number three call ahead to minimize wait time and maximize your table time but don't forget to leave a cushion for traffic unforeseen events the last thing you want to do is really you know get super nitty and try to time it within the minute and then you get bought from the list because you were too slow number four watch while you wait to identify the most profitable positions in the card room because once you've identified what they are you can make the efforts to try to get yourself in those positions and once you're in those positions time to sit back apply your strategy and collect your profits number five know the value of your seats if possible be on the lookout for more valuable seats but don't undervalue your seat truly value your seat um a lot of times your seat's worth more than you think it is and that's all about keeping up with who's who's who's even even keeled steady footed still minded who's tilted who's stuck how many people in your game are losing how many people are winning uh look for games where people are losing look for games where people are stuck look for games where people are frustrated look for games where people are drinking look for games where people are going a lot of smoke breaks because clearly they're they're they're tilted and they're looking to calm down um but don't necessarily put yourself in a game where everyone is flaming out with anger right you got you got to think about the environment you're in but consider those things and the more that's why i say your game may be better than you think it is because if you're winning steadily and a lot of people are losing and they're getting frustrated that's good for you because they're going to be misplaying against you because they're stuck and they want to see they want to get even with you a lot of these emotional players they don't want to see the same person win they want you know someone else to get their turn somebody start going after you as long as they're out of position versus you that's going to be profitable for you finally number six your net worth will increase your poker net worth and that's what we're going to talk about next week with the traits that you want to embody live by uh the traits you want to look for in other people you build your network and specific tactics or techniques you can use to um bring together that uh dream team thank you very much for tuning in thank you for sharing this your evening with me and uh have yourself a great night and uh until next

[Document(page_content="we're going to do today is go through just a few mark 10's and then just talk about all the different game theory concepts that are at play we're going to dive into power solver the goal of this is to look at situation develop strong habits and fundamentals such that you can apply these concepts to a bunch of different board textures a bunch of different situations that you're going to face in game so yeah let's uh let's jump right in firsthand comes from a recent 25k uh actually forced to the button this guy raises he's a strong player we call king three of spades trapped in deuce rainbow chuck about 25 pot and that leads us to our first decision point so i think this is a really good hand to show uh how to construct check raise ranges um especially when we're facing a button open because they're gonna have a really wide range they're gonna be betting with a really wide range of bands in these situations come up all the time and anytime you're dealing with really wide ranges it's it's really difficult to defend versus aggression right so um let's first talk about how we want to construct our check raising range and the spot on jack 10 2. so we have a really clear section of hands that that are easy to find right our best jackass king jack jack queen jack nine um even jack gates going to be strong enough and it's going to mix dip down from there with a jackass and then we have like a really um natural draws our natural draws here are going to be some eight nine some queen nine some kingdom right our gut shots are open-ended straight draws but it's just not going to be enough of hands to cut to give us board coverage on enough run outs and so the third hand type that you're going to find in this box is going to be one over card to the jack and after flush draw type stuff like the hand we have here so i go for the check raise in the spot and the opponent calls so let's first look at this flop uh in the solver and start looking at exactly what hands are talking about so two high cardboards button versus big blind forty bigs there's like a bread and butter spot um it's just gonna be a pure small bat from the opponent almost every time um you can find a little bit of bigger bats with like queens kings and maybe a little bit of like king jack off suit and stuff but most people are just going to play a pure small bat strategy um so after about 25 here's our response to the small bet as you can see we're obviously going to raise our strong jackax um and this is typical right it's like our best jacks like king jack we want to raise it every time it's just it's like the nuts on this board at this step um we need to put more money in the pot and it might feel uncomfortable to be raising hands like jack 8 jack 7 jack 6 but the bottom line is you you're playing a button player who's opening a ton of hands and they're betting their whole range so they're betting on sevens they're betting 10-8 right so jack 8 when we have it is is an extremely high equity hand we need to check raise and play aggressively so this this region here is really common we're going to be sending this spot button respect line so we have like natural bluffs here like queen 9 queen 8 king 9 and these are all very common just mixed frequencies you're going to play them as calls and check raises you'd have more coverage on uh both in your call of range now when they barrel on king or a queen um you can sometimes have straights uh also when you check grades they need to have spread so these ones are all pretty intuitive um to check grays right but the less intuitive hands that you're going to see on all these board types and this happens just in almost every single big blind versus in position single raised pot is going to be a single over card and then a low card that interacts with uh with the bottom card so in this spot we're going to see like the queen three factor flush draw the queen four king four king three this hand type is going to be chuck raised uh pretty frequently in these spots and they just have good properties you can imagine that if we only check raise a jack and you know intuitive draws the open interactive gut shots well when draw is complete on the turn it's hard to find bluffs right so we only check raise jack x sats two pairs and queen nine well on an eight turn what are you gonna bluff with right so these hand's purpose is to give you um board coverage or high ev turns um and that's why you're choosing a backdoor flush draw uh you need the backup cluster with it and one other thing that's nice about having a three and a four in your hand is you're not really blocking any of your opponent's offsuit holdings um they're gonna fold it's like when you trap grays here they're just gonna fold like the king seven king six you know a s8 a7 a6 so you're immediately kind of targeting their offsuit region of hands uh to fold right away and so having a three in your hand obviously they're not opening all two threes so that's kind of an important concept of having a low card in your hand with one over card um and then having the king gives you having king or queen gives you really good equity against their jack x and the 10x right if we if we were to check raise a hand like um nine and six suited right you're seeing it a tiny bit it but doesn't make as much into sense like king three right it's like would we ever check right seven four just just for for the heck of it because we get them toward eight high well our equity isn't good enough on run up so you need to make sure you have an over card to the top pair and then you want your second card to typically be pretty low and connected to the third the third card on the board which in this case is a deuce um so this is just like a fundamental check raising strategy you're also going to see hands that interact with the bottom pair and there's possible straight blockers on future streets and so it seems like the queen two the nine to the eight two um these are bottom pair type hands that allow you to to to do a lot with on future streets um because you're gonna have pertinent blockers on a lot of turn cards so so that would be like the the other portion of your truck raising range besides um the other ones we've talked about so just to recap big blind check raising range you're going to take your value bands right those are the easy ones to find when you have jack 10 you're going to check race up here when you have good top pair you're going to check very secure then you're going to take a mix of high equity draws that are more natural your queen 9 your king um you're eight nine etcetera uh the third hand type that you're gonna fit into a check raising strategy is gonna be a single over card hand with a back door flush draw that you get to barrel on a lot of turns that's gonna be your queen three your king three um even your ace three and ace four you're seeing gets in there a little bit as the second card gets higher like king six king seven you're doing less check raising because you're blocking more offsuit force from the opponent and then the fourth type is just going to be some smattering of bottom pair hands typically when it interacts with future straight draws and has pertinent blocks so that's kind of the first ranged construction a deep range construction that we're going to look at here so in the hand we raise the king three the opponent calls me the sixth space and we need to figure out how we're going to now approach uh this turn barrel spot after check raising the ball and a very important like game theory rule and concept that you're going to find these spots is that you have to turn equity uh to barrel the turn you don't always need to turn equity you can have equity but you need to have equity out of position when you bear which is a lot different than in position spots but when you check raise out of position you let the button player fold his air right and so their range is already somewhat condensed and so you need to have equity against their continuing range to be bluffing in the spot so on rainbow boards we're taking our backdoor flush draws that we just talked about in blah and then when it turned brings it back to flush draw it makes our life easy because we just barrel when we turn a flush draw we check when we don't because we want to have that added equity and you're going to mix your um your draws on the flop that retained their equity like the 89 so let's look at that in the solver here's the six of spades we're mixing parts in about 60 size which makes sense the turns like kind of a brick right so if we think about how we're approaching turns in general when the turn is really good for us we're going to be using more small bets which is pushing equity with our entire range when the turn is extremely bad for us we're gonna have to do way more checking and be way more polar um six is kind of like a brick right didn't really improve many of our draws uh so it's not great for us it's not bad for us so we're gonna be using a medium bed size right some potting and some about 60. i can't even show you uh that in the in the hotness here here's our turn barrel strat yeah this spot's cool right jack 10 deuce we check raise a lot of the top pairs the opponent caused a lot of ace high right and so on aces we just have to play a pure check strategy um whereas these like lower cards are kind of bricks um but better for us in general because we retain that top pair advantage that we check from the flop so these are over cards to the jack really really bad for us in general we look at all the equity 50 equity but a lack of an advantage on the queen where they turn more ace king than us um that is obviously terrible for us and that's going to lead to these strategies we're seeing here so in this hand i got the six spades and we're going to see that this kind of concept i'm talking about where you need to turn uh you need to turn equity so queen four of diamonds is just a give up we can't be barreling with with that little of little amount of equity um so you're seeing that you are barreling a deuce um because you have like reasonable two-parent trips out so it has okay equity in the spot you also are kind of getting their pairs to fold so when you barrel your deuce you're making them fold two through nines which is kind of sick and then you're barreling your higher equity draws like your queen nine continues to barrel um queen nine here continues to barrel your marginal hands that you raise in the flop like when you raise king 10 within value that kind of gets downgraded because we just condensed their range so we're doing a lot of checking with that hand type um and if we look at our spades here our spades are just putting in more money right we turned equity boom there's our rule it's kind of like our game theory trigger like okay check raise a solid strategy on flop turn equity barrel return so in this spot i barely turn for a two thirds cut size the opponent calls and we get to the river of the eight of diamonds so now we have a really interesting decision um on the eight when you think about what our overall range looks like here um obviously like our high equity straight bluffs got that right like we have queen nine so we did river some amount of new nut bands um and our jack is still really strong so we're still gonna be um betting a lot of our jacks for an all in size here which might seem thin but against really good players they're going to find enough cause of course that when you have the the queen jack here you're just saying all in the equality so anything about where our bluff should come from and in general having spades in this river doesn't seem great right like if we think about when you're approaching river bluffin you want to block their value hands and unblock their auto folds and so if we think about this river well a few autofolds they have are just their king high of space they turned equity right so if they had king eight of king five of spades they have to flip flop with the vector flusher on the other card they have to call the turn of the flush draw and they're going to fold to any size so we are blocking some auto folds which isn't great but because the eight brings um more nutted hands for us and our jack is still worth a lot we need to find bluffs um and we don't have enough combos of deuce to bluff with that this hand is gonna fall into a block at a really high frequency so i go all in and uh we get fortunate to find the phone here but let's look at that in the solver so in this spot um obviously you have less than pop back you have like 60 pop back i mostly just play an all interject strategy here i'm i'm not really finding a a smaller bet size here with the one with with the 149. it's made up of thin value best for jack which makes sense maybe i would find some of this um it's pretty hard to bluff for this small size it feels like you just want to sail then and try to like target their 10x to to find some phones so um you can see that king jack queen jack we are just saying all them most of the time i do sex is bluffing which makes sense right we're blocking some of their value um with the pocket deuces type stuff we're also blocking straights which is now huge this is kind of why we use this hand type it gives us board coverage on like straight completing rivers and turns um deuce knives blocking the straights right that's huge um sandwich queen deuce so we're bluffing these hands and then we see that our king three and our spade draws are blocking the spot and we don't love it right it's not great blocking their auto folds but we just don't have um a ton of board coverage on a run out like this such that we can have a perfect buffing canvas on every street so we go all in uh here's their autofolds right these king highs that are going to autofold but what we're targeting with this are their 10x so we're essentially targeting their king 100 their low suited 10s also ace king is queen high holding is is pretty nice so um overall pretty happy with this hand hopefully that helps you um develop strong check raising strategies as well as understanding when to better overturn um we'll keep working on like rare strategies and some of that and some of the other hands so we can we can talk more on that the last thing i want to say about the stand is uh at the start of the video i mentioned how difficult it is to defend a really wide range and i think this is a really good example of it because we look at this bet 25 raise 85 you have to peel so much like you just do have to peel all your king high back to flush draws excuse me king four king five all your acid back to flush draws and then you get barreled for about 16 the turn you're just not holding that much you know you're still calling your screen x king high um you're never folding a 10 unless that's bad blockers like 10 9 8 they're blocking some of my bluffs right uh 43s through nines but in rowdy you have to fight really hard for pots here and then we're 40 big blinds deep in a big event and you get chuck raised you get barreled for about 60 and then you get jammed on the river and you just have to look at your jack three and it's worth a lot it's like a snap on the spot um and then you have to mix calls through ten three ten four ten seven etcetera so in general i think these spots are really really difficult to defend against um so i would i would really look to be very aggressive in the big blind against wide ranges um use some of those concepts we talked about uh for developing strong block and turn strategies uh and then kind of just say good luck to your opponent i mean they have they have to defend really wide um they have to defend some ugly ugly hands on turns and rivers in in in these spots with a wide range so uh yeah this is a fun one uh let's move on to the next hand i hope that you're enjoying this high stakes pile review from poker coaching coach justin saliba i actually have another part of this series i'm happy to release for all of you here on youtube i just need one quick favor from you i need you to smash that subscribe button below if we get a hundred new subscribers from this video i'll release part two good luck and enjoy the rest of the video this next chance is going to come from a recent bellagio 10k uh opened eight six straight from the high draft big blind player defends king seven two rainbow uh this flop is just a extremely good flop for the imposition player so you're just going to best small with your entire range you have a lot of posture you're going to over realize your equity position here um and so the way these spots typically operate is you bet smalling the flop pushing your equity advantage the big blind's going to hold all their air that's going to cause equities to be a lot closer on the turn and then you're going to need to be a lot more polarized on the turn using a lot of big bets so you bet your whole range of the flop the opponent calls and now we come to a real decision point here on what to do so the reason why i chose uh this specific hand is that in the last time we talked about how when you're oop you have to have equity to barrel the turn uh that is a lot different than when you're in position here because when you're in position you actually want to have a lot of no equity blocks and the reason for that is that when you're in position you get to check back and realize all of your equity so if you have jack ten of parts here you don't want to barrel every time because at some frequency you're gonna get jammed on and when you get jammed down by hand like ace five diamonds it's really really crappy to have to fold out your equity right so when you're in position you have the added benefit that you can check and realize your equity that means that you're going to want to do that at some frequency and then you should pull your bluffs more from your no equity region of hands so what makes a good no equity block well the goal on the turn in these spots is that you want to unblock your opponent's bones so we've got really small on the flop the opponent called and we get the queen of diamonds so when we barrel for a big size here what are we targeting what are we trying to make it well a huge portion of their range gonna be a size and then we're targeting their sevens and twos that didn't turn about to flush draw right and so this 86 is going to fit really nicely into that in that we're unblocking uh a huge portion of that folding range right so i go ahead and type that pot on the turn the opponent calls and then we get the five parts kind of a brick on the river and i jam the opponent calls uh it's gonna be hard to win this one with eight six so when you put a call so we ended up losing this hand but let's look at it in piyo and uh take away some some things you guys can use on a lot of different boards king seven deuce check here's the small best strategy this king high disconnected board so you're gonna see that we have an extremely big equity advantage and even bigger uh posture so we go ahead and bet small and then it turns the queen of diamonds this is really the decision point uh we're pushing equity on the flop and then because we're going to be more polar on the turn we're going to have a really clear region of marginal hands to check and you can see that there are pocket pairs tracks through h36s uh our queen x middle pair type stuff our 7x middle pair type stuff um very clear checking region right and then our value is going to come from i mean even our weak kings right we kings are going to be marginal here so our value region is going to come from like king 9 and better essentially uh and then a smattering of gloves so it's like okay where do we pull the blocks from well one rule of thumb is if you're used to looking at a hand grip the way this spot's gonna operate is as you open more hands so like as you go from high track to button you're gonna have more of your suited kings suited jacks etc you want to choose the region of hands in this region here that interacts the board the least and those hands are going to be your no equity blocks on turns in a lot of these turn barrel spots so if we think about our number one hand interacts with our opponents with the board the least it's going to be 5 4 right 5 4 is a nothing 4 because when we pot here we're not interacting with any of the opponents forward which is which is awesome we're just going to make them both so many a sis and 7x here and we don't need the equity right so you're gonna see jack 10 does a lot more checking a hand like ace nine of diamonds is a perfect example right if we pot a side of diamonds we're making the opponent hold eight six of diamonds right we pot they fold eight six of diamonds okay so we're making them forward a lot of these highs that are worse than us we're making them worse diamond draws than us it's like that's not really where we want to be we much rather just prefer to we must purge the chat realize our equity cooler the diamonds on diamond rivers cooler the worst a sex on ace rivers and then have equity with the nine right and just show down value in general so you don't always need to turn equity when you're in position you more so want to focus on your low equity blocks the 5-4 the 6-5 the 8-6 the 9-6 right the jack-8 all these hands are very low equity hands but they do a really nice job of unblocking the opponent's folding range uh and so they're going to be used a lot as in position turn barrels so hopefully this is showing the difference between in position turn barreling and atoms and terminal where we have to have equity out of position in position you just don't need it so we pot in the opponent oh and that doesn't mean you're not going to barrel any right so like your ace four of diamonds makes a lot of sense your ace four in general makes a lot of such a barrel turn for big size because you're making all their all the better asexuals it gives you cleaner outs on uh an ace river and you're unblocking more diamond draws that continue right so yeah you're making is 1004 that's a huge win for these four shooters or a ace for uh even a parts right so you're barreling these aces way more um than like your h10 h9 type stuff even though ace 10 and h9 look like a draw right it looks like a hand that you would want to barrel when you're in position you get to just check back into azure equity so we go with the barrel on the turn and then we're going to get a low blank on the river the five parts we go for the jam so [Music] we're going to be thinking again about how we should construct our river where our where we should pull our river blocks from right and i want you to think about what the worst and what the worst card in the deck to hold is uh on the river so give you maybe seven seconds the worst card in the deck is gonna be the ace of diamonds right ace of diamonds is going to block the opponent's auto folds with that tiny on the flop they called they turn it back to a flush draw what is the number one autofold on the river it's going to be their a size of diamonds right when they have ace nine of diamonds things like that so we're actually not going to bluff our diamonds very much as you can see a sport of diamonds plays a pure check we are blocking their auto bones that's terrible when we're river blocking right whereas if you compare it to our lower diamonds you're finding a little bit more blocks right but even your jacket is not good enough you just have to check back and it doesn't feel good right you you take jack eight of diamonds that flop your bed turn you shouldn't have jackpot in the river but the bottom line is you have really bad card removal it's a really it's two really bad cards to hold in your hand because when you jam you're blocking the ace jack of diamonds you're blocking the ace eight of diamonds these are pure bowls right so river bluffing is all about blockers and our hand 86 of spades fits perfectly into a river block we have eight high so we benefit a ton from bluffing our hand and getting anything to fold and we're not blocking any of the folds really right when we have eight six of spades um as we talked about earlier the a6 is still bluffing here because it's blocking many fewer of uh of the opponent's boats than like the jack high ones but when you have the h3 of clubs it's a perfect hand to bluff off with you because you're unblocking all the opponents um hopefully that shows you how to approach turn barreling uh turn range construction when you're in position and then another example of how to structure your river blocking ring all right the last hand uh part one we're going to go back to a oop big blind spot uh the button play raises from a recent uh 15k from a few days ago um called the five three off suit we queen six six rainbow jack turn off super so i think that this hand fits nicely into uh what we've been talking about over the previous two hands because it's a really good example of how op you're gonna mostly just want to have equity when you you know we talk about barely in return with check raise how you want equity when you put money in the pot the same thing happens with turn probes um and so most of your range is going to want to have extra equity because you're out of position uh putting a lot of money in the pot so we think about what that size we want to use when probing this term well what does our value feel like it wants to how much money does our value want to put in are we going to be really polar or is the board is so good for us that we're gonna be betting small well in this fight we're gonna be really bolder right because when we bet we're saying i have a six or i have a queen right we're not gonna we don't have a huge portion of value of like middling equity hands we either kind of have air or we have a pretty strong hand so i'm sure we're showing it some that 25 with like weaker queen x or some low fours that want some protection but in general our sixes want to go for a really big size here so when we put a lot of money in the pot oop we need to have equity right uh and so we're going to see that in the solver especially with if we think about um like like proper runouts and proper high uv rivers we want to have a heart in our head when we're betting right if if we have five three oh no heart we have less high ev rivers that we need to buff on right whereas if we have five three oh with the heart we need to bluff on more runouts more and more rivers in the situation so having a heart can be really nice and spot plus uh so even though it's not added equity we're gonna have uh more high ev rivers so that's gonna turn this hand into a really high frequency turnpro so i go with the pot size bet the opponent calls let's look at that decision point in the server so we have check really heavy check board for position massive off suit six disadvantage and we get the four spades here's the offseason sixes i was talking about um and you see that our six is gonna put a lot of money in the pot now we're gonna have some stickers that don't want to put a lot of money in the pot and that's gonna be like queen six when we're blocking their top pairs right um and a6 the fun thing about a6 is one who gets cooler there he's highs when he goes check check and two when you have an ace in your hand um you're blocking your opponent's turn checkbox right so it weights them slightly to having more non-ace high hands which means they're going to bluff versus your check slightly more often than for example when you have 10 6 right so that's why the a6 finds tracks the queen 6 finds small bats and checks and then most years want to put a lot of money in the pot and then you're stripping some bet 25 that we talked about with like decent queen x some poor's the one protection uh et cetera and then if we think about where your bluff should come from well the rule is okay we need equity right so our first blocks are going to come from where they come from our flush drops they have the most equity so we look at our hearts and all of our non-shutdown value hearts are putting money in the pot like a huge portion of them right these have the pair of pores with them so they have shown on value a silence trying to buy a good king kind of um so our hearts are a big place where we're drawing our bluffs from another place is going to be coming from our draw our straight draws right so you have your five seven you have your five threes um now we talked about high ev rivers here's how here's where you can see that when you have a heart in your hand you're going to barrel at a higher frequency because you get to block more rivers right so you're seeing pure bluffs with the five through the heart and mixing with the rest of them now you need to find a few other bluffs in the spot and so our typical rule where it's like you have equity on oop you can barrel that hand as well it still is true but in this spot you need some board coverage uh so you do take your best blocker type hands which which makes some sense right because say you only bet uh your straight draws your flush draws in your trips for pot size right what are you gonna bluff with on the seven of hearts right you're gonna have so many nut hands and and not enough to block with uh and so when he goes check check the opponent does have more air which means you don't have to be quite as choosy with what you're barreling with and so what are your best blocker hands here it's gonna be high hearts with a low car that's unblocking stuff so you have like uh your king 2o here your king2o with the heart uh it gets to bluff at some frequency because the heart allows you board coverage on a heart river allows you to block those uh bluff those runs at high frequency your two is unblocking all the middling cars that the buttonhouse like when you pot the spot look at all these offsuit hands that are holding right all the better king x report all these better asexual holding when you pop so you're getting you're unblocking all these middling hands when you have a two in your hand it's just like a really uh typical best blocker hand out here so that's the only kind of exception to the spot of you need equity in the spot to better not not bear on this about your probing but um yeah so we go with the paw size bet here i hope that makes sense on on why our strategy is that way the opponent calls on the river we get the nine of spades so here's our second decision point in the hand all right what do we do here well let's think about how our blockers interact with the run-up is the nine good for a range or bad for our range well i'm gonna say it's pretty freaking bad for us right for our overall strategy on the turn we're betting a lot of high equity stuff in sixes so our sixes are still nuts but none of our high equity stuff improved right i mean our nines with the heart made a nine that's it uh high equity turns would be like our high equity rule would be like a three um a five a seventh heart especially like the ace of hearts would be an incredibly good card for us right because um we are bluffing with all of our lower parts and so we make so many flushes on the river uh but the nine is kind of a brick and so even though we have five highs here we don't actually have really good blockers to any value bands um our five parts isn't great here because it's blocking some of the opponent's auto folds that don't bet flop call the big turn bet and then would hold the river such as um king five parts for example uh and so we actually don't have a great bluffing candidate here we'd much rather bluff with our seven five clubs here uh there are five three with the heart in it so let's see that in the solver uh and make sure that that's correct it's the nine of spades so we're extremely polarity right because it's not a good card for us it's a brick six is still the nuts but it didn't improve any of our uh any of our bluffs on the turn and so we're extremely polar here our only size is almost 2x here with all of our king and so let's think about how our hearts are going to do on the river well our hearts are giving up right our hearts are pure checking they have bad blockers on the river we look at the 530 when we have a heart it's a lower frequency especially the five parts because they are autofolding they actually have to find some calls they spot is high with ace five parts because we're never blocking with that card right but in general all these five part hands are auto folded so our five hearts are really really bad blocker let's think about what would be a good bluffing candidate here what two or three in our hand we know is a good thing right because we're unblocking the most amount the incident player can have and then we don't want to have hearts let's look at like clubs five deuce of clubs here all in right we're not blocking any folds it's a perfect hand to just run it with um king of clubs deuce right the deuce of hearts is way uh less bad for us because they have way fewer deuce aparts in their range than they do five parts in their range right so on this river we have to be really disciplined here i definitely had an issue for a long time it's too difficult to pop the turn and then check five high on the river right it's it's it's a it's a funny thing but when you're really trying to play at a high level um you're just going to be thinking about how does my hand fit into my range okay the nine means that i have to be polar in the spot really really bolder and if i'm going to be polar i have to have my best bluffing candidate because i don't get to bluff a ton of run-outs so hopefully that shows more on the turn probing and also on choosing river bluffing candidates i want to look at a good river to look at betting frequency and our polarity right so if we get any heart here look at our betting frequency right our betting frequency is infinitely higher because if you think about our overall turn strategy we improve with so many of our blocks that we get to bat at a way higher frequency in general so now our five three boom we find pure velocity when we have the heart and i think that makes sense how about a non-heart low card a non-hard load card is way better for us because some of our straight draws get in so we're still very polar but our frequency goes up right our betting frequency in the seven of hearts is like you know 32 percent checks versus the 9 56 right so it's all about thinking um about how the rivers affect our overall turn range and then using that to decide okay what's my frequency going to be what's my size going to be and how do my hands fit into my overall range so i hope this video uh helps you guys play these op and imposition barrel or probe spots better uh and i hope this helps you uh you know decide river bluffing frequencies and uh river bluffing canvas so thanks guys um looking forward to part two talk soon bye", metadata={'source': 'eQQC1BXaGBs', 'title':

[Document(page_content="so we are going back to basics but we're going to turn it into a premium way of doing it so uh today the topic is how to study and learn your pre-flop languages um i see some of my students here in the chat and in the session and they kind of know how much of a stickler i am for pre-flop um i question a lot of pre-flop decisions i'm a big stickler for pre-flop play because i think pre-flop is the most important street in the all of poker and the reason is is you make uh pre-flop decisions every single hand that's number one so you make them a lot that makes them important number two if you make a mistake pre-flop you're also going to make mistakes on the flop on the turn on the river and mistakes compound so mistakes pre-flop while they seem very subtle in the moment are going to cost you a lot of money on later streets so i am a big um poker's redheaded stepchild pre-flop yeah all right i want you to be honest in the in the chat here how many of you enjoy studying pre-flop how many of you enjoy studying pre-flop you guys are all liars you guys are liars no one loves studying pre-flop it's boring all right now for a serious question okay i want you to answer i want you to take a second and i want you to be very very honest in the last month of playing poker i'm not talking push fold charts okay i'm not studying talking about studying your 10 big blind push call ranges how many hours in the last month have you studied spent studying pre-flop ranges so for example your flat calling ranges your race for sin ranges uh how many hours have you spent in the last month studying pre-flop ranges so i've seen answers from zero to ten and a lot of answers around three four you know i'll tell you guys this so i have been playing for 15 years professionally now and i still try to dedicate an hour a week to studying pre-flop game and that's after all the hours i put um in poker and stuff and i'm consistently still trying to study and improve my pre-flop strategies and so you know i probably spend four to five hours like four hours a month but that's strictly dedicated to pre-flop and then when i'm reviewing hands and stuff i pretty much check my pre-flop spots every single time when i'm reviewing hands and stuff so that's not accounting those but like i spent a lot of work on pre-flop because i think it's important and pre-thought can be pretty intimidating there's like i don't even know how many charts on there like there's probably like i don't know 5 000 charts on here 3 000 charts a thousand charts i don't even know if you go through every single little pre-flop range there's a lot of charts and it gets pretty hard to memorize so what we're going to go at today is i'm going to tell you guys how i in-game how i think about and construct my pre-flop ranges and i have some simple heuristics and rules that really help me nail down my pre-flop strategies to free up my mind to think about other things and the the reason i really like the way i think about pre-flop ranges is because it really helps me post flop and this will probably come up later but um i'll explain that how it comes up later so let me get my questions up here okay let me see here all right so we're going to start off really basic and we'll get more advanced as the seminar goes on today um there's not like a structured powerpoint you know anything like this this is just kind of me going through stuff telling you how i think about things we're going to be doing a lot of guess and check work today so 40 big blinds we are the button and whoa no no no i don't want to show you okay this is not what we're looking at i want you guys in chat to tell me 40 big blinds on the button raised first in what where do you um how do you tell me very quickly what's the bottom of your opening range i want to know what the bottom of your opening is range is very quickly how do you think about right now i say what's your button opening range 40 big blinds i want like a three second two second answer of how you describe that to me okay i see a lot of good answers now i see two different types of answers okay first i'll go to the ones so some of you guys are answering 50 of hands which is correct you're raising about 50 percent of hands from the button that is correct but can you tell me what 50 is what's the bottom of your opening range with 50 of hands when you answer when you tell me you're opening 50 percent of hands from the button what's the bottom of your opening range so i really like um you know there's a people that have been answering and i will add a lot of them are my students the way i'm going to structure my pre-flop ranges so a lot of the answers were correct but i think the answers that are the best correct are the ones that mention the bottom of their offset range and the bottom of their suited range so 40 big blinds on the button i know right now my opening range is suited fives off suit eights and i mix i mix with offsuit sevens and suited fours okay off suit eights and sevens and i mix with uh it's basically you know all off suit eights all suited fives and i know i mixed with suited fours and offsuit sevens uh right where you are chatting jaclyn so 40 big blinds on the button i mentioned offsuit eights suited fives okay this is a 51 range most people said yeah i raised 50 of hands but at least for me personally it's really hard is eight six suited in the top fifty percent is jack five student at top fifty percent um yeah mark this is where you're gonna type the chat um off suit eights suited fives and right now i know okay i'm starting to mix with some student fours i know i'm mixing with offsuit sevens but the really easy way for me personally what i think is the easiest way for people to do this is to remember button 40 big blinds we're raising offsuit eights and suited fives yeah you're not supposed to see the chat guys uh yeah you guys are not i'm the only one that can see the chat so that way you can answer without having to you know worry about other people seeing your answers so when i ask a question there's 109 of you i got about 30 answers so that means about 70 of you didn't answer okay so you want to get the most out of this i know it's new year there's a lot of new people here um you guys need to answer the questions so that's the best way to get something out of this so this is going to be interactive um yeah so definitely answer the questions offsuit eights suited fives okay 40 big blinds um it's going to stay pretty consistent like i know i mixed with offset sevens um you know and then you can kind of fudge from there if you just get suited fives and off suit eights obviously like i think most people know they're gonna raise all their off suit aces they're gonna raise you know if you miss like jack 4 jack 3 10 4 you know jack 7 king 5 you're going to hit 90 percent of this range right there just by hitting suited fives off suit eights okay i think that's a lot easier way to remembering than just oh i'm raising 51 percent of hands well is nine seven off suit in top fifty percent of hands it's a tough answer to the question i couldn't tell you but i could tell you offsuit eights and suited fives do i put these heuristics in a quizlet or something that i drill um it's kind of memorization so yeah you could drill so what i'll do here i'll just make a notepad with you this is how i kind of study uh 40 bbs button rfi offsuit eights suited fives and i'll put mix sevens and suited fours okay that's my button opening range do i fold a7 off and a6 off with 40 big blinds no how i do it is that's the base of my range i'm covering a lot of it now it's pretty easy to figure out well you're obviously going to raise more aces and more kings than just offsuit eights because aces and kings are strong suited fives obviously they're gonna raise more suited aces to do fours suited threes um the point is to get like the bottom of the range hands like nine five suited is a hand most people miss and don't raise on the button jack eight off suit is a ham most people miss and don't raise on the button these are the hands that make up a large portion of the weight right here that most people miss for example um someone put their raisins suited sixes off suit nines like you're missing a huge chunk of the range then if you're missing those hands uh right where you guys are typing these questions where do i type my answers into the questions box yep that's where you type it um these are all tournament ranges too i saw some people mention cash games these are all tournaments all my topics that you see me do on poker coaching are all gonna be tournaments we think the big blind three bets often that we could full queen three suited no i'd fall i can guarantee you the big blind is not three betting enough for you to fold queen three suited you should never go tighter than this range almost ever is it really that important to have the exact range considering that the french hands or your ev's radios i think it is because you would never these are all very profitable raises and you can probably expand to go more than these ranges because people are going to overfold their big blind and overfold post lock so i could i even personally go wider than this range but this is the base of my range um all right so all students student fives mix sevens and suited fours so okay same drill 40 big blinds cut off what's your raised first end range from the cutoff off suit nine student sixes a lot of people are saying okay so i see a lot of people getting pretty good um i see a lot of pretty good answers two to fives off suit eights uh off suit ten suited two okay i'm saying a lot of good answers a lot more people answered so now i gotta clear them all out a lot of good answers um okay and i see a lot of people still doing percentages but do you really know what 40 of your range is so we're in the cutoff 40 bbs cut off rfi i can tell you right here off suit nines and suited sixes okay kind of a lot easier what do we raise on the button off suit eights now we're in the cutoff we're gonna be tighter offsuit nines student fives on the button well now we're at suited sixes okay button we're gonna switch this to the cutoff boom what do you know offsuit nines suited sixes all right whatever nine six suited mix this fold i probably raise it because i think of suited sixes who cares um so last suit nine suited sixes you just raised most of your cutoff range obviously offsuit nines you're going to raise more offsu aces than just like these hands i i know personally like k8 off is the bottom of the kx range i know h5 off is the bottom of that range but like the point of this is to get a majority of the range right like i know i'm raising more suited kings suited queens um but now you are getting a majority of the range here with the cutoff okay 40 bb hijack offsuit 10s suited sevens you guys are starting to see the pattern right you guys it's just like you just get a little bit tighter so now you go to the hijack 40 big blinds boom offsuit tens suited sevenths much easier way to think of these ranges you go to the high the low jack okay now like the low jack i think off c10 the off c10s are still gonna stay in it's gonna be like offsuit tens and suited eights in the low jack does the range change if you're playing low stakes no it does not it actually would potentially get wider if people are too tight and don't three bet you enough so 40 bb low jack i'm going to say these are like me my guesses this is how i make sure i'm doing it right so off suit 10 still i'm gonna say officer tens suited eights in the low jack low jack boom suited eights i'll suit tens okay i'm nailing almost all the range right now you know if i'm missing king five suited or something like i know i'm gonna probably if i know suited eights i'm not raising i'm raising king seven suited at least um under the gun one we're gonna start to go to the suited nines and mix up it's gonna be like offsuit jacks okay so now these off suit tens are coming out so it's off suit jacks and now the suited eights are still in there at under the gun one so and then under the gun it goes to suited nines officer jacks okay seems like a lot of people thought that i've seen a lot of um the same under the gun one and under the gun two are the correct are the same uh this is under the gun seven this is under the gun eight that's how i think about it this is an under the gun eight handed and this is under the gun seven handed i'm way too tight under gun one how do you vary these ranges if there's disparity in sacrifices between you and the blinds um that way you have to use some you know if you have 40 big blinds and you know you have to start to use some fudge work on which ranges you want to start to use depending on um like if ever if you have 40 big blinds and obviously everyone else has 20 big blinds you're going to be raising a 20 big blind range because that's effectively the stack size that you're playing if you have like three people that are playing 20 big blinds and one player playing 30 you're probably going to raise like 20 big blind rangers because you have three big three re-jam stacks so you just have to be tight um i kind of personally use 40 big blinds as my base base point um we can just look at like the button here for example um um i know when we go to say 20 big blinds on the button we need to race tighter because we're going to get rejammed on so like these offseason dates are going to come out so we go to offsuit nines so at 20 big blinds now we're back to offsuit nines and the suited fives come out so it's obviously gonna be a little tighter at 20 big blinds gonna go regen on the point is to not get this perfect but to have a very good heuristic to help you in game quickly realize what your race for sin ranges there okay to be slighter to be slightly tighter or slightly looser it depends on your skill level if you're a very if you're a comfortable post flop i'd probably be a little looser than this if you're if you're not comfortable post flop you could be a little bit tighter do you ever visualize the graphics on the right rather than memorize the numbers i don't really memorize the numbers i know the numbers um like i just know them but um i think of it exactly how i'm describing it can i please repeat under the gun one you guys have access to all these ranges by the way under the tools you just go to tools here and you go to gto pre-flop charts you guys all have access to these so any of these ranges you want to go back and see later um because there's so many of you in here today you can go back and you know you can do this you can pull this up right now while i'm doing the webinar so raise first end ranges are pretty easy right because they're always static in terms of there's not other variables and you just know like there's only one time it folds to you in the low jack and you have to figure it there's no other positions you have to adjust for so we're going to get a little trickier now okay and we're going to use the same principles that we just used and let's go to a very very common situation 40 big blinds effective it folds to the button who raises to 2.3 x okay small blindfolds you're in the big blind very quickly tell me what your range your defending range looks like i don't care if it's three letter call i just want to know about which hands you're vpipping very quickly everything you're laughing because you know that's probably not right a lot of people are so i think it's close so it is all suited combos so a lot i think a majority of people were getting the suited part right that you defend all suited combos 40 big blinds okay but the offsuit side is where it gets a little tricky i haven't studied these ranges someone said yeah a lot of people don't study pre-flop ranges because pre-flop is not that fun to study um but it's the most important thing to study which uh you know this is kind of like the base fundamental to everything so all right 40 big blinds uh your big blind facing a raise from the button okay so i'm going to do this 40 big blinds big blind burst button open i'm going to tell you very quickly in three seconds what my my defending range is off suit sixes all all suited okay offsuit sixes all suited boom every offsuit six is in there all suited cards now every off suit six i kind of how i personally do it is i know well obviously i'm gonna defend more offsuit kings i just know i'm defending all offsuit kings um you're probably gonna defend like if you missed queen do soft queen three off you're gonna be doing just fine if you miss jack four off you'll be fine if you miss like this stuff over here you're doing fine but off suit sixes all suited hands and then just remember hey i gotta defend more i'll suit kings and queens because those are higher cards everyone see here very clear offsuit sixes are the floor of the range and later on we're gonna figure out how this helps us a lot pre-flop okay opposite sixes okay um so 40 big blinds versus the button offset sixes are the bottom of the range what about versus cutoff we'll do this big blind work a decent amount because most people over fold their big blind so we're going to spend some time on this cut off how do you do your offsea range from the cutoffs good most people are getting it all right right away perfect offsuit sevens all suited most people are getting it perfect off suit sevens and all suited you see like i'm guessing here before um i'm guessing here before i even look at it like just because like i've done some work here boom off suit sevens suited hands you see now we're starting to mix with these offset sixes they're starting to mix out obviously we're gonna call the ones that can make it straight down here and we're gonna call the high card ones but these middlemen ones are now coming out same with the middling fives so okay hi jack not going to ask probably going to be off suit eights see now on the hijack these mid lane offsuit sevens are starting to come out still all the suited hands the lojack is going to still be off suit eights i believe yep so the logitech range is kind of the same still off suit eights once we get to under the gun one these off suit h should start mixing out so they're still kind of in their jacket and then under the gun is off suit nines i know so under the gun versus under the gun we're at offsuit nines uh and you start to see under the gun is where these off suit aces start to mix out okay so off suit nines is the floor of the range versus under the gun and now you see like seven deuce unfolds but you don't really need to remember that if you call 70 suited you're probably not making too big of a mistake versus under the gun but if you want to get perfect and realize it you're like yes i fold seven do suit it but that's really not that important it's only four combos but learning that you shouldn't call queen six off versus the big blind is probably pretty important because now you're three pips off your range okay do i play pretty much a cash game strategy when i'm 100 big blinds deep um i don't think so tournament ranges are way different than cash game ranges guys because we have aunties and cash games don't yep all suited hands still have very good equity versus under the gun so right away you can realize versus under the gun the tightest range you never pull the suit down so essentially don't fold suited hands in the big blind versus a single raise so this is a good question uh generally oh someone asked what i mean by pip when i say that queen six off like queen seven off would when i say like one pip off like you know if you defend queen eight off here you're fine because you're just like one pip off like queen nine which is a call so generically what do you mix out first when the bet size is a little bit bigger so as a general rule i'll write this in the notes offsuit hands are very uh sensitive to ray size suited hands are not very sensitive to race sizing so what do i mean all these ranges are versus like a 2.2 x okay so let's just look at the button let's go back to the button here to make it simple yes these are tournament ranges um big blind versus raise from the button so this is versus a 2.2 x okay so if there's a min raise i'm probably going to expand here i'll probably defend jack three and jack deuce for the min raise i'll probably just expand all these offshoot hands six four four three like i'm gonna raise wider if they make it like 2.5 x i'm probably taking out a lot of these off suit fives and even starting to mix out these offsuit sixes uh your offsuit hands are gonna be very sensitive to the race size and the um suited hands are probably not too sensitive do i adjust for different positions of course what if it's a 3.5 x i mean i don't know the exact answer versus a 3.5 x but i'm going to play way tighter than this range versus a 3.5 than a 2.2 uh suited hands have a lot better equity realization than offshore hands so when people are only opening the two big blinds you should go much wider you i would i simplify now normally i know i'm off two sixes i probably very simply would go to offsuit fives at the minimum does it go tighter when you go to 60 bit blinds nope stays pretty much the same um it's not going to go much tighter i think it's still going to be off suit sixes yeah off c6 has come in you even see like 10 5 8 5 come in a little bit so we're actually almost at like offsuit 5s at 60 big blinds so it actually went a little looser with how much annie are those ranges calculated um to be honest i don't know i'm assuming it's a normal like 10 percent anti why is 40 big blinds your baseline because that's probably the stack size that is like it's a really good point because you can adjust downwards for when you're 20 big blinds you can adjust upwards for 60 that's just how i've always done it so now we're going to get a little bit trickier okay so making it trickier now probably the stuff that i've given you easy questions so far all this stuff has been pretty easy if you play like you know seriously if you study pre-flop you probably knew you know maybe not exactly but you had a pretty good idea of the ranges you know i asked pretty simple questions so we're going to get tougher now okay 40 big blinds you're on the button facing a 2.3 cutoff race tell me very quickly what hand you beat pip what's your vpip range what's your vpip range 40 big blinds button basically 2.3 x rage in the from the cutoff go off suit jackson eight so again if you're saying 37 percent i want you to know what you need to know what 37 percent of hands is i don't know what 37 of your hands is i couldn't tell you so i'm assuming a lot of people as well couldn't tell you if i've been doing this for 15 years and i can't tell you what 37 hands is i'm assuming a lot of you can't offset tens suited eights there's gonna be some suited sevens in there but it's only gonna be like the ones that can make straights so versus the cutoff uh this is at 60 i want to go to 40. offsuit 10s suited eights i'm not worrying about right now three bet versus call we're not going to worry about that right now off suit tens suited eights all right now you kind of extrapolate that to like oh probably gonna defend more suited kings suited kings are really good hands we're down to like king four suited obviously i think most people know they should call every suited ace at least and then like you know nine seven suited sneaks in there because it can make a straight so a lot of people were saying like suited sevens but a lot of the suited sevens come out and a lot of people were saying off suit nines that was way too wide okay offsuit tens suited eights all right we're gonna go to the extreme now if you are facing the if you are on the button 40 big blinds button facing a we'll just say under the gun 8 race what's your vpip what's your vpip here 40 big blinds button facing out of the gun eight by under the gun eight i mean under the gun in this sim under the gun eight handed is what i mean so the range isn't gonna change that much okay what's gonna come out is this like jack turn off queen turn off and a little bit of king turnoff's gonna come out it's mostly gonna be like off-suit jack suited eights that's what i'm gonna get at we're mixing off suit tens how i think about as i mix off suit tens suited eights are still in their peer okay so we're gonna go versus down to the gun okay so off suit tens are out so it's off suit jacks and suited eights so the suited eights stay in that's very constant it doesn't matter what position i'm not going to play well with suited eights versus another gonna raise i think you guys underestimate how easy it is to play well you're in position you just call a lot of bets you know you just call when you flop some equity and stuff suited seven's too wide yep suited sevens are too wide i mean you're calling some suited sevens but most the middle ones when mixing do you based on um pretty much every hand that mixes here i kind of call because i think people play awful post flop but that's me so um you know if you fold the queen 18 and jackets you like these hands are worth zero so if you fold these hands you're doing fine um jack jack better a call than a three bet yeah mostly just calls we're against under the gun most people are saying oh i'm so wrong or i'm so tight good you guys are identifying where you need to study more knowing these ranges makes post flop so much easier so student dates so basically how i remember my button versus vpip is um this is how i remember it literally button verse any position off suit tense due to dates and then i add the caveat off stu tens mix out as pfr gets to earlier position so that's the only thing i gotta remember i remember off suit tens suited eights and i remember the opposite tens mix out as the pre-flop parades gets earlier position so versus cut off all the tens are in there versus hijack now jack 10 off starts to come out versus lojack now like these two are out king 10 off is still in versus lojack versus under the gun 7 king 10 off now is still in there a little bit but still in there and then versus under the gun now like queen jack off starting about the only real spot that changes is the offsuit side these are the only four combos that really change every other hand suited eights are all in there versus every range right like these change a little bit this changes a little bit but just like these are the only hands that really change depending on the position your range is pretty static no matter the position that raises here what changes your what changes is your three bet range so like versus cutoff we three bet a lot of this weaker stuff here you know versus under the gun we don't think about this stuff we three but you know some stronger hands so like you'd have to look in and do some study there but that's the only thing that's changing but our actual v-pip range doesn't really change much depending on the position makes sense all right so let's do another one cut off um 40 bb cut off versus hijack raise what is your cut off b pip range go what is your cutoff v-pip versus a hijack 40 big blinds let's go no one's answered don't use the charts all right jacko got it off suit jacks suited nines okay before it was offset 10 suited eights now we're in the cutoff so um cutoff versus raise from the hijack offset jacks suited nines offsuit jacks suited nines off suit jack student nines okay and if you go to under the gun now you see like these ossie jacks start to phase out but the pseudonyms stay so we're very sensitive the we're seeing a pattern here okay um we're seeing a pattern here that the position the rays comes from really only affects the offset side but like here it doesn't even affect it much like queen jack's already mixing now king jack starts to come off if we're against under the gun but suited nines stay lit stay in like k8 suited still in there like this stuff i think is kind of intuitive you can figure out oh 98 suited 108 suited these are the better suited eights they're probably going to come in yep no king 10 off you got the buttons still behind you so okay well i'm just going to go through a little quicker here so hijack we're gonna be like offsuit queens suited tons smaller studio connectors are dropping off yeah so like that's something to point out here is like these suited connectors are dropping off now like in the cutoff in the hijack but these mix strategies to use a random number generator do you mentally make them more straightforward and more implementable um most of the time if a hand is like you know mixing like jack 9 suited what's going to depend here so this is in the hijack what's going to depend if you call here if you have really tight players behind you that don't squeeze then this probably becomes a full frequency call so you want to know who's left to act like how often they squeeze and you want to know um like who's on the button who's in the big blind how likely you're getting over called so it depends on the players behind you it's the three bet and the call percentage based on the other players i mean not really it's kind of based off of like how often you're gonna get squeezed and stuff if that's what you mean pseudo connectors come back in with bigger sacks right not really people flat suit connectors too much like if you go to here at like 80 big blinds you're still folding suited connectors i mean they come back in a little bit but you're still folding mostly they're all break even calls with 80 big blinds so two connectors not very good hands people not very good hands people you have a tip or trick for 66 33 raised call scenarios yes i kind of do oh we'll get into that in a few minutes let's cover this stuff first once you've gotten to know your v-pip what your range is v-piping it becomes things become a lot easier in all situations okay so we don't really need to worry about like low jack versus under the gun it's going to be like most your offseason comes out suited tens stay in no matter what every position suited suited like even under the gun one versus under the guns two to ten stay in so suita tens are always gonna be the pipped okay and then like most your offseason stuff is out here now the next queen off that's not the point of this notice now too most of your suited aces are out here people flat too much with suited aces okay so what is the best way of learning this it's grunting work you got to go in you got to realize just kind of make a sheet just like this this is what like this is how i memorize i look at all right what's my v-pip car like it's pretty easy now i see a pattern and the cutoff offsuit nines hijack offsuit tens low jack offsuit tens once you get to earlier positions like offsuit queens two to sixes suited seven suited eights like it's one pip up like it's just kind of it's all pattern it's easily memorizable because like you've seen i've gotten almost every single one right it's because i've spent the time kind of working on this the way i'm doing it i think is the best way to memorize it do you recommend we study push-pull charts the same way yeah i think it's a good way to study push-pull charts as like well know at eight big blinds you should have all suited nines and that you know ten big blinds you shove all suited eights you know just kind of do it that way that's how i memorize things all right we have looked at race first in ranges we've looked at vpip ranges right next all right so let's talk about three bet versus call a lot of people have that issue so now you know cutoff opened and we're on the button what are we v pipping 40 big blinds we're on the button cutoff open what are we v pipping quick good offsuit 10s suited eights off suit tens suited eights okay so we know that now we so we've answered the question very quickly we know what we're v pipping right but how do we figure out which hands we want a three bet right that's the next question for value it's kind of easy most people know what type of hands you want a three-part value but where you want a three-bet for bluffs well um an easy way there's a couple ways to look at it so galen says the top and the bottom of those yep i think that's one good way to think of it you're going to kind of three bet your worst hands that you're v-pipping it's pretty good strategy if you just tend to take the worst hands that you've e-pip three bet them three-bet your best hands probably gonna be doing pretty well um if you want to get more technical the way i do it involves thinking back one step what hands does the cutoff raise okay 40 big blinds cut off raises what are the worst offsuit hands that the cutoff raises we care about offsuit hands y so vivian got it so many people got it off suit nines correct so the cutoff raises offsuit nines that's the bottom of the cutoff phrase right cut off rfi offsuit nines okay why are we why do we care why do i care where the uh what the bottom of the offseat range is for the cutoff yeah so most people got it there's more way more combos of offsuit hands so now let's let's kind of walk through this when i three bet what hands is the cutoff gonna fold right away when i three bet when i'm bluffing i want them to fold obviously what hands are they gonna fold right away what's the biggest block of hands they're gonna fold bottom of the range okay what hands are those probably offsuit nines okay so if we look here we're not gonna look at my three betting range and we'll see if we're gonna we can we're gonna see if we can work through to figure out what hands we should three but so i go cut off okay versus a three bet from the button hey what do you know what's folding offsuit nines right some offsuit tens are folding two offsuit nines and tens are where like this is like pretty much no suited hands are folded this is four eight 12 16 20 24. 28 combos of suited hands are folding okay that's equal to 10 nine off and jack nine off okay that's why we don't care about the suited side so these are all the where the full they pulled 34 percent of hands 30 of those they pulled 187 they fold 176 combos three by all in no no no no uh this is oh this is four but this is the four bet that's why you see it this is the four bet range this is the defend versus three bit you only have all in or call range so they fold 180 combos we'll say for easy math and 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 of those combos are suited hands 28 divided by 180 15 of their folds are suited hands what does that mean 85 percent of their folding range is offsuit hands 85 percent of their hands are offsuit hands are folding what hands are gonna fold offsuit nines offsuit tents so let's work out who can take a guess what types of hands are we gonna three bet from the button what's an easy way to think about what types of hands that we wanna three bet from the button so you know what's the bottom of our flatting range what's the bottom of our v pip range from the button so a lot of people are saying off suit eights do we have off suit eights do we do we v-pip any offsuit eights from the button yep so i like joe's answer i like darren's answer okay so i've seen some good answers one above the cut off fully remains three bit okay so let's work backwards okay i'm gonna pull up my note sheet so you guys can see this okay so 40 dbs button verse cutoff open okay so cutoff worst opens are offsuit nines and tens ones ones that fold button worst v-pips are off suit tens and suited eights and you can't follow this replay is gonna be up you can go ahead you can replay this as many times you can pause and start it and take notes okay so our three bet range is going to be very heavy suited eights and offsuit tens for a couple of reasons first we want to three bet these suited eights because we don't block folds so we don't want to have a nine in our range when we three bet because that's the hands they're folding so they're opening off suit nines we're gonna three bet suited eights okay and that you know kind of correctly it just is the bottom of our range suited eights and offshoot tense is the bottom of our range yep so i like liam's answer under his worst offsuit hand hands that benefit from folding the bottom yep and this is why we're three betty we want a three bet queen eight suited because we get queen nine off um we get queen ten off we get dominated hands to fold yeah we to be what above their bottom range so when we look here so i just guessed right here okay i said we're going to be three betting suited eights in offsuit tents when we go cut off um we're gonna go button versus um raise from the cut off off suit tens suited eights you know it's not like perfect this strategy but you can start to see it a little bit and then like king seven king six king five these hands they don't interact with the uh the folding range from the button if we go to 60 big blinds this might be a little clearer for these three bet because we three bet more so here you see it a lot better we're three betting off suit tens and suited eights a lot queen eight jack eight nine eight season ten seven nine seven these are all like the worst hands that we flat so with the off c10s don't we block king ten queens and they're folding yep we are but um like in general your worst offsuit hands are just always going to perform better is three bets offsuit hands just don't flat call very well because they uh don't play well multi-way yeah like three times the raise is fine so if you kind of see here we're just three betting on the suited side pretty much this is pretty much just three betting the worst of our flatting range versus the cutoff okay and off c10 so this is gonna change though so let's get a little trickier okay we do three bet these hands versus someone that has a tight pre-flop raise well obviously if they're not raising the accurate range from the cutoff you know you would tighten up your three-bedroom range and three bet more like you're facing a low jack race because they're tighter um how i do it is i just mix all my offset tents i three bet them all like 50 50. that's about the right frequency but most people here like this is a 12 3-bit most people on the button three bet like seven percent eight percent it's because they miss all these offset hands so that makes up a majority of the range so let's get a little trickier now okay and so now we're gonna say um we're going to say 60 big blinds because it makes it a little easier you're on the button facing a low jack raise what types of hands do you want to three bet okay you're facing a low jack raise what types of hands do you want to three bet how are you gonna figure that out a couple of step process here here's how my process goes first what uh what is bottom of lojack opening okay it's gonna be off suit tens and duded eights okay so a lot of my three bets are going to come from then suited nines which is right below their offsuit tens i don't want to block their tens it's gonna be suited nines and then like off suit broadways offsuit broadways are kinda always gonna be in there oh excuse me so offsuit nines or i would say obviously broadway suited nines is where a lot of my three bets come from okay so button versus lojack off seat broadways suited nines okay jack nine jack a as you get to like higher cards now when i say suited nines okay this is kind of a trick too that i remember like a lot of these like weaker suited like we don't three about ace nine suited and the reason is is like obviously an ace is a lot stronger so like we start to three about some of this weaker stuff but in general in general again it's kind of the weakest suited hands that are flattening or three betting you see some of these weaker suited hands and then these off suit broadway's just always three bet why not suited eights um now suited eights the reason you don't want a three bet suited eights and you see they're all pretty much out is because we're against a stronger opening range and therefore we need to have stronger hands to bluff with so that's why we don't want to three that you know 10 8 suited queen 8 suited very much because we're up against a stronger opening range and we want more equity when we get called so if we look versus under the gun we're not going to three bet you know 10 8 suited we're three betting a lot stronger suited hands now so the under the gun range is like mostly like offsuit jacks and stuff so you see we're three betting a lot he's king nine king eight queen nine like there are a lot stronger hands that we three bet so the the the stronger the range we're up against the more um yeah these bottom hands that we three better folds if we get four bit yep so you know i didn't want to get too much into this three bet versus call today um because there's something else i want to talk about so you don't want to three about low blockers so what i mean here is like we're facing the low jack okay so let's look at the lojax calling range so low jack it has to do with their response so versus versus three bet from the button so this is the low jacks response when we three better on the button what hands are folding off suit tens off suit jacks right so we're not gonna three bet any suited tents okay they're too strong at hands we don't want a three-bet a suited 10 because it's too strong here we're going to see that three bit like suited nines mostly and then we're gonna we're gonna three that like off suit jack's intense because these offsuit hands just always work into a three bet range and you can go back to the button chart and that's going to kind of be the case so what i want to talk to you now is how we can use these new rules we have for board coverage for post slot play so let's do something here let's do a hand report let's do um let's take off some tags i want to find a random hand here this wasn't planned but we're going to talk about this queen 10 off okay i raise pre-flop big blind calls we're gonna assume no icm no anything this is chip ev so we raise on the button big blind calls flop comes king six six okay how often do you want to see about this board how often do you want a continuation bet on this king 66 board okay every answer says everyone is almost everyone is saying 100 and i would say this board is a lot closer to like a 50 c bet i think you're checking here about 50 percent of the time and what colin said is exactly right okay how many offset sixes do we raise in our pre-flop range how many offsuit sixes do we raise in our pre-flop range zero so right away so now that we said zero most of you guys were saying this is a very high c-bet board okay most of you said there's a very high c but board so if we're not raising many offseason sixes how often do we really see about this board very often yeah so if i'm going to go here i'm going to go to uh gto trainer we'll just pull up this so we can look this is going to be a very heavy check plot the reason is is because we don't have any 6x coverage so we're going to look here uh 60 big blinds big blind versus button king six six [Music] okay so king six six rainbow a lot of you guys said this is like you would bet just here hear 100 you might be able to do against like a really weak player but we're just kind of talking in general here so you can already see here what's the big blind doing oh sorry what's the big blind strategy on this flop are they leading a lot or not they have a pretty big lead percentage what does that mean you should probably check a lot because they're supposed to lead but when they don't you know we're checking this board a lot so this is a 57 check on king six six and that's after the big blind lead 24 of the range um so this isn't even a 50 like we should probably be betting this board like 40 percent of the time if we assume they're not leading correctly and the reason is we don't have any of these off suit sixes okay king queen checking ace king checking checking a lot of these king axions that make sense now what happens when i change this board to king 88 what happens on king 88 what's our betting frequency on king88 okay give me a percentage what percentage of the time are we betting okay i see like 70 very good yeah we're betting a lot closer to a hundred percent there might be like 20 checking though on k8 what happens we have all the what's the bottom of the opening range on the button what's the bottom of the opening range on the button off due dates okay so guess what we have board coverage there so we get a bet so there will be no leading now from the big line on k8 why because we're on the button we have full nut advance so now there's zero leading from the big blind why because we have all the offset eights okay checking 25 of the time okay we're checking like some queens and jacks but in general lots of betting now okay now let's give another flop all right queen 76 rainbow so we'll do 40 big blinds button versus big blind uh okay button versus big blind on queen seven six rainbow i'm gonna minimize it first how often are we betting on queen seven six rainbow on the butt as the button thirty percent fifty five percent fifty percent thirty percent queen seven six rainbow we don't have any straights so i've seen answers from 25 to 80 so um you know this is like i thought most people were gonna say we bet a lot this is a board we like we check a decent amount but the reason we checked why do we check queen seven six a decent amount why can i tell you right away we're gonna have a pretty good checking range there's two reasons why i know we're gonna check a lot on this board no sevens and sixes okay so that's very good that's number one if you have cap locks on turn it off all right so number one reason i know we're going to check this board is we don't have many offseason sevens or offshoot sixes right everyone agree with that we need a lot of protection on this board yeah so queen seven six we don't know how many offshoot sevens and months sixes second question this is a little trickier what is the bottom of the big blind defending range what is the bottom of the big blind defending range offsuit sixes most people got it off suit sixes so what's going on here is the we don't have much coverage of second and third pair okay and the big blind has full coverage of second and third pair so and i can just tell you you can take my word for it like we're gonna have a queen about the big blind and the button are gonna have a queen about equal percentages of the time so if we have a queen about the same amount of time as the big blind okay and they have a seven and a six way more often than us because we don't raise all the sevens to sixes we're at a kind of like we still have a range advantage here but we don't want to bet all the time because we're just losing this seven and six war so you see here we're checking 46 percent of the time why because we don't have all these awesome sixes and we don't have all the offset sevens if i weight them like we're kind of missing most of these offset sevens but the big blind has every offset six in every offsuit seven so you guys see how i'm starting to put this together to learn post flop play so let's take it a step further okay so let's say it goes check big blind checks why do we have the range advantage because we raised like we have a much like we have all the top of the range we probably have like 55 equity on this sport so we're going to say we bet you know they check we bet you know like let's say we bet two thirds who cares on queen seven six that's not the point of this they call let's say the river card is the turn is the jack of hearts okay say that they check let's say we bet okay let's just say we bet whatever the big one calls and let's say the river is the ten of spades okay actually let's say the river is the uh they call i'm just making up a random example cause i don't care the river is the ace of clubs all right let's say the big blind checks i'm not going to show the imposition strategy the big blind checks okay as the imposition player uh and the employee position player shoves how do we know what ranges if any of our opponents are playing you don't but you got to make the best assumptions you can and like probably using these charts are a better assumption than whatever guesses you could think of okay so big blind checks uh big blind checks and all right so someone says it's a better run out for the button yeah of course it is the better run out for the button we got that part when the button shoves what are the worst cards for the big blind bluff catch wit what are the worst cards for the big blind bluff catch with on this run out they check big blind shoves what is the worst cards to have in your hand to what are the worst like ranking of card to have yeah whoever just said eights and nines let me ask demetrius why did you say eights and nines are the worst cards a couple other people said it too but i'm gonna ask demetrius because i have them so it's not because straight draws are blocked like so a lot of people are saying busted straight draws you know okay yeah but just think of it you're making it way too simple what's the bottom of the button opening range on queen 76 jack what's the bottom of the opening range [Music] like what is almost every single bluff from the button what cards do they have to contain so off two dates right okay every single bluff in the button is probably not every bluff but almost every bluff is either gonna contain an eight a nine or a ten okay so what would be a better hand to call with queen three or queen eight i don't know if either are gonna be a call i'm just saying what would be a better hand to call with queen three or queen eight okay good most of you are saying queen three why why would queen three be better than queen eight someone said don't block bluffs and where are the bluffs coming from i don't even know what this hand was i just made it up but where do the bluffs have to come from from the button the button has to block with bluff with off suit eights off so they're gonna block with eights first nine seconds tens third and then king's fourth potentially so they're gonna bluff with those ants because that's where they have to bluff from so when they check okay and we check when the small blind button goes all in okay here's queen eight pure fold here's queen three pure call why are we folding queen nine pure fold almost there's some blocker stuff here the queen nine's folding queen eight's folding but queen five off is calling queen three off queen deuce off so you guys see right away um let's look at another one um let's see here what's another hand you see king seven's folding why they might bluff with some king heis um here's queen yeah so the main thing right away i just noticed like i told you right away queen eight's gonna fold because why they have to bluff from eights nines and tens so we're folding all those hands and we call with queen three off because we don't block any bluffs when we have a three okay but i know that because i know what the bottom of the opening range is they bought with eight nines and sentences they can't bluff with a jack because that has a pair they can't bluff with the queens that has a pair it's hard to bluff with the king high like king tens of straight they can have king nine or king eight so again they have to have a king why do we fold queen five suit call with queen five off uh it's probably some type of blocker with suits it has to do with suits probably like you want to not have diamonds and clubs it looks like you want to bluff with spades and stuff but that's not really the point this is the point here okay threes are good deuces are good why is the five kind of bad why is the 5 kind of bad queen 5 off is mixing fold why yeah block suited fives that's only if you gotta read that they're bluffing because dude we are b i mean if you look like you don't have a like saying like you have to have a read they're bluffing isn't really like i don't that's not how i think about poker how i think about poker is like where do the bluffs have to come from but they're bluffing well if we look at the button shoving range um oh sorry uh so we bet they call and there was the ace of clubs on the turn [Music] and we check and we look at the bluffs i'm going to turn the weights off so we can actually see them where the boss come from 8x 9x 8x 9x can't believe a jacket can't belove kink queen 8 king 8 suited bluffing then suited 5's or also where they come from 9 five ten five king five king four ten four so it's a lot easier to figure out where the bluffs are coming from when you actually know the pre-flop ranges now let's change the river let's say the ace of clubs let's change it to a 10. so let's say you call and then the turn the river is the ten of spades okay and you check a shove like an ace is probably a pretty bad card to call with because a lot of the bluffs are going to come from an ace i would guess you know this is kind of screwed up this is how i did the ranges or something i don't know all right it was versus cut off the worst cards to bluff cash with would be a 9x or 10x since those are the bottom of their range correct i can't see who that sent so this is perfect so dieter asks dieter said if i understand it correct if it was versus cut off the worst cards to bluff catch would be a nine or a ten since those are the bottom of the offset range correct so now like calling with an eight would be good but calling with a nine would be bad so you got a 100 right theater that's why we fold queen five yeah because we block suited fives with the queen five so that's why threes and deuces are the best hands to call with okay all right so that's like a whole nother thing but i wanted to explain how i use this post flop i use the same rules to understand post flop and understand both bluff catching and knowing where i need to bluff from as a razor where the bottom of my range is and it's all very helpful and very useful and this is how kind of i think about poker a lot okay this is like a simplified version of how i think about poker so that's what i got for you today so you guys have a good week study pre-flop everyone study pre-flop for two hours this week that's your homework i want everyone to spend two hours studying pre-flop if you only have three hours to study poker this week i want you to spend all three hours studying pre-flop i don't care i like about playing post loft", metadata={'source': 'EC0nxNA4OHQ', 'title': 'PREFLOP Poker RANGES [How To STUDY & MEMORIZE Them]', 'description':

[Document(page_content="let's go ahead and get right to it when to float here's the question you never seem to know when you should float i presume junky draws are not equally good that is true any advice would be appreciated all right so what is floating to begin with this is when you call someone's bet on the flop usually with some sort of junky draw with the intention of improving to the best hand or picking up the pot with a bluff some portion of the time on the turn or river right and in order to very profitably float ideally you want your opponent to play straightforwardly on the turn because imagine someone raises you call on the button let's say they bet the flop you call with nothing on the turn they're always going to bet with their good hands and they're always going to check their marginal and bad hands if that's the case you can very often pick up the pot with a turn bet or a turn plus a river bet because when they check they have indicated they don't have a good hand right that is the ideal spot to be floating and this is why floating is so profitable against mostly small and medium stakes players who just play pretty straightforwardly right and even in the high stakes games a lot of people only or mostly bet the turn with a very polarized range in some scenarios which means when they check they have a marginal made hand or junk which is you know actually good poker but then what they do wrong is they overfold a little bit of that range on the turn and then they overfold a little bit of their turn calling range on the river and that's going to result in you winning the pot more than you should also floating from in position is way better than floating from out of position because just think about how it goes right we just discussed how it happens whenever you're in position right they check you have the opportunity to bet on the turn in the river but let's say you check call from out of position with a marginal hand and then you check the turn and they check behind well now if you bet the river if they have a marginal maid hand a bluff catcher of any sort they just have a really really easy call because the pot's not big you're not applying a whole lot of pressure and you know they have to face one bet whereas whenever you're in position they're gonna have to face two bets and it's way harder to call two bets than one bats also if you check call from out of position and you decide you're going to lead a lot well leading a lot on the turn is just usually not good poker to begin with so i mean that could be a fine strategy if you know your opponent will play really really weakly against leads but you typically don't just don't want to there's not a whole lot of spots to lead in general on the turn especially as you get deeper and deeper stacked and that's just not good poker right so you want to be ideally playing good poker does it also help if your opponent has a high continuation of that percentage on the flop yes because usually people continuation bet well if people continuation bet too often they will inevitably have too much junk on the turn which will result in them checking in and folding right essentially you want to find a spot where they are going to be too weak either because as mark says here they continuation bet the flop every time or too often so their range is just naturally weak or because their turn play indicates a relatively weak range these are things that make floating really really good and to some extent if you know your opponent's going to play super straightforwardly on the turn and you know their flop range just can't be all that good then you can float with all sorts of junk with the idea that they're going to play straightforwardly on the turn assuming you know that to be true about your opponent additional floating rules we can call these rules and quotation marks typically you're going to want to float way tighter in multi-way pots because someone's more likely to have something decent right also when someone bets on the flop into multiple players their range just has to be a little bit stronger and a little bit more polarized right so if the range is a little bit stronger and a little bit more polarized that's going to make their turn range naturally stronger also a lot of people realize they can't continuation bet the flop multi-way every time or even most of the time people have figured this out so for that reason you're not going to want to be doing a whole lot of floating in multi-way posts except for with like hands with pretty good equity that make logical sense turns out playing multi-way pots isn't all that difficult because usually you just continue with your good hands and that's good poker but if you do play against someone who let's say raises every time and then continuation bets every ace higher king high flop even if it's multi-way because that's just how they operate if you are last closing the action it's a still a reasonable spot to float because while they do have a lot of top pairs in the range they also have a lot of junk and if you call there and you know they're not going to continue barreling all that often unless they just have an ace or you know top pair then maybe those opportunities exist but in general you want to be floating way tighter in multi-way pots also you're going to want to float tighter as you face larger bets and that's because of a few things first you're getting worse implied odds with your gut shot draw or whatever you have and when people bet larger usually they have a more polarized range and usually more polarized ranges continue betting on the turn which is not good for you because you want your opponent to check a lot on the turn so the opposite of this is or the inverse of this whatever the right word is is that you want to be floating more as you're facing smaller bets because you're getting better pod odds and implied odds and usually as people bet smaller they're usually betting with just their entire range which will lead to their range on the turn being somewhat weak also you're gonna want to float tighter as stacks get shallower because again you're lacking implied odds and also your opponent can more easily stack off with clearly marginal hands like middle pair right like imagine someone raises you call on the button and they have ace jack on a queen jack three board in that scenario you probably can float with all sorts of gut shots and whatnot when you're playing 100 big blinds deep because you can put that ace jack in pretty bad shape on the turn in the river with a big turn in riverbed on queen jack three if they have ace jack or jack ten or what not right but if uh they're playing 20 big blinds deep they're just not going to fold it right so that's the scenario where as you get shallower and shallower you should usually float a little bit less because the marginal hands can more happily stack off so we know we're not gonna be doing much floating out at all from out of position our floats from out of position are just gonna be good hands is what it amounts to like good reasonable draws so from in position what are the best hands to float well they're usually going to be hands with decent equity and i'm just going to start from the top and go all the way to the bottom right we're going to call flush draws floats even though they're not really because those are like clearly decent hands um but like if you do call with a low flush draw on the flop you're calling it like nine high or whatever with the idea that you're gonna either make a flush and win when you make a flush or your opponent's gonna check and that's gonna give you a chance to bluff right so flush draws your hands that you're always gonna want to call or raise and from in position you're gonna find you wanna call a whole lot more often compared to when you're out of position when you're at a position with a draw that lacks showdown value assuming the stacks are not set up such that your opponents can just rip it in on the turn i'm sorry i'm sorry rip it in if you check raise the flop because you don't want to check raise like nine high flush run then get jammed on right if you're either shallow enough to where you can be the one check shoving all in or deep enough to where you can check raise and then still call a re-raise then you're going to be doing a lot of check raising with your draws out of position but from imposition you're going to be doing a whole lot of calling we discussed this thoroughly in the tournament master class where we show that from in position you just call a lot and flush draws are really really good hands to call with same thing with open-ended straight draws very clearly obvious hands gut shot straight draws now gut shot straight draws definitely vary in strength you're going to find that in general you want to float more often as your opponent's range is usually going to be a little bit weaker right so let's say you do have 10 9 9 8 9 8 on queen jack 3 same queen jack 3 board right if you're playing in a scenario where you have a gut shot 9 8 on queen drag 3 if you get a 10 you have a straight but if a 10 comes you could still easily be beat by ace king right and also your opponents have a whole lot of queens and a whole lot of jacks in the range that's the scenario where that gut shot straight draw is pretty bad right and it should probably just be folded to a bet even though you have some equity especially if you're facing a polarized bet but if you have a hand like nine eight on six five two where you get a seven you have a straight or a nine or eight now you have top pair that's the spot where you're way happier with your gut shot so gut shots with over cards are usually pretty good gut shots with one over card are usually pretty good assuming if you make that gut shot it's really unlikely your opponent has a straight you always have to be wary of hands like ace king ace queen king queen etc right you don't have to be so wary of hands like nine eight so over cards what got a gut shot or a got shot with one over card is usually pretty good the under cards are only reasonable when your opponent's ranges should be pretty weak next backdoor flush draws ideally back door flush draws with two over cards is pretty good in most scenarios backdoor flush draws the one over card is weaker backdoor flush draws with no over cards and no gut shot straight draw etc are usually pretty garbage so keep that in mind again they vary in strength like you would almost rather have a hand like two over cards than a backdoor flush draw with no over cards right next two over cards say you have um queen jack on 763 that's the spot where you can call the queen jack and if your opponent bets the turn you can just fold unless you improve and if they check the turn you can bluff and if they well if you improve to a queen or jack on the turn you have top pair and you're very happy right so two of our cards can sometimes be pretty good sometimes not also backdoor straight draws again these are a little bit weaker unless they have over cards included backdoor straight draw with no over cards is pretty terrible backdoor straight draw with two of our cards is pretty reasonable and you should usually not float with hands much weaker than these you should not be calling with stuff like king high very often unless there's an ace on the board right king hai is way better with an ace on the board than when there's not you should not be floating with stuff like just random random two under cards or one over card and a backdoor straight draw you should not be calling with garbage um it is worth noting like ace high sometimes counts as marginal made hand right so don't think that like i'm assuming all of these hands here have no showdown value all of it that's presumed here right all of these hands cannot win on their own merit if it checks down that is presumed if you have ace high that's not really a um it's not really like a float because ace high could very often be good um but yeah you don't want to be floating stuff like queen high or jack hi with just like stone nothing like say it comes ace king three and you have jack 8 suited right for a backdoor straight draw back door flush draw if your opponent bets you should probably just fold the jacket suited because it's a pretty terrible hand and it's very easy for you to be against an ace or a king right so so don't think you have to float with just like total garbage hands essentially anything that is in the bottom of any of these categories like gut shot straight draws the weakest ones are probably not very good weakest backdoor flush draws not very good weakest do-over cards and maybe this should be upgraded a little bit um weakest backwards straight draw is not very good so keep that in mind as essentially as your hand can improve in more ways you get to stick around a little bit wider but when you have total junk just fold it's okay to fold your junk you're supposed to fold your junk all right next let's go through some examples reasonable hands to float this is when someone raises you call in position doesn't really matter which position you're in but you're going to find usually you're calling on the button or the cutoff more often than the other scenarios ace seven six two spades jack ten of spades obviously straight draw or obviously flush draw king ten of hearts king high could be good it has a backdoor flush draw like you know pretty decent hand back door straight draw as well like this is reasonable nine eight open ended ten eight oh got shot obviously very good um what should we not be floating here queen four of hearts no backdoor flush draw well a bad backdoor flush draw also a weaker backdoor i'm sorry what am i friends a weaker backdoor straight draw to the four right um weaker backward flush draw which you know doesn't really matter all that much if you make a flush you're very happy but also queen high just doesn't win very often so this is a hand that's not particularly great um queen jack of clubs for just you know queen high not particularly great king two of diamonds king high could be good here but it's easy enough for the opponent to have pretty good equity and you're just not gonna be able to continue on the turn of the river ever if your opponent keeps betting so this is not good ideally if you take a look at all these hands that are floating there are a lot of turn-in river cards where they can still continue right whereas if you look at these hands that are not continuing there's just a lot of hands that are they just can't continue on turns very often at all like imagine you have queen jacket clubs and you turn a jack and your opponent keeps betting on 876 you don't really love it right all right 772 this is a spot where now you will have very few logical draws right as the board gets less and less coordinated essentially meaning it's just like kind of hard to have anything decent you have to get a little bit more loose with the terminology of what is a draw so what is a draw on ace on 772 well ace king is pretty good king queen of clubs for backdoor flush draw pretty good with two over cards it is worth noting on 772 the over card idea is actually not all that relevant you'd just rather have the higher ones because they're going to make top pair more often because in this scenario if the opponent has a seven we just lose and if they have a two notice like four three has the same number of outs as king queen right but if you turn a king or queen you're just never folding whereas if you have four three and you turn a four like i mean you still may end up folding to a turn plus riverbed um so you'd rather just have higher cards in general nine eight for two over cards to the seven that also have backwards straight draw again the two over cards the seven is not that relevant but you know back uh over cards plus backdoor straight draw is reasonable same thing with eight six four three of um dime four three of diamonds here would probably continue as well six five of diamonds would probably continue obviously any flush draw is going to continue king queen of diamonds would continue so backdoor flush draws would continue there as well i would not call it stuff like king queen of hearts though because you know it's just slightly weaker it has a little bit less equity six five no back door draws probably no good four three no back door draw is probably no good again as your opponent bet smaller like say about one big blind you should probably continue but if they bet three or four big blinds you should probably fold okay then what about oh one thing worth noting say it was instead seven two two seven two two now the idea of over cards the seven becomes way more uh relevant because on seven two two now if your opponent has a seven you'd much rather have an over card right because if you have nine eight on seven two two you if you have a nine eight and you get a nine you win right whereas on seven seven two if your opponent has a seven and you get a nine you still lose so over card to the pair on the board doesn't really matter overcard to the other card on the board the unpaired card is what is relevant all right what about queen ten seven all spades okay relevant floats here are gonna be stuff like pocket nines probably not good could be maybe but it has the spade um ace two with the ace of spades pretty great hand king jack of hearts for open-ended not a great hand but it's reasonable enough 9 8 for open-ended same thing jack age of spades uh this is obviously a flush this should be like jack of spades eight of clubs this is a gut shot with jack of spades pretty reasonable what should not be floated pocket twos with the two of spades pocket twos is almost never good here and when it is your opponent has loads of equity and if you get a spade that's also likely not good if you face any aggression the tough thing about the hand like the two of spades is that if you do improve to the flush and your opponent keeps betting on the turn and river you probably lose but they could be bluffing and if they check very often they're gonna have a marginal speed themselves that doesn't plan on bowling so when they keep betting you lose and when they check you lose right so it's just not quite as good of a hand ace of clubs two of spades you might rather have the ace of spades right instead of the two of spades same same story if you get the two of spades you're just not happy and jack gate of heart for just a gut shot also not a particularly great hand because if you make the gut shot and your opponent keeps betting i mean yeah you're happy enough but you'd just rather have the open-ended straight draws you have enough of those it's also worth noting like as you have more reasonable hands to continue like here you probably have a lot of hands with the ace of spades and the king of spades and the jack of spades you in turn do not continue with weaker and weaker and weaker junk right because you have enough hands that can reasonably continue whereas on a hand like a board like 772 with no flush draw let's say you probably need to be continuing with a lot of hands with over cards with backdoor straight draw whereas if there's a flush draw on board you continue perhaps a little bit less often with those all right what do we do when we are facing a turnback most players who bet the flop and the turn usually have a strong polarized range most players not all players but most players so you'll usually continue when you have decent equity and fold when you do not simple as that the nice thing about floating the flop with all the hands we listed here is that like i said you are going to turn some equity some portion of the time like either a straight draw or flush draw or what not or top pair so sometimes your trials are going to come in and sometimes they're not are we concerned with balance concerns with the range we are floating with i mean the thing is is you're like this is just gt good gto poker this is not even like exploitative strategy here where you're floating absurdly wide i just want to make sure people are not floating too infrequently most of the time people fold too often on every betting round and the hands that they incorrectly fold are usually some hands that they should be floating with that are kind of junky like like the queen four on six five two you know it's not great but it's good enough stuff like random over cards on 772 they have a backdoor flush draw a backboard straight draw those are good enough and a lot of people just do not continue so if anything most people have a problem with playing too tightly in these spots not too loosely um raising the turn bet after you float the flop is usually only ideal if your opponent's turn betting range is either too wide and is full of junk in which case it will fold very frequently to a raise or if your opponent's just betting with a polarized range but they're gonna be really really really tight when you do raise them some people will continue with a polarized range on the turn as they should like strong top pairs and better but then they'll fold out some of the top pairs to a turn race so if they fold out all their draws to a turn race and they fold out all their top pair marginal kickers or even top pair of kickers to a turn raise maybe maybe against those players raising is ideal but you need your opponent to be especially passive or you need to have them think that you are especially weak to the point that you essentially never bluff the turn right a lot of players if you are an older player you just have a really tight image in general you can get away with a lot of pretty absurd plays especially on the turn and river because most people are going to incorrectly presume that whenever you raise the turn you just have the nuts so if they think you have the nuts then you know you should be bluffing a lot um obviously call again when you turn additional equity with your chunky draws like we said that's either going to be a pear good draw etc and fold when you have junk fold when you have junk i cannot make it any more clear whenever you float the flop with some weak draw when the turn is not favorable for you and they keep betting fold don't get insane a lot of people get it in their heads that because they float the flop they must now try to run some insane bluff but it's just not true because you have to realize some of your draws are going to improve and some of them are not sometimes none of your draws improve sometimes just to turn as a awful card if you like an ace let's say if we go back over here let's try to find an example say it comes um six five two turn is the ace of diamonds right stone brick ace of diamonds for you uh we'll still continue with our flush draw and open we're going to fold out everything else right besides ace king of course everything else will just have to fold on the ace of diamonds some cards are just really really good for your opponent and some cards are gonna be really really good for you like say the turns a four or a three or an eight or a nine right those are all going to be pretty great cards for you so sometimes you're going to win the pod a lot on the turn sometimes you're not going to win the pot a lot on the turn if you go through the tournament master class in the turn section you'll see that some cards on specific boards will heavily favor one player over the other and whenever you get a bad turn it's okay you just fold right like say on king seven four that turns an ace that's a pretty awful turn for you so you're gonna end up folding a lot of the time right if the turn's an eight or a three or a five or a four or a seven right these are gonna be cards that are pretty great for you obviously your calling flop with your sevens and your fours as well right so those cards will be really good for you and that's gonna result in you winning the pot a lot sometimes you win a lot on the turn sometimes you do not and that is a okay when you are check two on the turn you should probably exploitatively bet with everything usually using a large polarized size assuming your opponent is we'll call them standard right if your opponent is going to bet most of their good hands on the turn and check most of their marginal hands and garbage on the turn most people are going to fold too often so exploitatively bet with everything using a bigger size because if you bet small they're just going to call with all their bluff catchers and their range is gonna be a lot of bluff catchers and garbage right now obviously some people are never gonna fold a bluff catcher if your opponent is never gonna fold a bluff catcher then clearly you should not be bluffing all that often maybe you shouldn't be floating all that often to begin with but you're gonna find that the vast majority of players especially in the small and medium stakes games bet the flop too often check the turn too often fold to a turn bet too often and fold to a river bet too often so against those players you should be exploitatively betting very very frequently been betting big because if they have a lot of marginal hands and garbage you want to apply a lot of pressure um generally betting with lots of decent well betting when a lot of draws arrive that make most decent pairs on the flop much weaker is ideal so say the flop comes 983 two spades and the turn is a jack right that's the spot where you have ten seven you have queen 10 you have the flush draws right you just have a lot of those hands and your opponent depending on where they raise from may not right so if they don't have very many of those hands and you have a lot of them and you know they'll bet all their flushes on the turn and all their straights on the turn and all their sets on the turn and all their two pairs on the turn that makes their range top pair and worse and while they could have some whatever the top pair card was jack i think i said while they could have some jacks if you blast a turn and blast the river they're going to be pretty unhappy and they usually don't have even the top pair they usually have something weaker than that that they're going to fold out now if there are three spades on the board your opponent is very likely to check call your turnback because they're gonna have a lot of hands with the acer king of spades right but they're gonna fold all those out on the river whenever they miss and when they do hit sometimes they're also just not going to like when they do hit they're also going to have some misses as well and like say say they do have ace jack no spade on a three spade turn and the river is a spade now they're always going to fold a strat to a riverbed or mostly full day's track to a riverbed right and when the river is a spade or when the river is not a spade they're going to fall out all the ace and king highs that call the turnback right so sometimes they fold sometimes they don't but whenever you're bluffing you usually only need to win the pot half the time a third of the time something like that and they're going to fold out 40 or 50 or 60 of the time usually they're unfolded out like 50 or 60 or 70 of the time if you do bet the turn you very likely want to continue bluffing on the river again because people overfold on the river you especially want to be betting when you unblock hands that they will always fold they will you they will usually have a hand like decent days highs decent draws so whenever you do not block those hands whenever you don't have a card with those cards in them they're more likely to have those cards right so if you're sitting there with like the nut low they're very likely to have stuff like ace high or a middle pair right so you want to think what am i trying to get my opponent to fold that's what you want to be considering what do i want to get them to fold and if you do not have a card in your hand that makes that less likely it means that they are naturally more likely to have that right and in those cases you should be bluffing like basically every time i'll tell you though in general i personally have made a lot of money doing this and everybody else i teach has made a lot of money doing this where you just drastically overbluff when your opponents take passive lines unless you know your opponent will almost always call the river when they call the turn some players when you bet big on the turn they are not folding they're just not doing it now obviously if as there are more draws available on the turn there should have a lot of busted draws on the river that they will obviously fold and if you're sitting there they're not low and they have queen high it would be criminal to let them see the river for free right or see the showdown for free so against those players on those rivers you should still be bluffing but say the board is kind of uncoordinated and the turn doesn't change much and the river doesn't change much you have to be way more cautious like say they raise early position you call on the button and it comes 873 okay they check i'm sorry they bet you float turn is a card like a three or a two eight seven three two right that's the spot where a lot of players will check call ace high on the turn and if the river is a blank there's always check calling ace high on the river and they probably don't have a whole lot of draws because they raise from early position so on that setup in that scenario you probably don't want to be bluffing the call happy players on the river because they're gonna have a lot of ace highs that just aren't folding or a lot of fans like pocket fives on eight seven three that bet the flop check call turn check call river other players though will just always fold a hand like pocket fives or ace high on the river there because they think when you bet the turn of the river you just must have the nuts and they think all right i'm gonna call the turn bet and then fold if they keep betting that's what their thought process is and against those players obviously you want to continue betting because they're going to fold out almost everything by the river so that's floating i realize there's there's a lot to it um but hopefully this gives you a good framework for how to approach these scenarios", metadata={'source': 'KxHMudA2DCM', 'title': 'When To FLOAT [Poker STRATEGY]', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 28162, 'thumbnail_url':

[Document(page_content="what we are going to do today is review some hands from my day one and day two a couple of day two hands um i didn't get home till late last night so um only a couple of the day twos but i got some good hands that have some good concepts i think that we can talk about today all right let's jump in um i didn't have time to run sims because these hands are all like 100 big blinds plus deep so it takes a while to run them so we'll be using auden because they already have 100 big blind sims uh not perfect but it will get the job done for us so um first hand we're going to jump into is actually i want to talk a little bit about the main event really quick because something i've noticed so and i was saying this before the tournament started and it seems like this year more than any year like everyone talks about like like so um i went to a breakfast poker coaching member's breakfast um earlier this week i can't remember what day a lot of members and stuff jonathan was there some of the coaches were there and stuff we had a breakfast like q a and stuff with some of the members and the most common question i got asked was what adjustments do i make for the main event i mean i don't make any adjustments i don't make any adjustments at all i just don't understand like you know that people are like oh it's you know you can't be risky in the main event it's such a good tournament you know it's all this you know you can't be risky you gotta play small ball you gotta do all this stuff like so you're telling me you're playing the super bowl the biggest term of the entire year and you're going to change your strategy that you played every other tournament for the highest tv tournament of the year does that make sense it's the the the the reason it's the best tournament is because your ev just gets magnified you get so much longer to just magnify your ev you get so many spots to just you know pick up those one big blind one big blind one big blind of ev spots like i don't i don't get the argument of you know yeah like the kansas city chiefs make the super bowl all right kansas city chiefs make the super bowl this year okay well maybe not this year because they suck last year okay kansas chiefs play the tampa bay buccaneers pat mahomes is their best player that's their whole offense you think there's they're going to go to the super bowl we're going to run the ball 70 of the time we're not going to throw the ball with patmo homes we're just gonna change our entire strategy does that make much sense i'm sorry if you're not a sports fan like it doesn't make much sense to change the strategy the other thing people are so scared to bust out of the main event it's one tournament is it an important tournament like yeah it's a cool tournament and stuff but like for my year it's less than five percent of the total buy-ins i'm gonna play for the whole year it's less than five percent you know i'll play probably somewhere between like a quarter million i mean in a normal year without the pandemic like quarter million in buy-ins like people just like lower their ev so much because they're trying to adjust their their pain to adjust their strategy what you're paying with is ev and that literally is what makes the main event so like good and like i've noticed it through the first two days where there's spots where i'm just getting two three four times the value like no one wants to bet big people aren't getting value with their good hands they're like checking behind with like six high and pots because they don't want to bluff off their chips and stuff so um yeah it's just um just food for thought you know and for you guys like maybe it's not the main event let's say you satellite into like a you know big online tournament or you satellite into a wpt tournament or a thousand dollar live tournament you know don't go in changing your strategy go in and play the game that you know and don't like just try to like be careful and survive like that's not how you make money in tournaments so all right um cool we're gonna start with this hand which isn't doesn't seem that exciting on the surface but i think this uh spot is one of the most important spots in poker so button makes it two and a half x uh anyone folding here pre-flop um i call uh 109.5 two clubs we check this parabet's 1 000. uh what do you guys think in here so how do we think about this well first off folding is not an option here that's number one um that's like you always want to start in spots with like eliminating one of the options if you can so i think folding is definitely versus the button not an option here that's number one so we got check race or check call so we gotta weigh the merits of those two options um obviously we have a gut shot we have a club if we didn't have a club check raise would not be an option here why is folding not an option well we're up against the button who's raising with h4 offsuit a6 off suit all this stuff we got a gut shot you know if we had a pair we have way too much equity to fold yes we have eight high but we have a lot of equity against the opponent's range they can have ace king you know base queen like it's a disaster to fold this hand getting calling 1000 to win 4 600 chips it's a disaster to fold this ham one a lot of times if we hit a pair of eights or a pair of sixes we win the hand let alone hit a seven or two clubs um we could bluff later so folding not an option too much interaction here if you're folding this flop you should just fold pre-flop can't fold and if we didn't have a club we would not check race now i would rather check raise if i hadn't over card to the tent why is that well when we check raise and we get called the player's pretty likely you know not all the time but it's going to have a 10 or a 9 a lot and so having a hand like jack 7 or queen 8 or king jack or or something with an over card to the 10 is going to be really really helpful because we have more equity against the 10 or nine and when we just like check call if they have ace four like they're going to fold that to the check ratio which is fine but we can call against ace four and we have plenty of outs anyways we have enough equity to just check call so um this isn't a pure check raise if you're pure check raising this um you're probably getting a little too out of line um i think check raising here is fine but i think colleen is definitely like pretty like reasonable option here as well for sure we can check more if this is rainbow also another consideration here is we're gonna check raise less here because we're a hundred big blinds deep versus if we were 30 big blinds deep we're gonna check raise a lot more why is that the case why do we check raise less here at 100 and more at 30. so it all has to do with our value value range there's nothing with preserving chips or anything that has to do with our value range if we have 30 big blinds deep we could check raise jack 10 here and just check raise and go all in with jack 10 here that'd be pretty reasonable uh at 100 big blinds we can't really we don't really want to check raise jack ted of diamonds here so um we're going to be a little more like two pair set heavy like ace 10 maybe king time with a club you know queen 10 of diamonds we're probably not check raising here always at 100 big blinds deep so if we have less value hands we can we have to have less bluffs okay so always start with what's your value range here and like our value range here like we don't have nines pre-flop we don't have tens pre-flop you know we have fives 10-5 suited 9-5 suited we don't have ten five off we have we have ten nine ace ten we king ten like that's our value range we don't have jack screens kings aces um i call if you wanna check grace some of the time that's fine i don't think you should be check grazing all the time but check raise is fine too i'd probably make it like i don't know 4 500 something like that ace of clubs um check check interesting spot here so let's analyze the turn so the button checks back uh button's a little bit on the tighter side so how are we starting to arrange the button here uh when they check back here on the ace of clubs so a lot of people are saying the button is capped um so like to a good degree i would say they're fully capped like but they're they're getting there like they probably don't have a flush right they probably don't have a flush probably don't have a set like that's pretty like safe to assume they're probably gonna have a pair of tons a lot pair of nines a lot maybe like jax queens kings without a club a lot um although those hands maybe could still bet um you know pocket sixes sevens eights pair nines um probably not a flush and probably not like ace jack ace queen or ace king maybe they have like ace eight a seven a six ace four eight three ace dudes i think some of the weaker aces are reasonable to check back if they don't have a club i think that makes some sense um how does the ace interact with us when we because we check our entire range how does the ace interact with us on the turn so like we're going to check call with like 10x 9x 5x um we're going to check all some ace highs for sure now the ace of clubs on the board like we have like having like ace jack we didn't three bet we have ace 8 with the eight of clubs a7 with the seven of clubs asexual hearts we'll have some asex for sure not a ton but we have some aces um decent amount of flushes too that don't check race so we're gonna have some flushes as well um so once like i cut off you know once this player checks back obviously we're gonna have some flushes so it's always important in these spots like this is my favorite spot in poker these button big blind spots where it goes back call check check so it's always important i think to set up the river in your head before like the river card even comes out and as you get really good at this you'll be able to do this in like you know two seconds it just takes a lot of practice nine of hearts okay so how does the nine change things so this is like probably one of the more difficult spots in poker to play because there's a lot of things going on a lot of things going on here and so this becomes like a pretty like difficult spot to play well it's a easy spot to play poorly let's put it that way but it's a tough spot to play really well but there's a way you can organize your thinking here that will help you play this spot better we have a couple of hand examples today um we'll we'll do the next hand i'll do which is kind of out of order is like a very similar spot to this so um all right so the first thing we want to think about here is how the river changed things okay so the nine of hearts is not a blank okay it's not a deuce not three it's not a four this is definitely this is far from a blank okay number one is the button does the button improve on the nine yeah so the button's gonna like very reasonably the button could have a hand like king nine queen nine jack nine you know nine eight off suit some suited nines so the button council nines we have a lot of nines though too because we check call a lot of nines too so both of us improve the trips a lot right i think that's easy to understand both players can have trips here okay now we got to think about our value range on this river so let's just walk through like the different hand uh like different like hand classes that we have so let's start with um top of the range all right so let's say uh flushes okay flushes in full houses so we could have um i think it's reas um like we could have ace nine here for sure okay ace nine's a very i am very easily we could have uh our opponent can't have ace nine either probably um maybe we have nine five every once in a while but probably not often we probably check raise that mostly but like we have 89 for a full house and then we have a lot of flushes right and not really many full houses so what's like the goal when we have a full house or flush here like what's our goal this is like the kind of easy way to start to think about it not just extract value it's to get a lot of chips in the pot yeah we want to play like a big pot like maybe we don't want to get all in with the flush for sure like we probably don't want to get in 90k chips here because we probably would run into like aces or something a lot here or ace nine but like you know we don't want to get in like pot we want to get in you know multiples of the pot or something okay um next category i would say would be like a pair of aces okay so let's say we have like ace eight with the eight of clubs or something you know we have a pair of aces a decent amount right not a ton but we have some pair of aces do we want a value bet with those aces do we want to check you know what what's kind of our what do we want to do with like a pair of aces here is 10x strong enough to value bet probably not on a nine if it wasn't a nine like for sure 10x cabet to get called by 9x but it gets pretty hard to get value some from the 10 here but um i didn't think it was gonna be that unreasonable okay so that's like kind of one before you even think about bluffing you wanna think about your value range and kind of what you're trying to accomplish here okay so let me so let's now let's go to the next step okay the next step here is so that's like our really good hands like flushes and full houses when we bet really big so let's say we bet like pot size or bigger okay what hands are called what like what are we getting called by so let's say we bet like we have seven six of clubs let's say we bet six thousand here what hand is gonna what like what's the opponent's like most likely hands are gonna call with a nine awesome cool maybe an ace yeah so a nine's gonna call a lot when we bet six thousand like that's the hand that's gonna call us a lot and then some aces like ace six a7 you know ace with a club or something like that perfect awesome good we have a full house kind of same thing um when we have an ace what's the most likely hand to call us you know we're probably gonna bet smaller with an ace maybe we bet like two thousand three thousand something like that probably like a ten right perfect and and so like this is kind of how we're working through this process yeah we need him to call with worse a sex but it's kind of like he can't really call us with a worse ace here because we don't have ace jack maybe we do i guess we could have ace jack with the jack of clubs like that's the only ace we can have that can get a value bet in here like i'm not saying we don't bet a7 but he can't call us with the worst ace because he we chop if we have a worse face than that okay so i want to go back to these flushes hands okay so we say if we if we have like seven six of clubs we want to get a lot of money in this pot right if we bet big we bet like 6 000. she's probably gonna call us with a nine or an ace right what happens if we check with a flush what hands will the button value bet if we have a flush here let's say again we have the seven six of clubs what hands are gonna value bet if we check a nine is gonna value that he's gonna value about an i and maybe he value that some of his aces maybe not if he's really tight but you know he might value he'll probably value that like ace jack or something if you check that back maybe he'll value bet i don't know ace eight but people are pretty tight but he's gonna value better nine all right so if he calls us with a nine if we have a flush and he bets a nine if we check what should we do with a lot of our flushes we should check and why should we check raise we should check raise because the calling range is the same as his value betting range now they're not exactly the same but he's not going to raise with a 9 if we bet 4 600. he's not going to raise but if we check now he bets like 3 000 with a nine let's say say he has king nine he bets three thousand now we make it fifteen 000. now we can get 3x to pot in on the river you see how this works plus maybe he bluffs on the river maybe he bluffs as well so whatever like the calling range is equal to their betting range um that's like big voice now let's change it let's change the situation now let's say instead of the nine of hearts it was the deuce of hearts okay change this river card this is the deuce of hearts now instead of the nine of hearts how does that change things with our flushes when we bet big he's probably gonna call us with an ace you know a ten sometimes you know maybe like pocket jacks with a club he's gonna value bet way less when we check now with our flushes he's gonna check back a lot because he doesn't have like he didn't improve to a lot of value bets on the river so like the nine is like that's the key thing here is like the nine gives this player a lot of value bets on the river and so um that's like the key part of this river um with playing our really big hands here so that's kind of like i think we talked about like the flushes and full houses here now what about if we have a nine ourselves how should we play our hand here if we have like king nine or queen nine or jack nine or any nine for example should we have a check should we always bet how should like what type of sizing should we use it's when the calling range is equal to the betting range we are better off check raising if i'm going to add a statement if our hand is strong enough to check raise so now if we have a 9 here let's say we have nine eight is nine eight strong enough to check raise the river here for value i would say no because we're gonna run into like jack nine queen nine king nine way too much here do we have any bluffs if we check raise here uh if we're playing like like in theory yes depends on um i probably wouldn't check raise bluff here much um the reason i probably wouldn't check raise bluff here a ton here against weaker players is because what's their value betting range when we bet it's a nine are they going to fold of like dude like people think this is kind of important for like live poker playing against weaker players um people like to think about their hands in terms of the absolute value of their hand rather relative to the um relative value of their hand so like when they bet here with a nine three of a kind is a really really good hand right and i don't like to make people fold really really good hands i like to check raise bluff river i check ray's bluff here when i think the player is going to make thin value bets you want to check raise rivers when they're value betting thin most weak players don't value that thin if your opponent is not shut betting this river with say a7 then you shouldn't really check raise that like that much because their range is pretty polarized it's like a nine and i'm not really in the game of trying to make people fold trips i'm trying to i'm in the game of trying to make people fold second pair third pair you know a pair of tens like here that's like how i think about that okay so if we have a 9 we want to bet always why well we want to get called by an ace if we check an ace is going to check back sometimes especially against like these weak passive players they're probably going to check back at ac or a lot that's a disaster so we probably want to bet pot something like that i don't know somewhere around like pot maybe even if you want to get greedy against like a sticky player that's never going to fold an ace you go a little bit bigger but that makes a lot of sense if we have a 9 we probably want to bet pretty big reason we always bet with a 9 is because we can't check raise it okay and if we check if we check what's this player gonna bet with they don't really value that much like they could have a nine but we have one of the nines and like they're gonna check back with an ace a lot so like i don't trust this player to value about nice enough for me so like i'm gonna do the betting myself because it's a disaster when this player checks back and ice and they probably don't bluff enough so there's not a lot of value in like also too like if we check raise here they're probably not calling with an ace right so like there's not a lot of value in like check raising a nine here very often because we block what hands are gonna call us what they're gonna call us with is a nine here and we have a nine in our hand okay now we have this hand eight a spades six of clubs um we have eight high can't win the pop bluffing seems fine what type of sizing should we use here then well when we bet here on the river we have like some small bets with a pair of aces so like we're gonna bet small like half pot maybe 2 000 with some aces and we have some really big bets with a nine right now what nines are most likely for the button to have how is the button most likely to have a nine here always always always start with offsuit hands there's more combinations of offsuit hands so how is the button more likely to have a nine they're gonna have king nine offsuit queen nine offsuit jack ninofsu they don't really have ten nine offsuit maybe but probably not nine eight off suit likely but some people fold nine in offsuit on the button because they're really tight but like they don't fold k9 so and then like the weaker nines they're gonna have are gonna be suited nines so like for them to have a nine that's not jack nine or better it's gonna be like nine seven suited nine six suited nine four suited if they're crazy so with the lower cards remember when we bet big here what are we getting called by an ace or a nine right so um i've looked at the sim already because i was studying the sand from day one so i'm kind of like this isn't everything i was thinking about in game a lot of it was but like i've i learned some things already on this sip um mostly that we're supposed to check all out of our flushes here i wasn't checking my flushes here in-game um but here in terms of bluffing what cards are more relevant here or how is our eight and a six relevant here what's the relevance so when we're bluffing we wanna block calls and unblock folds so how does our eight six stack up kind of there so we block nine eight off suit i think that's important yep so like there's two really key hands that we block here as well blocking like ace eight and a6 are also pretty relevant here right ace eight and a6 a6 probably are not folding but in terms of like for our really big bet bluffs what cards are best to bet really big with them given what we just talked about this is like a really really really complicated high level spot and like this is one of the more important spots in nolan to hold him i think so we're not really concerned about blocking flushes like a little bit but he probably doesn't have a flush anyways so hands with like a king a queen or a jacket are probably pretty good for bluffing pretty big all right because the button to have a nine it's probably gonna be king nine queen nine or jack nine so having like a king queen or a jack is pretty good for your big bets because you block the most combinations of 9x and this 86 may be as good for like a smallish bet because you block more of the asex hands so um all right let's instead of me rambling let's go to the sim and just kind of look here and see if we can piece together some of these ideas oh we have to wait the 20 seconds all right give it 20 seconds here so let's just actually take a look here at the buttons range so if you look here here's the buttons range so here's their off suit nines they have ace nine king nine queen nine jack nine ten nine and then um you know they can have those off see here's nine eight zero nine seven nine six nine five suited they don't have hands like you know nines here's nine seven off nine eight off they don't have nine six off they don't have nine five nine four you know they don't have the worst offset nines so that nine of clubs we check button plays you know we're not going to look at too much of the strategy they do check sometimes like 20 percent they do check a lot they have all these off suit aces they miss they have all these off suit kings that miss so it's kind of a hard board to bet their entire range uh they bet small like 33 and here's the eight six off so you just see if we don't have a club we never check raise if we have a club we can sometimes check race pretty simple you know 50 50 if you want to check raise here like check race is fine definitely fine um it's a big check race too if you look here like they made it two big blinds the actual preferred size in the check race here is ten big blinds ten bigs so really really really big check race when we do check race okay here's ace ten not even a pure check race here mostly check raising but not pure um here's king tun check raising a lot more when you have the king of clubs here's queen 10 really only check raising when you have the queen of clubs jack 10 sometimes um queen 10 mostly just doing it with a backdoor flush draw so like if you notice here we only check raise like you know 15 if we were shorter um we'd check raise a lot more okay all right here's nine five ten nine fives et cetera so we call ace of clubs we check and let's just take a look here at our opponent's strategy so let's look here so like here's ace king from our opponent they bet that ace queen ace jack they're betting that here's ace ten they're betting ace nine ace eight e7 like they're betting they check back with an ace sometimes like especially the weaker ones like ace five a6 a7 yo they check back with some of those here's like kings queens and jacks they're supposed to bet most people probably don't here's pair nines king nine queen nine jack nine nine eight suited nine seven what do they check back with mostly a pair of nines something pair of tens probably a lot people probably don't bet king ten queen ten jack ten here ten eight here enough um pretty cool that you can still bet like a hand like jack 10 off suit here so even on the flush completer you can still bet quite a bit using two sizes here small size big size um we can look here here's flushes if you look pretty much always betty couple of flushes that check but pretty much always betting with their flushes so we're gonna go check check and get to the the meat of this problem and then the river is the nine of hearts okay so we got let's say we have two sizings here really there's a massive like this sizing which is kind of stupid i've told you guys about it's one thing i don't like about this program but it works really well for what we're trying to do here with big bang so we have like two sizings here let's say we have like a 33 which is the block like a 75 bet you know i'd probably use like a pot size bet and then like there's this big over bet that's we'll just ignore that so let's look at the 33 here so what hands are we betting small with here's ace jack here's ace ten ace eight a seven ace eight a seven a six so when it's full here that means we always do it with this hand so a six of diamonds we always just bet 33 here sometimes we bet small with a nine here as well so you see here like nine eight sometimes bets small nine seven sometimes but small nine six sometimes but small okay sometimes we bet small and then we have some bluffs like king four diamonds we just bet small with it king three king queen four queen deuce you know sometimes we just bet small okay what about the big bet 75 pot well do you guys see the difference here what are we big with a nine king nine queen nine jack nine jack nine queen nine king nine you know we got big with the nine good and what do we do with our flushes well we check a lot we check a lot with our flushes why well let's take a look here if we bet 75 percent of the pie what is our opponent call with well they call with a6 they call it ace five they call it queen nine they call it jack nine they call it nine eight they call it nine seven they call with a pair of aces they even fold they say pretty cool uh they call sometimes with a pair of tens but most of their calling range is a pair of aces trip nines right you guys see that here what if we check let's go back say it's the nine of hearts still now if we check what's their betting range what are they with ace eight they check what are they bet with they bet with a nine the betting the the the betting range is almost the same as the the the calling range it's pretty much like yeah they have a couple flushes here but now they bet say that they bet two thirds here they bet seven big blinds do we play it safe we got seven high flush draw what do we do we have a seven high flush draw what do we do we don't call we raise they bet seven big blinds we make it 44 big blinds i'm gonna make it huge here we go there's all these are all flushes flush flush flush flush flush flush flush full house full house flush what do we check raise bluff with here here's ten eight with the eight of clubs you're ten seven with the seven of clubs sometimes ten six with the six of club sometimes queen of clubs five king of clubs five five four like pear and a flush blocker or something yeah so this is how you get a lot of money in the pot this is how you get like 30 40 big blinds in this pot on the river okay now let's look at a different river instead of the nine of hearts let's say it's the deuce of hearts now what are we gonna do with our flushes we already talked about this before and i haven't looked at this but i'm assuming we're gonna mostly bet with our flushes now we're gonna check sometimes maybe we check like 15 of the time 20 percent of the time but now we're mostly going to bet why because they're not going to bet if we check yeah they'll bend and ace but it's not like they're not going to bet call with an ace anyways like some of our flushes are still checking but like we're betting a lot more with our flashes gears king eye flush queen eye flush queen eye jack high flush yeah we check sometimes with a flush still we still check sometimes but let's like also too like we're betting like massive sometimes like this is 30 big blinds or something we're betting here this is like some really big bets when we check now when we check now on on the on this sure like what are they value bet like here's a nine checks but like here's the problem with checking a flush in this spot all right how many people do you think bet queen of diamonds 10 of spades here on the river it's like the solver checks here with a flush a lot but yeah every 10 they're supposed to value about 10 3 like they're they're they're supposed to value that with 10-3 they're supposed to value bet with every single 10 every single ace like people check back ace 3 here a lot the the charcoal gray means it's not that it's a hand they don't have if like here like gray means they don't have that hand this is like a weighted average of how often they have that hand so like it's a disaster like people just don't value that thin enough here to incentivize us because like here they bet now we like weigh into them you see here like now we're just shoving we just shoved for 95 big bonds now because they're capped they didn't improve on the deuce of hearts so now like our flushes just go ape [\xa0__\xa0] it's kind of funny we just shove for 100 big blinds they call 17 of the time they fold a lot yes but they still have to call sometimes they still have to call sometimes with an ace why because most of their range is an ace there's not really a way around it no they bet king king jack jack on the turn so that's the problem with checking on this river is because people don't value that thin enough and that makes it really tough for us to um go for a check raise so let's look at one or two more things and then uh we'll just look at one more hand that's this very similar spot and then maybe we'll go through a couple hands quickly um so in terms of bluffing so if you look here we're actually checking like 74 of the time here on this river we actually check a lot and the reason is is like we don't really really want a value bet an acer 9. we're not value betting any of our 10x here and so we don't really get a bluff a ton because of that and if you see here where do we want to bluff the most here like here's queen jack wants to bluff a lot here's king hai's that actually want to bluff a lot with king heis because we block 9x with these king highs and queen highs and stuff there's some blocker stuff going on here um i have eight six here it's kind of weird like it it checks a lot i wouldn't have checked eight high here but um i'll just show you what happened in game i bet 4 600 what do you guys do on the river here with 10x so we've got 75 percent and here's tedx mostly folds even with a club like jack 10 with the club he's 10 6 the weaker ones call why do these ones call why does 10 5 10 4 10 3 call sorry not 10 5. why do we call it 10 4 and 10 3 we pull 10 8 10 7 10 6. because we bluff with an 876 jack queen king so like you gotta think about like the um where the bluffs are coming from well they're probably gonna come from like a queen a jack a seven or an eight something like that so that's why these threes are really really good four is fives so that's why ace eight folds even here a lot look at this ace queen just folds ace queen of diamonds how many of you are folding ace queen of diamonds on the river here i'm not zero percent chance i folded that on the river but this just shows you in terms of like you need to stop thinking about the absolute value of your hand and think about the relative when we bet large here we're betting 75 of the pot ace queen is a bluff catcher our range is like 9x essentially and like the queen is pretty bad blocking some of the river bluffs so king five calls before why because we don't bluff that much with king high we bought some but it also blocks like nine five and some stuff so again not an exciting hand not a big pot but a really important kind of river spot okay this is from yesterday type passive player i haven't seen the sim for this one yet so i'll tell you what i'm thinking here in game and then uh you guys so i had studied this hand the night before this eight six hand i studied the night before so that's kind of like comes in here all right recall nothing exciting there king queen five check check adjust the clubs flush comes in um maybe against like an aggressive player i think maybe it makes a little sense to check turn because like a lot of their calling range on the turn is like a queen and we have a queen but i'm betting i bet 5 000 in a 6800 because of like if there wasn't a flush card i bet a lot bigger but because it's the flush card he calls river's the queen of hearts okay what are we thinking here on the river so very similar spot so how do we work through this what's our like what's our value range on the river here well we're gonna have some king x that bets the turn so let's go back to the turn we're gonna check here a decent amount like maybe we have like king jack with the jack of clubs king 10 with the ten of clubs like we'll have a little bit of king x but not much um because like a lot of mechanics is probably gonna check the turn again on the flush card okay but i have some king x for sure but we're gonna have flushes for sure um we're definitely gonna have some flushes um we don't really have a lot of queens right we don't really bet 5000 on the turn with the queen all right obviously what's our goal with this here we want to get a lot of money into the pot right if we let big let's say pot right let's just say if we bet pot here what's his calling range that's people flushes like reasonable this guy could have a flush maybe you know he's tight passive his calling range is like flushes queen x some people are saying king x um if he has a king he's probably not folding it but i don't think he has a king very often because he probably just bets the flop with the king right what's more likely what's more likely here when he checks back he has a king or he has a queen he has a queen more often right yeah he's gonna have a queen more often so when he when we when we bet big he calls us with a queen and he might just call with like seven six of clubs if we bet pot he probably just calls with the flush unless it's like the nut flush right what happens if we check what do you do with ace queen on the river what does he do with queen jack on the river what do you do with flushes on the river he bets the same hands that are going to call a big bet anyways right so what should we do here with queen five check race i checked he checked back he had like pocket sevens with the seven of clubs cool maybe i could have bet four thousand yippee i don't wanna win four i'm not here to win four 000 chips with queen 5. i'm here to win 60 000 chips with queen 5. i'm happy to forgo 4 000 chips you know ten times for when i just get a check raise when he bets twelve thousand i'm gonna make it fifty thousand and then he has trips tripp is a really good hand he has a flush do you think he's ever folded a flush on this river no do you think he's folding ace queen probably not especially if he has the ace of clubs he's never folding so um i haven't looked this up so let's take a look here and see now what would we do here if we had king jack sometimes he bluffs sometimes so some people are saying why not bet 2k the reason i own that 2k is because i don't trust this player to raise her the queen some people are like a lot of too many people just call here with queen 10 if i bet like 3 000 chips and that's a disaster too so so we're like king jack i bet small i try to target pocket eights pocket sevens those types of hands what if he had a queen with a queen i'd bet small sometimes and then i'd bet like medium to largest like twelve thousand ten thousand something like that to target like king x pocket jacks type hands so let's take a look here really quick uh button cutoff hijack low jack big blind single raised pot uh board is king five king five queen yeah i don't go for the bet three bet very much because people with value because people don't raise enough so i don't think it's that worthwhile it's great with your medium straight fans yeah i mean i i wouldn't be surprised if this villain had a flush here like makes some sense to check back with like seven six of clubs on the flop or something i don't think it's unreasonable they probably should just bet range but people don't we check you see you're like they're supposed to always bet they don't that's fine it's gonna make the sim a little bit weird but if you see here like there's some like non-zero checks here with flushes and stuff for sure like it's kind of gonna be a weird sim because they check back so they don't like check much but it will work out here turn deuce of clubs yeah you rolled a small number so we check a lot here here's queen five we mostly bet um you know here's like some we we bluff i'm not gonna look like spend too much time here here's a king we bet small so we've got like five big blinds here perfect they got our bet size here he calls rivers the queen of hearts please check queen five damn it i guess we're not getting enough value bets i don't know let's see here any full houses here that check here's pocket fives all right similar hand here pocket fives checking um so with fives it's kind of nice because we unblock the queen right we unblock the queen so make it more likely as a queen here's uh what's another one pocket deuces we check a lot with deuces um here's like king x so we got small with like king jack king 10 king nine uh the really big bets come from like flushes so like i would do this with nine four clubs i don't feel comfortable check raising nine four clubs here yeah it's like 33 150 this is kind of stupid like these sizings but like when we check here like you see here there's not a lot of fl like there's some flushes here for sure and there's some queen x here so like as we put more queen x in the range here and we put more flushes in the range here checking becomes very very very viable like i'm fine with my answer to like check the queen five here i think it's a reasonable answer and i think we're thinking about it correctly as you see you're like we have two bet sizes king x wants to bet small like queen seven wants to bet you know this is a flush so i think the the thinking works out here i think we're fine with the answer the sim is a little weird especially two because we're not really in solver land because he checked the flop i think he's gonna have a queen here a lot and i think check raise makes a lot of sense here on this river yeah the only thing is your queen is blocking him to have a queen for sure so like he's probably gonna check back with a king mostly which kind of sucks like when we check here we check like they're checking back king 10 k9 so that's maybe part of it here is that they check back a lot of the king x here and that's they don't have i guess that many queens because like queen jack off queen 10 off they don't have a lot of suit they have a king way more often which makes that's i guess part of the reason here um is that they're just not going to have enough depends how often they check back flush draws if this player was like the button or the cutoff they're gonna have a lot more queen x yeah that's why they prefer deuce deuce and five five to check raise 100 because it makes the queen available the value bet available so that was kind of a you know but the the the way to think about it though i think is still um relevant for sure all right we got like 10 minutes or something let's look at some fun hands all right look at this one uh actually no i want to look at this one we open jax this is on day one loose spazzy player three bets from the big blind what do you guys want to hear with jax call good what's our four bet range look like probably aces kings ace king suited i would flat here with ace king suited a lot um and then like some weaker suited aces like ace eight suited and stuff let's take a look at the pre-flop ranges cop 10.95 rainbow 4 500. what do we do fold call raise if we raise what size do we raise i prefer call i think raising is good in solver land the problem what's the problem with raising though in this type of situation i don't know how often even this loose spazzy player is gonna find the three that bluffs with ace 10 off you know 10 8 suited jack 10 suited and so like those are the hands we're trying to get value from so like sure raising is i think reasonable but it gets a little dicey i think all right we call king of clubs he bets 11 000. he's 21 000 back what do we do here we got a pair and a gut shot right can't fold right you can't fold a pair in a gutter right beautiful zero percent call why am i folding who's the king a better card for so we call the flop right what's our range for calling the flop we call with ace 10 king 10 queen 10 jack 10 suited queen jack king jack king queen pocket tens pocket nines pocky fives i'm not raising with my sets ten nine suited we call it pocket queens yeah okay how does the king interact with our range forget the big blinds range forget the big ones range for a second how does the king interact with our calling range on the flop it's a pretty good card for us why is it a good card for us because our weakest calls which are gonna be like king jack king queen like ace king suited ace queen suited like like a lot of our hands improved and it's clubs we're going to have ace jacker clubs these queen of clubs 10x of clubs like we have a lot of hands jack 10 improved queen 10 improved jack nine suited improved queen nine suited improved like really really really good card for us player probably shouldn't be betting all that often think about some for sure this player also is going to have like king queen this player's not fooling king queen if i do anything here fearful do you think the solver pure folds or do i just fold because it's you know people own three bet enough from the big boy yeah we'll look at the ranges really quick raise oh here's the big blind three betting range so it's like tens jacks queens kings aces ace queen suited some king queen suited some of the suited aces look at that where the where did the bluffs come from look at where the bluffs come from here right in here how does that connect with this slot pretty damn good it's a really good flop for the three better okay three bet here's our four betting range aces sometimes kings i get ace king you call a lot four of that a little bit of these suited aces you don't perform that much notice here you can still fold some of these suited connectors and small pairs even mix folds sometimes so button big blankets a range bet okay keep that in mind like why does a big bargain arrangement well where do they bluff them jack ten suited jack knights here ten nine zero queen jack queen ten their bluffs all connect when your bluffs connect that's when you get a bet range so they bet like he's got that pretty big like two-thirds yeah he bet like five into seven or like 45 so that's pretty big here yeah jack sometimes just shove jacks and queens sometimes you're just like yolo i'm all in not really my thing but you know it's kind of a thing so like yeah raising's a thing but i don't know i'm not sure if i'm all behind i don't trust my i don't trust my opponent to be bluffing enough pre-flop to be yolo shoving jacks so i call not much else to do king of clubs look how respectful now the strategy is they check 60 but what do they bet with mostly aces he's king queens and jacks mostly checks sometimes they bet you know king queen bets they bluff some so they bet pretty big again boom pierfold you don't fold jack 10 though because you have a pair get extra outs now you shove all in with like these these hands now like he doesn't have much behind sizing was a little different in game maybe it was it was a little smaller sizing in game but like just full days queen you fold you know all the stuff you call with the hands that are really good like queen jack and that's and stuff so pure fold don't be afraid to fold any other cool hands this kind of fun one i'm not going to go in depth of this i just call it jax this player calls big bond calls we're playing super deep this guy was pretty good i checked 6 3 deuce rainbow i think betting's fine but i think checking is also fine this is not really a good flop for my flatting range and these two players can just have the nuts this guy piles i'm already pretty scared here what would you guys do here if under the gun check called what would you do with jax i'd probably fold if under the gun called here i probably just fold like this range calling 5200 here is pretty strong this bets pretty damn strong ace check check nine what do you do now do you want to check call bluff catch against a loose passive fish these are not the type of players you want to bluff catch against check fold is better than check call here but we could bet for value cause he's gonna have like tens and eights and sevens a pair of sixes oh he's lose passive he's probably just gonna call us we've got five thousand i'm folding 100 of the time for a raise here if he raises me on the river here it's pocket nines like always or like five four so he called i won like probably eights or something stop check calling against loose passive fish that don't bluff you want to make more money in poker that's how you make more money you don't check call against loose passive fish like i wasn't even happy calling the flop but like i can't fold flop because he's just gonna blast with like pocket eights on the flop even though it's probably not good this is a three bet pre-flop what do you guys do pre-flop does anyone fold here pre-flop uh versus like two and a half x um i wouldn't hate if someone folded here i think folding is not the worst option um and um i think call is fine as well um i think um three bet i'll show you the so these charts are based off of 2.5 x so hijack low jack three bet 100 not a three-bet pre-flop home race hmm that three-bet i'm colorblind i can't tell 200 big blind effective change it sure this would uh probably fold more at 200 big blinds to be completely honest it's already folding like 40 of the time at 100 big blinds it probably is gonna fold more at 200 big ones like but these guys are all like a bunch of tight players behind me yeah we were like 200 effective for sure but definitely not three betting like this stuff there's no chance that gets in there we got four players left to act but these players were all really tight i'd probably call i'd probably never fold here i i i didn't i mixed for like a 50 3 but whenever you're in like not the cutoff or the button every hand is going to mix some three bets why because look you're three betting nine percent calling five like you three bet like two thirds of your hands and call a third of your hands because you don't want to go multi-way out of position you want to play heads up you're even three betting like sixes sometimes sevens eights nines ten nine suited like every single hand other than deuces and threes mixed three bet that's why people like don't three bet enough like in the main i i've been opening so wide because no one three bets literally i've been three bet like twice in three in two full days and 20 hours of live poker i've been three bet literally two or three times and i'm not exaggerating that's pathetic because it's the main event you got to play small ball you got to just call with pocket queens and see a flop i mean it wouldn't change much if i played day one f all the days are soft everyone you know so um yeah we three bet with that calls got a pot control right got a pot control right no we bet big go for value bad call by this guy call me with ace queen off on the flop pure folds ace queen off here pier folding on the flop is have a good one good luck", metadata={'source': 'ewT8pHQczVU', 'title': 'WSOP MAIN EVENT [A Study Guide]', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 6243, 'thumbnail_url':

[Document(page_content="today I'm extremely excited to present to you a video from pokercoaching.com and World Series of Poker bracelet winner Justin just GTO celiba this video delves into advanced tournament strategy and gives you a sneak peek into how the very best players in the world both study and play very specific situations he's going to go through three key hands that he recently played and touched on Game Theory optimal Concepts that can be applied to hundreds of situations that you will inevitably face at the poker table I hope you learn a ton I hope you enjoy the video let's get right to it hey what's up everybody this is Justin Saliba for pokercoaching.com we're going to be going through part two of my high stakes past solver hand history review if you missed part one I'd recommend going back and checking out that video we're gonna be doing new hands today but we're gonna build on a lot of the same like Concepts and fundamentals that we talked about from part one uh so once again we're gonna be going through a few hands and the goal isn't so much to make sure we played these spots well or teach you guys to play these two or three spots but we mostly want to try to extrapolate on some of the things that we're going to be seeing in the solver through these two or three examples that way you guys can extrapolate it and use it in a lot of different spots that you see in your games so let's get right into it this first hand comes from a recent 15K Arya up in King Jaco utg one the button calls and we see the Flop heads up eight five Deuce two-tone so I wanted to show this hand because playing out of position is the as the prefab razor is just a really difficult spot to play in general flops turns and rivers when we're playing versus big blind defends or in position versus even small blind defense those ranges are much wider at Cold call ranges and so developing simple flop strategies is typically pretty easy but when we're out of position here versus a button caller equities are going to run really close the button didn't call here with um you know Queen three suited and Ace six off suit right the the button's gonna have like a pretty strong range that connects as well with most boards that we do and so uh out of position equities are going to run close leading to much more polish strategies much more tracking in general so let's see this first decision point in the solver and check out the equities and strategies so in this spot we have 51 Equity out of position which obviously is is not a huge Equity advantage and then all 10 high and lower boards I would just recommend playing a check and big bet strategy you can see here that you're only using bet 16 pot it doesn't really make sense to use small bets we're not pushing an equity advantage on on boards that aren't the absolute best for us when we're out of position so first concept you're going to see when you raise that up position and you're facing a cold caller you need to be doing a lot of checking another concept you're going to see in this spot is how your over pairs play one note is that with 30 big blinds deep here so when you're 80 big blinds deep you know you know like a super deep spr is it's going to lead to overall uh checking frequency being higher because we're looking to check raise a lot more because when you bet two-thirds pot at a 12 to 1 spr you're still playing infinitely deep out of position and so the deeper you are the more checking you're going to be doing instead of betting but at 30 BBS you're going to be doing a reasonable amount of big betting and then if we look at this trend from nines to Aces this is going to be really common nine and tens need a lot of protection there's a lot of turns that you the equities are going to change on that you're not going to be able to continue barreling a lot uh or also you're not that happy playing Trek track you're not as happy playing Track Shack with tens as you are with say Aces and so that's why you're seeing nines betting at a really high frequency and then Ace is checking at a really high frequency and that's going to be common on a lot of Boards out of position as well the second and another concept rather that I want to talk about is the concept of matching if we approach the spot as okay I raised out of position or I raised somebody called as an imposition called caller now I'm out of position needing to play flop tones and rivers when you think about the value hands that want to bet here which is going to be like really heavy good eights and nines through Queens King a S8 Knights of Queens when you're looking to at which Bluffs you should pull you typically want to match your value hands so if nines and tens want to bet at a really high clip it's going to mean that 10 9 suited is going to want to bet a really high clip too it's kind of like matching the value hands with this region here there's a lot of reasons for that one that when hands need a lot of protection typically they're counterparts of 10 high benefit a lot by folding out higher higher cards so that concept of protection kind of works both ways with Bluffs and value and so that's what we're seeing here so I think that you can utilize that on a lot of spots oop especially 10 high and lower boards we're going to be doing a ton of tracking it's just it's just not a great not a great board for you so in this spot I check on the flop and the opponent checks back and now we can figure out how we should approach this turn so we know we're going to be doing a lot of checking on the flop and so when it goes check check one good rule of thumb is that the more checking we do on the flop when it goes check check the bigger our nut Advantage is going to be on the turn right because imagine if we played pure check on the Flop and we tracked every single hand in our range when it goes check check all of a sudden we have full frequency over over pairs uh on bricks and so as our overall checking frequency is higher we get to be more polar on the turn so in this spot we're doing a lot of checking with Aces some with King some with queens and then a lower frequency but still sum with nines through uh Jacks but the opponent in position is going to be betting a lot of those hands so when they bet they're good eights and they're over pairs at a high frequency when it goes check check they kind of say hey I have a marginal range but we can still say is that a position prefab razor well I have over pairs so I'm going to be using extremely polar sizings because if we look at this in the solver we're going to find is that here's the imposition betting range the betting a lot of their eights a lot of their over pairs when it goes to check Jack and a brick comes we don't even have a like bigger Equity advantage in the spot 51.3 right so equities kind of remain the same but now we have a bigger nut advantage we do have just like more ASI King High still and more air in our range but all of a sudden we can really polarize our range around their marginal hands and so that's why we see when it goes check check in these op spots we're just going to be over budding the turn of it at a really high clip I wouldn't even I wouldn't try to implement any small batch in this spot I would just play a really heavy check strategy again and then over betting and potting um should both be used so this is about 150 pot and this is about 100 pot and now we really see it it's like a very similar Trend with our with our over pairs nines is now betting it pure frequency tens high frequency Kings more checking A's more checking the same factor about uh protection as we saw on the Flop is being implemented on the turn same with our Bluffs here and so one thing we talked about in video one that we're going to see again is like high EV Rivers allowing us to Bluff certain hands and so when there's two Spades in the Flop and then we get a brick on the turn like the two of Hearts you're gonna see these off suit Kings only betting when they have a spade in them and that's going to be that's gonna be two two things one high UV rivers that allow us to Bluff more and two we're just blocking more continues right when we have the King of Spades they can't have King Nine of Spades that checks backflop and then cause a big bout in the turn so in this spot after check check we want to be really really polar push our nut Advantage still do a lot of checking and then we want to draw hands that are just logical right our over pairs want to put a lot of money in we want to match our over pairs the 10 9 Jack 9 Jack 10 type stuff and then we draw from our best uh offshoot bluffing candidates like the king Jaco with the Spade so so in this spot I have the King of Spades I go ahead and I bet 150 pot in the spot in the opponent calls we get the very very welcomed King of Clubs on the river and we have to think about how how good of a card is this for for our range and if we think about what kind of strategy we use on the turn we had nines through Queens a really high clip and then our our Spades didn't improve but our King High Bluffs just made top pair and so we're bluffing with a lot of this a lot of King high but the opponents almost never caught in King High especially when we have the camp Spades so we we really just like have the nuts in the spot and then the king is really really good for our range so I think we have a really really easy shove here on the river let's look at this in the solver so we bet 150 they have to just fold a ton right and and it's they're going to be really uncomfortable too I think this is really good in game check check and all of a sudden you bet 150 they're not happy with 10 8 suited you know they're not happy with their age they're not happy with seven sixes fours threes and I think that that is going to make up a lot of their range when it goes check check because people really do have a tendency just like bet total air that wants to get forwards right away and then bet their value at a uh that they're happy stacking off with so I'd be really surprised to see somebody check back Jacks at almost any frequency in the spot in game so we bet 150 call and we get the off suit King I think it was a club King of Clubs and as you can see we're just all in with almost our entire range because the king is just so good for us all of these King highs just made top pair and then nines through Queens are still worth and all then bet here which is awesome so we're really just doing a little bit of tracking with our Miss Spades which makes sense we talked about like bad River bluffing candidates in the last video and this is kind of the same thing that's happening where when we over bet Ace 10 of Spades trying to make their pocket fours and threes indifferent on the turn all of a sudden when we Jam River one portion of the range that they're Auto folding are going to be their Ace Hive Spades and so we don't we really don't love having these Spades in our hand on the river so even though the king is so good for us we can't always like we can't just Bluff everything here so we're checking our absolute worst bluffing candidates and then we're pretty much saying all them with the rest of our range so I hope this helps and then the spot he called uh he had pocket sevens pretty tough spot in the river um if we look at that in the solver it does make a sound just purely indifferent he's supposed to call with the Spade because I'm going to be bluffing Spades Less on the river than other cards so um I don't remember if he had a spade or not but yeah hopefully that helps you play these oop spots a little better um and then how to approach turns after track check uh let's go on to the next hand so in this next hand it comes from the same tournament the 15K Arya I opened the cutoff with King Nine off suit and the big blind defense I chose this hand because I think it is a good example of a spot where it's valuable to use multiple flatbed sizes I think a lot of people just look down in bed small with their entire range on this flop and I I do think that's a mistake when you're in late position on Jack and queen High middling boards we have a lot of hands and a large portion of our range that wants to be putting a lot of money in the pot right away and we also want to develop checks right there's going to be some hands the pocket tens the ace 10 suited they just make a lot of sense to put into a checking range because we don't have this massive Equity Advantage the big blind does have more two pair combos than us they connect reasonably well with the board so I think it's a good example of when we want to be betting big uh using mortal bet sizes and as well as checking so I want to spend some time on this flop strategy and in this hand I bet uh pot on the Flop and the opponent calls so let's look at this in the solver so we see that we're using a good amount of pot sized bets and then we're using a good amount of bet 25. once again I wouldn't worry about the small frequency Fringe sizes I would just break it up into two sizes and then checks and then let's think about what hands want to be putting a lot of money in the pot right away uh the first tenant comes to mind is like pocket Queens Pike Queens is a great hand that we don't get to Barrel on every turn in river right it's not like it's uh pocket Jacks where it's just gonna it's very likely to stay the knots we need protection with our hand and we want to get a lot of value right away other hands that seem and we're on blocking top pair other hands that seem reasonable for this it's going to be the ace track King Jack so this is gonna be really common Jack High Queen High boards they're connected like this your over pair to the top pair in your best top pair when you're using multiple bet sizes are going to very frequently fall into your big bet size and and that's due to protection right so we see ACE check off suit really really heavy just potted and then Ace Jack suited what we're going to see is that when we have clubs we're potting but we have the other ones it's more likely to use a smaller bet size and that's because we have the back door flush draw with the diamonds and the Spades and so that hand gets to Barrel more turns and rivers than the clubs and so clubs want to put more money in the pot right away other hands that make sense to to be using a big bet size when we're splitting our range if we keep thinking about that uh the idea that okay these are gonna be hands that want to get a lot of protection and value right away that don't get to Bear a lot of turns and rivers well A6 Falls perfectly into that right it's a hand knit we want to get a lot of value out of way we're not going to get to Barrel um a ton of turns and rivers and we don't really mind protection we don't mind them having to fold the eight nine off suit type stuff and then just getting a lot of value from their sixes and their fives another hand that's going to fall into that is like pocket sevens right it's our pocket pair between the top and the middle pair that needs the most protection and it wants the most value right away so when we're splitting our range that's that's kind of how I would approach it those are those are the first hand types that come to mind um and then the ones that fall into the small BET right it's like the pocket Jacks we're blocking their top pair we don't need very much protection it's the pocket stick pocket sixes and fives we just don't need as much protection our marginal hands that want to bet for a little bit thinner value the king six Queen six type stuff uh two pair same thing all these hands make sense to be betting into a smaller size and then our checks are pretty obvious pocket tens is a pocket pair that doesn't need very much protection um Ace 10 as well it's just a hand that we play Chuck Chuck really well we don't want to get Chuck raised um uh one other thing about being Chuck raised in the board type like this it's pretty interesting is that people you'll hear people say big blind players don't check raise enough here so I'm going to bet small but that really doesn't make sense with certain portions of our range right when we have Queens it's a nightmare for us if we bet 25 percent pot and they don't raise King Jack right they don't raise Jack 10 we're just losing a lot of value so if you're going to split your range I would really recommend to look to use big bet sizes with the hands that make sense even if you're like okay I want to Bluff for the small size because I think it's I think it's more profitable um in most games that's that's going to be totally fine if you're trying to play really strong and balanced you're going to draw your Bluffs from your matching hands once again like we talk about matching multiple times now but queens and kings want to use the big bet size so king queen back to flush draw is going to be hand that pots a lot right King I know has backed up straight drop possibilities and an over card of the Jack it's going to make sense to use the big bet size Ace 2 through ACE 4 King 2 through King four we we just get to we make them fold uh better ace high right away a lot of those hands make sense to be bluffing for for the big size so that's the first decision point I hope that's clear on how we want to break our range and why we are gaining more EV by using multiple bet sizes so I go with the pot size bet and the opponent calls let's see a turn so we get the jack of diamonds um this is a fun one I think that I think the one thing that I see a lot of people talk about is when they Bluff they Bluff good spots to Bluff instead of thinking about how does this hand fit into my overall strategy right when there's a queen on the turn let's just look at it when there's a queen back to a flush draw on the turn it's a really good bluffing card it's very clear that the queen is so good for the position player and really bad for the big blind so people tend to over Bluff that card rather than thinking about oh it's hard to over Bluff because the Queen's so good at YouTube at range but um and then the when the Jack pairs it's like oh man like that's not a good bluffing card but that doesn't mean you don't Bluff right you still need to find Bluffs so on the jack of diamonds it's so good for the opponent that I mean they just have way more jackets they do get to lead for about 10 every once in a while nobody really does it but we still need to find Bluffs in the spot because we do still have good jackass so if we think about where we want to pull our Bluffs from having the diamond is really nice um if we look at King and I know when we have the nine of diamonds we're pure betting 60 pot on the turn and that's because we're blocking continues one continually comes to my eyes like the six nine of diamonds when we bet 180 they're going to have the six nine of diamonds um at a high frequency and so I think like blocking that continue is relevant we also have an overcard to two over cards the 6X which is nice uh whereas like King four on the turn the four is not so good anymore because when we go for check check we just lose way more often than we go nine check check so we're drawing a lot of our Bluffs from blocking some of their jackets Jack nine off suit is is a good one here and then also having reasonable blockers the diamonds and more showed on value when it goes when we pair up and it goes track check so in this spot I do choose the BET 60 size and the player calls and then we get the ace of diamonds on the river and it's a pretty tricky spot now um I'll just give it away a little bit I end up checking I think hopefully by now after going through you know part one and and the hands you've covered already we realized that like the nine of diamonds is a good card to have when we're approaching River bluffing we want to unblock Auto folds and block potential calls this hand does an okay job about it I don't love our King I think our King doesn't really block any value their King Jack will likely raise flop and we're blocking the King with the pair like the off suit King six off suit King five which will almost certainly fold so I remember thinking that like I didn't love having a king but my nine of diamonds is so good obviously so we don't need to spend too much time on it I had some like mix and game that I don't remember if I was doing it 50 50 I was bluffing or third episode I was bluffing a rough but I end up checking back uh and I lost a jack eight let's look at this in the solver and then talk a little bit more about how I think that we can approach approach a spot so it goes Check bet 60 call Ace of Diamonds check so you're going to see King 90. with the King of Diamonds as always bluffing and then with the nine of diamonds it's bluffing it a mixed frequency and that is going to be because these off suit and King five I yeah King five and King six make up a reasonable amount of folds on the river as far as these off suit sixes here so we're and we are blocking this piece of a combo of nine six of diamonds and a little bit of the eight nine of diamonds that oh no Ace nine Diamond doesn't get here uh so we're blocking a little bit of the nine six and then we're blocking their folds so that causes the mix but I think in general in these spots I I don't really care too much about the bluffing frequency in the river it's a very uh it's a very arbitrary spot hopefully we got across the on the Flop mixing the BET size is really nice and then on the turn even though the card is you know a scary card to be bluffing on we just need to think about how our overall strategy wants to play and and how our uh how to build a robust turn Barrel strategy here one thing that I think does happen in game that I would recommend to keep in mind is that when you start potting on the flop I think that people are even top players in the world are just over folding a decent amount on flop and turn here so when we use this bet 60 size on the turn after potting the flop I just really don't think people appear continuing 6x like I just don't yeah I don't think people here are calling enough here and so if in game you have a really good idea of what you're targeting to fold you know you have to keep your heart rate down think think through the spot and try to understand okay what am I targeting here on the river you're not trying to make a jackfold a good player is not going to photojack on this River so you're really targeting their offsuit 6X and in spots like this when you pot and then barrel turn if you think and in my mind best players in the world are overboarding the spot so like weaker and tighter players are going to be folding by a massive margin so then all of a sudden your bluff on the river becomes insanely bad because a huge portion of their folds are just they over afford a turn and when people overfold flop and overfold turn there's a reason why you get caught in the river when you Bluff at a correct frequency at a GTO frequency right so I would definitely keep that in mind um on the river because yeah when we go all in we're targeting off we're targeting 6x in reality I think that if somebody gets here with a proper range it's gonna be really hard to look down at King 6-0 and call here I think it's gonna be impossible um but it doesn't really matter if they're just overfolding that hand type on on previous streets so I hope this was a good example of mostly the Flop strategy and a little bit on the turn and then on the river just make sure you're thinking thinking proper Concepts and choosing proper candidates so yeah I like that hand I lost it but it was a it was a fun one um let's go to one more so this hand was from actually the day prior uh in the 8K and I think it's another spot that people must play that's the show I chose it so um I opened Jack and I know on the button small blind calls and we get King 10-3 so if you want to take a second think about how often you think our overall range wants to bet here I just like put a number in your mind because I think myself and in general the population see about this spot insanely too much and the bottom line is uh I looked through his hand a bit earlier let's see here's the Flop frequency you're doing 71 tracks and the bottom is you're opening infinite on the button right you're opening 55 of hands and the opponent is calling way less right 15 and so you do have a top-end equity Advantage you know you have more Ace King you have more pocket tens good good King X Etc but you also have infinite more air so your overall Equity isn't super high in the spot and so you need to check back a ton uh and then when you bet you typically want to be using a medium to large bet size I would never small back this board um I would just do a little bit about 60 and then mostly checking and so we have a Jack nine Jack and I know at the club it makes total sense to have a nice solid mix here with this hand but this was the first part of this so I wanted to show you because like small blind versus and cut off or I'm sorry button for small blind cut off for small blind spots you just need to keep in mind that this small button cold call range is really really tight and when you open in late position you have a ton of air so if you start betting everything you're going to get just run over by a good player um because they just they connect pretty well with the board they have way less air for you to Target so uh yeah first decision point understand they need to check a lot in this hand I mix I go with the best 60 on the flop the opponent calls we get three of clubs so hopefully you can Implement that for a late position for a small blind we've got 60 call we get the three of Clubs the opponent checks and now we need to figure out if we want to Barrel or not so we have a lot of flushes here right we have all these ace high flushes um we definitely have more flushes than the opponent we get to bed at a reasonable frequency the board pairs so we now have more boats than the opponent too uh yeah way more 3x 10-3 pocket tens Etc so we do get to bet a reasonable frequency here and then when we think about our Bluffs Jack and I know with the club from everything we've talked about it's going to be through the same line right High V uh rivers that we get to Bluff on we have Equity to Barrel um we're blocking continues Etc so one interesting thing here is that the nine of clubs doesn't Barrel let's try to figure out why that is we bet 132 why don't we want to have the nine of Clubs hmm I actually don't think it's about the nine of clubs it's more about the off suit non-club Jack there we go so when we have the non-club Jack we're blocking their Queen Jack Ace Jack folds um so yeah it's not it's not about that we don't want the night of clubs it's that we really want to have the track of clubs because we're blocking a lot more that continues from the opponent Jackson of clubs right they have to just afford Jack 10 no Club so yeah that's kind of a uh a fun one to find in this I probably wouldn't have thought about that in game I would have probably just mixed Jack and I know with the nine of clubs too but um yeah I mean you we can always be better so this is it's a good one to learn um so yeah I bet for this exercise the opponent calls again and then we get the seven of diamonds so I made a little bit of a mistake in this spot and I essentially go all in the opponent calls it's gonna be hard to win this one so it was a good one to run good one to look over but let's look at it in the solver and see how a frequency should operate so on the river I thought that our hand would Bluff at a higher frequency um then what we're seeing here and I thought we blocked flushes we matched our value Etc but this tough thing about this small blind range is that if we think about the folds in the river when we Jam in the spot not all of a sudden those Jack of clubs ten they continued uh on the turn are now going to Bluff catch Rivers so we really don't love having the Jack clubs in our hand uh on the river we're also blocking the King Nine fold so yeah this spot's tricky I would I over Bluff this spot for sure in game um but it's the same Concepts right we're just trying to solve this puzzle of how does my hand interact with the opponent's fold how does my hand interact with the opponent's cause Etc so I was a little bit off in the spot and I bluffed a little bit too much um which isn't the end of the world but I hope that this one was a good example of uh when to check back a lot on the Flop how to approach barreling turn we found the fun concept with the nine clubs um and in the same kind of river logic that we've been talking about all these previous hands one thing to use in game that I did that is super valuable even though it seems silly is that I left one big blind bag um so I figured I'd take a minute and just talk talk through that so obviously if your opponents in your games think that oh he or she left one big blind back they can't have the nuts so I'm gonna call more obviously you shouldn't uh you know you shouldn't use that strategy when you're bluffing but I know that this opponent is is not thinking that I'm doing that they're going to know that I'm properly balanced with the spot and I'm always going to leave one big blend back and the issue not not the issue the the benefit of doing that is that in a big blind any format you're gonna get the cut when you lose the spot you're getting the cut off with one big blind so instead of being out of the tournament you're still in the tournament and have profitable decisions to be made in future streets so um yeah I did that here and I spun this up I ended up losing a flip for like 25 BBS 20 minutes later so it's kind of a Fun Spot in game they actually tanked with uh I like this guy a lot too he uh but he did tank with the king 10-0 and and it's a tough spot I have a lot of flushes here and if especially if I'm betting too much on the Flop I end up having a lot of flushes and boats in the river so um yeah I'm over bluffing this spot but or I did over Bluff the spot in this one instance so I'll definitely improve that but hopefully you guys can use those three hands and a lot of Concepts that we talked about too uh just improve in a lot of spots that you find in your games I hope this has been really helpful uh looking forward to part three thanks everybody bye", metadata={'source': 'adhmkr8F8ic', 'title': 'SECRETS From A Poker

[Document(page_content="all right so let's talk about some cash game hand reading upgrades i am coach brad wilson and gonna review some of last month's webinar before we dive in nobody mind my crazy uh mouse moving around that's just who i am right so cash game hand reading upgrades so before we dive into all of the slides what do you stand to gain this is uh an appropriate place to start why are you here what are you going to gain from this webinar first of all a higher win rate right you're going to win more money by upgrading your language and your ability to hand read and take exploitative actions versus vulnerable ranges you're going to gain the ability to make more frequent organic exploits and a process for considering post flop variables and what they mean in them we're also going to dive into some lessons from mda which is mass data analysis mass data analysis is basically looking at millions and millions of hands segmenting that data looking at how specific villain archetypes react in specific post-flop situations so it's the difference between what people actually do and what people theoretically ought to be doing like you learn in piyo so pretty big distinction there from mass data and you know theoretical piyo stuff if y'all don't remember last month's webinar descriptive post-flop language review poker language started out by this silly little prospector here that probably had three teeth and very dirty human beings spent all their time trying to dig for gold this is the language that we're working with bets calls and raises we're improving we're getting more specific in how we discuss poker strategy how we describe situations and then how we think about situations right like if we can think about situations more specifically then the actions were incentivized to take become a lot more obvious and it you know that's going to reduce complexity which is ultimately you know one of the goals we want to reduce complexity we want to have simple strategies that are extremely powerful so tight bets versus loose bets and i've made little graphs here uh not the greatest looking graphs but this is the range construction of a tight bet versus a loose bet i'm not going to be covering checks and folds matthew today just going to be covering the bets the calls the raises so tight bets versus loose bets so a tight bet has more value-driven initiative right they have their hands are stronger on average and they have less bluff driven initiatives so they're betting with value way more frequently and then the loose bet is the loose bet is way more bluff driven initiative and way more value-driven initiative billy makes a loose bet that means they have more bluff driven initiative than value driven initiative and vice versa this is just when you're playing a hand and you're describing the type of bet that you are facing from villain or your perception of the type of bet now we have tight call versus loose calls so you can see on the left we have a tight call we have equity realization driven so open-end straight draws flush draws trying to realize some equity uh value driven you can see large percentage 32 percent uh value in a tight calls range and then bluff catch driven 26 and then float driven call much smaller so tight calls have less float driven uh you know float driven characteristics bluff catch driven calls um attacking our loose betting our loose initiative value driven calls and equity realization calls and then a loose call here obviously going to be floating way more often right so 40 percent float driven they're calling because they think they can bluff us on a future street the value quadrate goes down the bluff catching quadrant remains about the same and then the equity realization goes down as well so tight call versus loose call construction here in some pi charts these are just generalized pie charts to give you a visualization of the range composition of a tite called the range composition of a loose call tight raised loose rays again driven by initiative you can see here that it's the same as the tight bets and the loose bets they are both initiative um so tight raise more value driven to bluff driven loose rays more bluff driven than value driven pretty intuitive stuff and now i want to talk about some variables that determine your language right these variables are not in any specific order or hierarchy as they are constructed in this slide deck so the first variable is going to be pre-flop formation so how tight is the pre-flop formation right like typically the looser the pre-flop formation the more hand combinations villain has post flop villain archetypes so villains the different type of villains that you face will take different actions i think this is pretty clear right like a recreational player is going to play different than a reg and a passive recreational player is going to play different than a volatile recreational player bet sizes are a very important variable that determine the language you use to describe the action villain is taking board texture also a very important variable villain specific data points this is historical information that you have if you're profiling your opponents this will be hands you've witnessed villain play in a specific way the reason i use the word formation is this is basically an over you know it's it's the eagle-eyed view of the situation so under the gun open is going to be typically a tight formation right it when you don't have a lot of data points to base what villains range is going to be this is like a shortcut so some villains are going to you know they're going to have a looser formation than when they open under the gun than other villains this is just a generalization of when i open under the gun and utg plus one or middle position three bets us you know that's a tight formation so we're just kind of using these words to describe the makeup of villains range post flop so just kind of a shortcut right we just say type formation instead of you know mp3 betting versus utg range so pre-flop formation post-flop language describes villains post-flop frequencies so when we say that a bet is a tight bet that does not mean you know it doesn't it isn't necessarily correlated to the overall size of their range right so like even if they get to the flop with a tight formation they can still be making loose bets um depending on different variables so type formation does not automatically mean a tight post flop range construction my example here middle position opens 2.5 x cut off three bets to 7.5 x and middle position calls so that is a tight formation preflop uh meaning narrow range that three bets uh from the cutoff versus mp and then mp's continuing range here is going to be fairly tight as well because they're out of position they're not incentivized to flat a wide range so this is a tight formation pre-flop however post flop the cutoff can still make loose or tight bets on different board textures so if the flop is say king seven deuce rainbow we can make an assumption that the cut off is going to bet their entire range here which means that it is a loose construction whereas on a board like six seven nine five six nine uh nine seven five those type of boards are going to be tighter bets when villain opts to continuation bet because there's less incentive to bet your entire range less incentive to have a lot of bluff driven initiative i do want to talk about this so potential failure point hazy ideas of pre-flop range construction equals your doom i know that it sounds very basic to spend time energy and effort into understanding pre-flop ranges constructing accurate pre-flop ranges however if you haven't spent focus energy on memorizing or understanding pre-flop grids you're going to struggle mightily using correct descriptive post-flop language like you're just if it's hazy if you don't have anything to base an assumption on you're just going to struggle with how villain is constructing their range so one variable to consider villain archetype so regs passive wrecks and volatile wrecks these are generalized descriptions obviously but necessary to talk about you're going to be describing regs um differently than passive wrecks and then volatile rex you're going to be describing them differently as well and i'm going to get into you know kind of a few of the differences between the villain archetypes that you'll be facing first is the reg right we have our little ninja they're going to be more balanced early in the decision tree it's likely they've spent energy understanding pre-flop grids they have a good understanding of three bet um you know balancing their three bets with bluffs and value they're also going to find and execute exploits quickly so they're going to be able to deviate they're going to be smart they're going to think on their feet and you know they're they're just going to yeah they're going to they're gonna be trickier to battle against that's just the nature of playing uh a person that's thinking at a higher level um they're exploitable and understudied understudied spots deeper in the decision tree deeper in the decision tree can be the turn and the river matthew but it can also be you know bed three betting on flops right if that's a scenario that you know that's a scenario i know is understudied as it relates to regs because people don't bet three bet often enough on flops and so they just haven't taken the time or energy to really dive deeply into what that range really looks like so sometimes it could be on the turn and river but then sometimes it could just be you know a bet three bet on the flop or you know facing a raise on the flop and then leading on the turn when they're out of position basically just areas that that are don't happen at a high frequency that are somewhat vague uh when you're not as studied in those spots you're not able to navigate them as intuitively as you are when you've studied you're prepared when you face the same situation over and over and over and over again um is bet three but when you bet get race and then re-raised correct then we have the passive wreck here as described by this little teddy bear passive racks tend to be predictable their bets tend to be hand incentive driven so not to say that passive wrecks don't bluff passive wrecks actually bluff more than you would think they do they just have too many combinations of hands they play way too many hands they call they have too many loose calls on flops they make it to rivers with where they're unimproved more often just by the nature of them having more combos that they have to manage so that just means that when they bet on rivers like their incentive is to make us fold because that's the only way that they could win the hand right so they are predictable they play too many hands and their bets tend to be hand incentive driven uh calls tend to be loose right that goes hand in hand with the hand incentive driven bets they call to loose loosely and then they find themselves with too many weak hands where they have no choice but to start trying to bet and make us fold raises tend to be fairly tight so even though they're likely to bet because they have no hope and they want to win hands when they raise their raises tend to be on the tighter side volatile wrecks they're predictable too in the opposite way right we can count on volatile wrecks to take aggressive actions if they sense weakness they're kind of like a shark they just try to they just go nuts raise too frequently try to make you fold too often their calls tend to be looser because they don't want to give up they tend to value it's in their nature to value winning pots above all else so the way that they the way that a volatile wreck thinks about poker is that if they win the hand then that means they're playing winning poker and if they lost the hand well that means they're playing losing poker right and that is a very dangerous position to be in because eventually you're just going to bomb off stacks you're going to be losing way too much money in pots you have no business in playing so that is a volatile wreck and they're predictable they're predictable in that they just take way too many aggressive actions they're driven by winning the pots i'm sure most of us know players just like this who just want to win hands like let's just play cards and win hands and if i fold well folding that means that i lost the hand and that that doesn't feel good right number three so variable number three is bet sizes so larger bets tend to be tighter which forces tighter calls and raises smaller bets tend to be looser which forces looser calls and raises people are scared to lose a lot when they bluff right like it's really as simple as that it there's they're driven by emotion um that we're going to get into but larger bets as in cash games a larger c bet tends to be tighter smaller sea bets tend to be looser let's imagine you open pre-flop from the cutoff you got one caller a wreck out of the blinds and are now faced with a post-flop decision so here we have king seven deuce why do you choose to bet smaller with your bluffs on king seven deuce right risk aversion pure human emotion why risk more when one one-third gets the job done right why risk more when less gets the job done this is a very simple thought but very very relevant um on the flip side here greed when you have a strong hand you think why i bet less when my opponent's continuing range is inflexible right so the two emotions that make this true larger bets tend to be tighter smaller bets tend to be looser risk aversion and greed just pure human emotions human tendencies it's uh this is backed up by mass data and really just backed up by common sense right like our intuition can tell us exactly why greed comes into play when we have a hand like ace king when we have you know king seven of diamonds on king seven deuce or pocket deuces yeah we wanna play a bigger pot right we're just greedy we wanna we wanna put more money in in the middle and when we have a hand like eight nine of hearts yeah we want about one-third right because we're risk-averse we don't why risk more when one-third gets the job done andy says he would always bet one-third there should i watch for opponent's bet sizes absolutely you should right absolutely you should this is a variable that is extremely important um which archetypes does this matter most against these two guys the little teddy bear and this you know kind of evil maniacal bear that's kind of weathered and got a lot of scar tissue um this volatile rack in the passive wreck right it matters the most against them because they're more likely to be influenced by their human emotions um andy also asked if he should change his strategy against weaker players and you absolutely should anybody that's not going to notice the difference between one third and two third just exploited exploitive exploitatively it's a easy for me to say huh um size differently based on the strength of your hand against villains that you know aren't gonna notice that are kind of uh for lack of a better word clueless right and now we're gonna look at some range construction using mass data right so this is a wreck facing two different size c bets and this is across all varieties of board textures so rec call versus 30 percent c bet brett call versus 70 c but you can see trash right here 21 trash with a 30 8 trash versus the 70 percent matthew asks what is c 3 oak i actually wondered that myself for a while that's three of a kind the old three oak down here um so 21 trash 30 in the 30 percent c-bat and then only 8 versus the 70 c bet right they just find it harder to continue facing the large c bet sizing backdoor flushes gut shots um you can see backdoor flush calls way more frequently versus the smaller sizing gut shots it appears as if rex you know they like their gut shot and they don't care they're going to call with their gut shot one way or the other um and then the value here this is going to be pretty similar right i would say that like this top pair good kicker here the differentials between you know this two percent is they're just raising this thirty percent c bet um they're not calling less frequently they're just raising with it right so here's rex raises versus thirty percent c bet and versus 70 c-bet right so they find a lot more trash and a lot more of these back door hands 27 29 here versus five six fourteen percent facing the seventy percent c bet so the trash just naturally gets folded more frequently from their range they don't raise a ton of trash facing the larger seabed they raised way more facing the smaller c-bet variable number four and we're going to get into some more specific mass data on a couple different board textures here in a minute with some charts that show the differences uh cleanly so variable number four is board texture so dry boards equals looser bets looser calls and booster raises and looking at mass data once again you open preflop passive direct calls out of the big blind and we get this flop so a dry flop king seven deuce rainbow looking at the mass data recreational players on this board fold to c-bets 48 of the time so they fold quite frequently facing a c bet their calling range versus this c bet is percent trash thirteen percent backdoor flush three percent gut shots uh open end straight draw is uh whenever you solve for whenever you search for mass data um it's hard to get the boards exactly like king seven deuce we just do king high and then dry so likely some like king seven five type hands got in there but um villains fold to c-bet is super high they continue with 19 trash um they raise with 17 trash and then a lot of their raising range is condensed to these top pair wheat kickers top pair good kickers that's going to be 42 percent of their raising range here looking at mass data on this type of board that is a very high percentage they tend to raise their two pair on these types of boards right 14 whereas they only call with two percent so if they flop two pair looks like they're taking a lot more aggressive actions they're slow playing three of a kind at about the same frequency then they have all of these types of you know less than top pair type hands uh ranges that they call with so 21 uh 35 of their hands are just um less than top hair type hands so pocket eights pocket nines seven x deus ex and then the other pocket pairs wet boards wet boards mean tighter bets tighter calls and tighter raises so ranges are tighter the wetter the board is nba example once again we open pre-flop passive rat calls out of the big blind seven eight nine is our flop so 789 with a flush draw we can see here first of all the wreck folds versus c bet 31 so they just continue way more frequently than in the instance of a dry board calling range versus c bet you can see less trash than before 15 percent backdoor flushes bunch of gut shots open in straight draws flush draws combo draws pear plus draws they have a lot of hands that they continue with here when they call versus a c bet and then when they raise back door flushes very few not a lot of trash not a ton of gut shots a few open-ended straight draws um pair plus draws then down here in the value quadrant you know a lot of values so over pairs two pairs three of a kind straights top pair weak kicker top pair good kicker very condensed on this wet board when they raise versus a c bet to these type of value hands and just a little comparison here of the range makeup when an opponent calls so on the dry board we can see that looking at the green and yellow quadrants here 72 percent of villains continuing range is in the green and yellow quadrants which are trash backdoor flush draws gut shots and pairs less than top that is a massive massive amount of villains range that is very weak right so this means villains call on a dry board this is loose right when villains range looks like this that is a loose range then we look at the wet board call versus c-bet we can see just a comparison of the green so just a comparison of the green um quadrants here less trash and gunshot type hands less top pairs less than top and then a bunch of top pair we kicker top pair good kicker two pairs and sets so just the more red you see is the more value in villains range the more red tones so this red and then orange and then over here this red and this orange range makeup of villains when they raise on dry boards versus sea bets and then on wet boards versus sea bets so again top pair good kicker when they raise on a dry board versus a c bet we have 42 or we have 11 um top pair good kicker and then over here hands that are better than top pair good kicker that raise i guess we have actually we have 25 28 here value quadrant and then over here we have straight sets two pair over pair top pair good kicker that's going to be in the 40 45 percent um yeah 45 top hair good kicker plus when villains raise on wet boards compared to 28 percent my math is correct yeah 28 percent on dry board so raises on wet boards weight are tighter more value heavy than raises on dry boards which again you know makes intuitive sense right we can intuitively understand that villains on dry boards when they raise us they just have less value in their range it's harder to have good hands on wet boards easier to have good hands raises on wet boards tend to be tighter in their construction now we have some villain specific data points right so pay close attention to every hand even ones you aren't in lines and bet sizings used by your opponents are worth their weight in gold why are historical villain specific data points worth their weight in gold why are they so valuable they're tells they give us indicators as to how tight or how loose villains ranges are and then we get to make exploitative decisions against our opponents based on that information i have a poor soul here that i have found some hands that he played this is the same exact villain that plays both hands now hand number one we have this is the board this is our hand so pre-flop the villain open small blind 3x they bet 50 percent c bet turn they bet 27 river they bet 17 so their hand is jax you can see that 50 on the flop they size down on the turn with their second pair and then they size even smaller on the river with their second pair right board number two very similar board king six deuce and then king five deuce this same villain has an ace and three action a little bit different they 4.5 button iso versus a middle position limp on the flop they bet 50 with their gut shot and then on the turn so the turn is interesting because there's a deviation 27 percent with second pair 50 with a straight we see a little bit of greed come into play right we see a little little bit of greed once villain turns the wheel versus when villain has second pair so sizing indicator here giving us a clue that this bet is likely looser this bet is tighter and then on the river here 17 percent with villains jacks versus 100 when the king pairs when they have a straight so loose construction here on the river this is a loose bet this is a tight bet this is a hand that wants value right so if we can discern that this 17 bet is loose then we get the call with a bunch of our bluff catchers right knowing that we have a fair amount of showdown equity versus this tight bet on the river we can fold quite frequently knowing we don't have a lot of showdown value and that villain is likely just nutted up here when they choose this different sizing now we're gonna play a little game what do you think villain has and this is the same villain right that we just looked at these two boards same exact dude taking what we've learned from just these two little examples of hands that they've played what do you think villain has here's the board ace deuce 4 here's the action we have a 3x pre-flop open from middle position ace deuce for two diamonds our villain bets 50 pot loose or tight likely that loose more inclined to say loose and then on the turn we have a tray and our opponent bets 28 on the turn so going back to last hand over here about 27 with the jacks now he bets 28 here on the turn is this looser type loose loose loose loose loose loose loose loose construction here on the turn they're sizing down and filling has a straight they're likely to size up with the pure strength of their hand now here on the river we have a hundred percent river bet when the board puts a wheel when the river puts a wheel on the board 100 pot size bet is this going to be loose or tight what do you think matters more him having many sixes in his range or whether or not his bet is tight or loose whether or not he has value in this specific line that he has used the range construction is what matters more than anything right like if villain is tight here doesn't really matter how many six x's they have in their range because that's what they're repping um it's easy to add extra complexity to the thought process and be like well they don't have many six x's so i should call here but if villains betting tight on this river and they have specific betting patterns and uh tells with the sizings that they choose that's going to be the more relevant more important data point and villain has exactly the six eight of different suits so they somehow managed to raise for middle position with a six and an eight of different suits yeah chuck says villain may want to avoid a chop that is possible however there's also a lot of incentive from a passive recreational player to check back so that they get their chop right so that if they bet villains can't raise them there's a natural fear of getting raised on the river when you put more money in the pot so careful with that uh you know that line of thinking recreational players uh you know they're they're more instinctive they play with their emotions so they can show up with some really weird hands that we don't give them credit for in the moment maybe they're just bored and wanted to play a hand who knows the reasons why the reasons that drive a person to open with a six and an eight of different suits so wise words i want to quote a very wise human myself you don't play poker to sound smart you play poker to win money so try to avoid complexity in these situations don't overthink it villain has a strategy construction there where we can discern that flop is loose turn is loose and river is tight and then that's going to tell us what we ought to be doing right so use the situational incentives to punish your opponents so i'm going to go into some heuristics here as to how you ought to be reacting based on the situational incentives but it's it's very easy to pass up a plus ev decision waiting for different combination of cards right waiting for the perfect stars to align and when you're playing cash games you just want to make the exploits you want to find as many exploits as you possibly can and then you want to execute them that's what's going to get you the money over time so don't be passing up spots where you think they're plus ev based on some of the variables that we've just we've just talked about right um whether it be on like king seven deuce phil one third and then us finding a wide check raise range so that we're attacking a loose bet like if villains don't defend often enough on king seven deuce and they they're see betting range then we just need to exploit that we need to drop the hammer down um where you can kind of go on a you know slippery slope is by check raising very frequently on those types of boards and then not realizing we're not adjusting that ranges contract um once they face our raise and then call so not serve super well by making future bets but yeah just use your situational incentives to punish your opponents some quick heuristics versus loose bets attack with loose raises and defend with loose calls so boards where villain is in your best estimation betting loosely attack them with loose raises defend with loose calls so lots of pairs some ace highs just you have to attack their loose bets with loose raises and loose calls tight bets we're going to defend with equity driven hands right so flush draws open in straight draws some gut shots if that makes sense if we have the pot odds we want to raise with top end values so when villain uses a makes a tight bet whether it be like betting on a wet board or sizing up on a board like king seven deuce and we have a hand like deuces or king seven or pocket sevens we just need to raise with our top end values so take advantage of the fact that they're kind of telegraphing that they're making a tight bet and maximize value when you have it and then realize equity when you have flush draws open in straight draws because the reality is like if you're drawing to an open end straight draw you want your opponent to have stronger hands you want them to be fairly tight so that when you hit you get paid off right so defend versus tight bets with equity driven hands and then raise with top end value jeff asks how do i know how much to infer from betting patterns when there are so few hands you actually see at showdown it's tough i mean you really need to pay attention right you you just need to see the bet sizings that villains are using try to notice deviations or multiple sizings on similar boards so if villain raises pre-flop and then uses two different sizings on tight boards there's probably a reason right so one showdown you know like allen just said one showdown can tell a surprising amount he's right like just one showdown you can see um or you can construct a fairly accurate strategy of what villains doing so the faster you can find these exploits the faster you can discern between loose and tight bets the faster that you can exploit these tendencies versus loose calls um you know when you bet and villain is constructing they have a loose call so if you remember the queen queen green quadrant before when villain calls with a lot of trash and gut shots and hands like that just need to be bluffing on future streets right like that's the exploit we need to over bluff when villains are defending too loosely so up the aggression on turns versus loose flop calls and then we can size down exploitatively with value on future streets this is more applicable to villains that are not paying attention so the recreational players and going back to my previous webinars that's where most of the ev is derived from our strategy from the recreational players so when villains have loose calls size down with your value on future streets right like no reason to be ultra greedy when villains are defending with a loose range you want to maximize your value um pretty easy quick heuristic versus tight calls you want to bluff less often right like this is pretty clear don't bluff versus tight calls because you don't get to realize as much fold equity size up with value on future streets so when villain makes a tight call and they're likely to continue size up with your value so get more money in the pot when villain has a tight calling range and you have um value driven initiative you've got a hand that beats their value", metadata={'source': 'k10hX5TZBn0', 'title': 'How To READ Your Opponent’s HANDS [Poker Strategy]', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 25788, 'thumbnail_url':

[Document(page_content="today i'm excited to bring to you a video that will really help you improve your live or online cash game skills it is one of my favorite parts from my extensive cash game master class where we are going to be discussing playing very deep stack then the adjustments you need to make to crush one two no limit hold them all the way up to five ten or even higher we're gonna discuss when you should be getting it all in before the flop for 200 blinds or more i know a lot of you get it in way too light i'm actually going to give you access to a brand new series we just released at pokercoaching.com by one of my favorite poker players in the world jonathan jaffe he gets in there he battles hard he understands game theory optimal strategy very well but also how to adjust to take advantage of whatever his opponent's doing correctly and you can get access to that right now at pokercoaching.com crush let's discuss 200 big blind deep stacked adjustments and understand that the adjustments you should make become bigger and bigger as you get deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper stacked we have to discuss a specific point though so we're gonna discuss 200 big blinds but realize if you are 150 big winds the adjustments will be less dramatic if you're 500 big lines deep then the adjustments will be more dramatic that said nearly everything we've discussed a hundred big lines deep still applies except for there are a few key differences you must take into account as you get deeper the first is that your stack off threshold which is the amount of equity you need to happily get all in is higher so you're gonna need better and better hands to be happy getting in bigger and bigger chip stacks also being in position is more and more important because it allows for you to use larger bet sizes and raises and build the pot bigger and bigger as you see fit and also the nut advantage drives your overall strategy to an even larger degree than your equity advantage as you get deeper and deeper and the ability to make the nuts and block the nuts becomes even more and more important and we're going to discuss these three things and you're gonna see that all of them all the adjustments uh that you will be making deep stacked are to some extent derived from these three big differences so first things first your stack off threshold increases and to be clear the stack off threshold is the point in which a hand becomes strong enough such that you are happy to play for all the money right away as a very clear example of the differences that deep sacks make let's say you're playing 20 big blinds deep and the button raises you defend king nine of hearts in the big blind the flop comes king seven two you check the button continuation that's small and at this point king nine twenty big blinds deep for top pair okay kicker is a premium hand that you are happy to play for all the money so you're going to check raise and you're going to call it off of your opponent's shoves yes you're going to be beat sometimes but when you are beat you only lose 20 big lines it's not that big of a deal and king 9 in the scenario is very very likely to be the best hand but if we're 200 lines deep in the same scenario where button raises we call big blind we check they bet 25 pot we can no longer raise and look to stack off if we check raise them here and they call or re-raise it's not good for our k9 at all but you see some players making this blunder quite often these are players who are used to playing shallower stat games in general or players who play a lot of short stack tournaments right they get a hand like um king jack on this board you know king jack's pretty good on king seven two they'll check raise it they'll get re-raised they'll just blast their money and they think oh probably the best hand but they're almost always behind and this is even more and more and more true as you get deeper and deeper and deeper so for dripping blind seep it would be a disaster to check raise this flop so this hand goes from being a very premium made hand very shallow stacked to a very clear marginal made hand when you're keeper stack so deeper stacked the plan is just a check call check call flop check call turn check call river and um that's it very clear marginal made hand so sack off threshold changes and essentially this impacts your strategy in a few key ways first on boards where you lack the nut advantage your continuation bet frequency and your check raising frequency or your raising frequency goes down whenever your opponent has more nuts than you or just like a decent amount of hands that are really really high equity and you either don't have those or your high equity range is very very small just because they don't make up much of your range to begin with you're gonna do a whole lot more checking and calling than you are betting and raising also you're gonna find that the cost of reopening the action on the river is higher because if you bet too thin your opponent can just start raising you aggressively let's take a look at a few gto examples here to show a few key adjustments as you get deeper and deeper stacked so on the left we have 100 blind strategy on the right we have 200 big blind strategy so here button raises big blind calls flop comes ten eight six okay big blind checks 100 big blinds deep we are checking 23 of the time betting you know a lot of our range using mixed sizes right sometimes two-thirds sometimes one-third but take a look at the 200 blind strategy even though our equity is roughly the same 55 compared to 54 roughly we're now checking 44 of the time when we are deeper stacked and that's because in this scenario even though we have some nuts in our range so does our opponent our opponents can be sitting there with hands like nine eight nine seven ten eight eight six right they're gonna have a lot of nuts on this board and a lot of our range is not the nuts even though we do have this very large concentration of off-suit and well mostly suited connected type hands so also notice that when we do bet here we're betting big for the most part so we're checking more often but when we bet we're betting big so essentially we are polarizing our range right off the bat okay notice big differences what are some big differences here well take a look at aces right aces is a hand that if you bet and get raised it's it's certainly not great and you don't want to get it in 200 big lines deep so that's a hand you bet less often and it's a spot where you can check it back because you're somewhat unlikely to get out drawing with aces you just will see hands like jack's betting very frequently though notice jackson's betting frequently and big on both scenarios because it's likely the best hand but very vulnerable to being outdrawn notice that the marginal made hands what are marginal made hands marginal made hands are gonna be some eights and sixes the eights are checking a little bit more often just a little bit more often deep sacked compared to 100 blinds deep right like you see queen eight betting about sixty percent of time here about forty percent of the time here subtle difference but take a look at the sixes take a look at like queen six and jack six nine six right seven six six five these sixes when you're playing 200 big lines deep are checking a large portion of the time whereas 100 lines deep they're actually betting still a large chunk of the time so you see that the very clear marginal made hands check more often as you get deeper same thing with ace high right like ace king acquaintance jack checks a pretty large chunk of the time when we are playing 200 big lines deep wearers that bets a lot of the time playing deeper sacked i'm sorry shallower stacked that's a lot of time playing shallower stacked i'm probably going to miss speak of time or two in this video i apologize it's hard to keep all this stuff straight in my head so as you see when we're deeper we're betting less often but more polarized in general especially when we lack the nut advantage okay let's take a look at us out of position spot where button raises big blind calls flop comes jack six two big blind checks button bets a third pot okay 100 lines deep we fold 27 of the time 200 big lines deep we fold 30 a little bit more we fold a little bit more because we're going to realize our equity worse right and you're gonna find this is another common thing when you're out of position you fold a little bit more often as you get deeper and deeper and deeper because hands like um ace 8 or a7 are going to realize their equity just a little bit worse i realize here they stick around roughly the same amount but you're going to find that very often some of the weaker marginal maintenance in your range are start to fold out just a touch more as you get deeper and deeper and this applies even more as you're facing bigger and bigger bets also you'll find that the hands that check raise don't check raise quite as often or they check raise none right so let's take a look at a hand like ace jack right ace jack is a hand where when we're playing a hundred big blind deep we check raise about half the time and obviously not folding 200 big lines deep though we check raise it only about uh 35 percent of the time so a little bit less often just a little bit what about jack six take a look 100 big ones deep jack six check raises every time 200 big lines even check raise is only about sixty percent of the time so a little bit less often right something else you'll note is that when we're playing a hundred big blind sleep we raise small the vast majority of the time when we raise right and we're raising eighteen and a half percent of the time so we're raising a pretty good amount whereas when we are raising two hundred big blinds deep we're raising with mixed sizes now some big raises some smaller raises and we're raising only about 14 of the time so 18 compared to 14. so we're a little bit more cautious out of position and we fold a little bit more often right notice that the hands that are raising big are going to be the very polarized hands so very polarized range will be raising big that's going to be the nuts for sets and uh draws usually the bad draws like bad gut shots so let's see if that's that holds true here we see pocket sixes and pocket twos do do a lot of raising and the draws are the ones using the bigger size in general the bad draws or well the gut shots right hands that are very unlikely to be good now but can improve to the nuts so the hands that can improve to the nuts are usually the ones that prefer the bigger raise size in general okay let's talk about the cost of reopening the action on the river when you are in position on the river you can check back and realize 100 of your equity every single time right but when you bet you may think i need to be going for value sometimes you're going to get check raise bluffed and then that makes you fold out your hand that has decent equity and as you get deeper and deeper and deeper stacked the cost of reopening the action is higher and higher because the out of position player can then check raise gigantic assuming they play well remember how we discussed whenever the player is out of position they should be checking with some nuts some portion of the time in scenarios where the player in position should be betting a decent amount of the time right and that results in their checking range being well protected to the point that if you value bet too thin they can just start check raising you very aggressively and there's not a whole lot you can do about it so for this reason you're going to find that you want to have hands that have a larger amount of equity to value bet the river when you're deeper stacked and if you find that your particular opponent value bets too thinly you can absolutely crush them by playing aggressively against them let's take a look at two examples of this concept folds around to us we raise the button of course big blind calls king 102 they check we bet 20 bucks fine and good whatever you can go bigger you go smaller i don't think it's that big of a deal in general you're usually fine to use bigger bet sizes but you know again you're probably mixing it up to some extent opponent calls turns to three definitely a spot to go for a bet and a big bet nice big chunky bet if this turn brought more draws like say it brought a backdoor flush draw you'd probably want to bet even bigger over betting the turn in spots where you have a lot of effective nuts and the opponent does not remember when they check call your flop bet especially a big flop bet they lose all the garbage in their range but you still have all the garbage in your range or a lot of it right so their range is pretty strong here our range is more nut heavy but a little bit weaker so when we bet here we're gonna be betting polar eyes for the most part and king queen's definitely good enough to make a big bet here maybe king jack and better something like that opponent calls where's the nine of spades opponent checks this is a spot where we basically always have the best hand the problem though is that if we check i'm sorry if we bet the opponent can check raise us pretty aggressively because they're gonna have some backdoor flushes and they're also gonna have some straights and you really really really don't want to be against a range that is well protected and contains those hands so this is a spot where even though we very likely have the best hand when we go check check we're going to win this pod almost every time if we bet and get raised it is awful and if your opponent's anywhere near decent they realize this river is not so great for all of their marginal made hands either and they're gonna start folding out a lot of their bluff catchers so we're gonna have a hard time getting much value from worse this is a spot where maybe if you're playing against a really really bad player perhaps you can go for a 60 bet exploitatively to try to get caught by a weak king or even a hand like ace 10 but that would be awful against good players good players are going to absolutely punish you if you do that so check it back check check we win sometimes we lose sometimes but we're probably going to win let's take a look at another spot button raises we call big blind with ace 10 easy check call easy check call again notice if the opponent started using a bigger size kind of like i was just recommending this would be a tougher spot still probably call though river we check opponent bets 70. they're getting uh they're doing perhaps what i just recommended you do against the weaker players who will find calls with ace 10 in the spot right but this is a situation where i think we don't really want to be calling all that often so you want to be raising in this scenario with hands that block your opponent's auto calls remember you always won't be looking for spots to put in bluffs so what are the opponents auto calls here auto calls are gonna be flushes right just so happens we block the nut flush also it's really nice that the opponent uses a 70 bet because this almost always indicates a not a range containing not a whole lot of premium hands because remember if they had a very premium hand they'd also be betting polarized right when people use this half pot size from a gto point of view at least they usually are gonna have hands like a lot of kings or two pair type hands so look this is a spot where i'm assuming your opponent's not a big calling station this is just a pretty easy all-in we block the nuts we also block the like sets that may call blast it this is a scenario where the opponent has to be very very cautious betting right i mean imagine in our previous hand if our opponent rips it in on the river here if we bet any mount on the river the opponent rips it in we gotta fold right gotta fold they're gonna fold a ton in this scenario you're gonna find that again the blocker to their auto calls is very very very very important and when they bet this 70 year most people are gonna have a pretty good hand like two pair you may say you're risking a lot aren't you yeah we are but it's gonna succeed a lot you're gonna find that your opponents fold a large large large chunk of the time in that scenario and you know you you should be balanced if you are playing at someone who is good but that's a that's a hand that is particularly great to shove there that a lot of people don't because you block the auto calls right okay you're gonna find that also position is even more valuable as the stack to pot ratio increases as you get deeper and deeper being the one who can put in the last bet is huge because you essentially determine the size of the pot so this will affect your post flop strategies by seeing the out of position player checking way more often remember we saw a few spots where the out of position player like say raise low jack and the button calls we saw a few spots a hundred blinds deep like um king seven five king king six where that player could get away with betting big 100 of the time but that does not exist anymore as you get deeper and deeper and deeper also you're gonna find that in general in spots where you should often be using a more polarized strategy again but you're going to find from out of position you still do use some small bets also you're going to find that if you really want to go deep on poker you may want to start implementing a more complex strategy to use three bet sizes on the flop we've been discussing a third and two-thirds this entire course for simplicity that does leave a little bit of value on the table compared to a strategy that uses one third two thirds and three and a full full pot right if you wanted to go really deep you could add five sizes whatever right you can make poker as difficult as you want to but as you get deeper and deeper there is a decent amount of value to be had in adding an additional bigger bet size to your potential options um doing this will essentially make the pop bigger with a strong polarized range you're going to find that a pot size bet with a very polarized range like nuts and junky draws is quite good it's gonna put your opponents in a pretty tough spot so let's take a look at a scenario where we raise low jack button calls flop comes ace jack five okay 100 big lines deep we check about half the time 200 big lines deep we checked 62 percent of the time despite having basically the same range and basically the same equity same range advantage same range we're checking 62 percent out of position compared to 50 n percent and i'm sorry 50 out of position 200 lines deep compared to 100 big blinds deep so what are some differences and if you take a look basically every hand is checking a little bit more often across the board but notably a lot of the asexes are checking more often and that's just because on this board with a flush draw there's going to be more run outs where hand like ace king is just not the effect of nuts so you're gonna be betting it a little bit less often and again just like look at literally every hand right we see like pocket jacks checks a little bit more often ace jack checks a little bit more often ace queen checks a little bit more often underpairs check a little bit more often we are still betting with a lot of a lot of hands in general in this spot using a very very mixed strategy but just a whole lot more checking out of position take a look at the uh king 75 board this is one where 100 blinds deep you can bet big every time because you have loads and loads of good kings right pairs are pretty great etc 200 big lines deep though we see a very different strategy again using mostly small bets but now betting with our a much more polarized range in general obviously the strategy's still very mixed but if you look at it most of the good kings are betting um various hands like underpairs bottom piers etc are betting again it's a tough thing to actually figure out exactly what like how to play this from an implementable point of view from out of position you should just be mixing it up a lot but we see some of the quote unquote marginal made hands like ace ten and ace jack doing a lot of checking same thing with hands like pocket queens doing a lot of checking so hands like that are probably going to fall into a checking range if you're using an implementable strategy whereas um stuff like king queen and king jack probably won't be betting maybe king 10 and king 9 check from implementable point of view maybe low asex backdoor draws can do some betting maybe like ace queen and ace jack do more checking etc but but obviously i want to show you this is a really really clear difference because even though we have the same amount of equity the fact that we are out of position forces us to have a stronger hand to stack off right and it turns out a lot of our hands in this scenario like king jack are good but are they good enough to stack off yeah i don't know i don't know also you're gonna want to use bigger bet sizes in general across the board for the most part and again you may want to add a third bet size to your flop betting strategy on the turn you're gonna find that when you over bet a hundred big blinds the very often you're using 120 pot bet size but but 200 big blinds deep you're gonna find that that big bet size gets even bigger and as you're deeper in deeper stack that bet size can get even bigger and bigger and bigger because when you're betting this big bet size you're very polarized right when you're very polarized there's not a whole lot your opponent can do about it so let's take a look at some examples here we raise big blind calls ten eight five component checks well we actually had a similar spot to this earlier let me go back and find it ten eight sorry sorry boards 1085 1086 is the example we had earlier earlier you saw that we're going to be betting jacks close to 100 of the time in both of these spots but the small bet size is used sometimes 100 blinds deep but never 200 blinds deep right and that's because when we're deeper and deeper we're usually going to want to be polarizing our range right off the bat using a bigger size in general so this is a spot where shallower stack you're probably going to mix it up if you felt inclined you saw the over pairs were like all mixing various bet sizes big and small but mostly bedding here you're going to just basically always bet big so we do go 25 pot let's play this hand out to the river see what happens opponent calls turns a king well think about stack off threshold right we probably have the best hand but if we bet and get raised or even called we don't love it sorry about that ruined the hand um this is why we got to check it back on the turn pretty clearly on the river if the opponent checks what do we do it's kind of similar to that king queen hand we saw earlier where if we bet and get raised it's pretty miserable if you're playing against a lot of opponents who will just always have a 10 or an 8 here because they always better flush on the river or they always bet a king on the river then you know maybe you can get away with a dollar bet to try to get full value from a ten or an eight but again if your opponent is good and they are protecting their checking range you cannot justify value bet here that's an opponent that's twenty dollars so this is a very easy call in basically all games however again if you're a bonus especially terrible and you know that this small bet indicates exactly a 10. no kings exactly a 10 or an eight and you think they're going to call you with a 10 or 8 if you raise then you should just raise because if their small bet means literally a 10 only then you have the nuts right and there really aren't a ton of kings they should have in their range when they call your kind of big flop bet if you think about it they could have king 10 but a lot of people bet bigger on the river with king 10 or 10 or king 8 right and if they check raise all the two pair and sets on the flop and they check raised draws on the flop it means they have a ten or an eight right however most people are not that awful at poker i know a lot of people like to think their opponents are atrociously terrible and you know maybe some of them are but you're going to find that most of your opponents are at least somewhat competent and when they are structuring their small bet size range they are going to have a few flushes here and they are also going to have some hands that are just betting and calling like a king so this is a very easy call due to pod odds due to beating a lot of your opponents tens and eights that will value that here i mean think back to the gto strategy out of position we should be uh betting here small with a lot of marginal made hands right that are probably good like a 10 like maybe even an eight like a king but this is not a spot where we can raise four values so just easily call here we raise king 10 suited big blind calls component checks we can mix it up with our bet sizes here we go seven this time i probably would have just liked a 15 bat whatever opponent calls turns to six oh all the flush draws arrive you're gonna find from a gto point of view deep stacked or even a hundred people blind steve you're gonna want to use a big bet size here anytime the turn brings two flush draws you have a load of draws and you also have a load of nuts and here you want to be very polarized so if pot's 35 we're gonna want to go 150 pot give or take using a pretty pretty polarized range so we do go 55 good opponent calls rivers are two they check can we go for value here well i think the answer is obviously yes we have essentially the nuts you may say oh but you lose to pocket fives and pocket sixes and four three of spades and four three of hearts yeah we do we also beat everything else so this is a scenario where we have a very very easy big bet now we're probably a little bit too deep to shove it all in i have to imagine if we gave the gto a uh three and a half x pot all in here it would probably just be mostly like sets so we'll probably just have multiple sizes here if i had to guess you're gonna find gto very often jams stuff like the middle and bottom set here and uses big but not all in sizes of stuff like king 10 and king king six so we don't go 200 i think this is fine and good you may say but my opponents always fold and over bet the river well then obviously if your opponents make a gigantic blunder of always folding to an over bed on the river you should be over betting with entirely bluffs and betting whatever amount they'll call with the nuts but again i'm presuming our opponent is not terrible this is a spot where if the opponent does have a king they should probably just find a call they block our value bets they don't block our bluffs to some extent right um that said exploitatively if you know your opponent's only over bet with the nuts and you're sitting here with like i don't know king king seven king seven of hearts it's probably just a fold right if you know your opponents do not use good strong polarized strategies but against a good player if you're sitting over the king you just gotta call when all the draws miss when all the draws missed you have to be a little bit call happy and notice this is a spot where most people bet 20 on the turn pot would have been only 75 there they bet 50 on the river and they get called so they went 70 bucks on the turn in the river here we ended up winning like 250 just by using a good strong polarized strategy that is closer to the gto strategy okay also we're gonna find that nut advantage drives strategy and the ability to make the nut slash block the nuts goes way up in value so when deciding which draws to check raise or barrel you want to use draws that make the nuts more often these are going to be straight draws and flush draws ace high flush draws even stuff like gut shots to the nuts you want to be drawing to the nuts you do not want to be drawing two hands that are not the nuts because when you make a strong but non-nut hand and a bunch of money goes in that's not so good also you're going to find that you want to fold draws that have big reverse implied odds especially when you're out of position on the turn when lots of money starts to go in the pot because some of your outs will be dead and also you don't really want to be checked calling out a position with something like a nine high draw because then you can't really win on the river when you miss right so when you have the nut advantage you want to be applying pressure and you want because you're going to be drastically over realizing your equity in general so let's go through a few examples here so let's take a look at lojack well big blind versus low jack on jack six six okay in this scenario we are facing a i think small bet on the flop small but a decent amount of the time so 100 lines deep you see we are raising 18 percent of the time right but 200 blinds deep we're raising 25 of the time a pretty good amount more right also interestingly enough we're using a lot of small sizes 200 big blinds deep that's because in this scenario when we have a six we don't really care if our opponent sticks around and um you know we want to be raising with just more bluff center and pick up additional equity on the later betting ground so we see stuff like um like queen 10 right raising a large chunk of the time we see just like sporadic um spreading nonsense going for bluffs a large chunk of the time right also we see slightly more thin value bets because we are going for um well we're going for more bluffs but also notice our nuts here our sixes are still in great great great great shape you can go for thinner value when you check raise in spots where your opponent just cannot re-raise you because in this scenario your opponent can't re-raise you they can't just go around re-raising with um you know pocket aces because if they have a six you're in terrible terrible terrible shape so we can go for more raises because a lot of our draws are gonna be able to make the opponent fold out very strong hands by the river like imagine you check raise the queen nine your opponent calls you bet the turn big you bet the river big it's a miserable spot even with pocket aces if you can make even pocket aces very miserable that's clearly a very good spot so here you have a nut advantage in the big blind so you're gonna be check raising more often okay let's take a look at this scenario big blind versus cut off 60 bet on queen eight seven here we lack the nut advantage right the opponent's gonna have like we just don't have a whole lot of nuts here and we're pretty deep stack so here we're lacking nuts and we're deep stacks so lacking nuts and deep stacked you're gonna find that we don't raise all that often when we do raise it's gonna be withdraws that are pretty good so notice we're raising queen eight queen seven eights and seven is obviously very good hands then what six five nine six seven six for the bottom pair draw various flush draws so notice we're raising with a bunch of various flush draws which are all pretty good and um a few of these well i suppose these are these are straight and flush draws that are raising right so the six five and the nine six that are raising are almost entirely flush draw flush draw with straight draw so again very strong combo draws high equity flush draws and super nuts and then everything else is calling notice a lot of folding 41 right because again we're out of position deep stack we're going to under realize our equity as you see here the flush draws that are raising are mostly the high equity ones right so we see 10 9 raising a lot combo draw 9 6 combo draw 6'5 combo draw ace highs are really good then we see a lot of the weaker ones doing a little bit more calling like the um 5 4 6 5 5 3 4 3 right a lot of these weaker combo draws do more calling okay so realize we're not always raising every flush draw here a lot of people make the error of taking literally every flush draw and raising so you're gonna find the cards that wrap around the eight and the six i'm sorry eight and a seven so nine six ten nine six five these are the ones that do more raising because they're gonna make more premium hands on more run outs than the naked flush draws right also notice that hands like ace track and ace ten do a lot of calling because they can um they can just check call flop check check turn check check river and win some portion of the time they have more showdown value also notice the stuff like um eight five and eight six pair plus flush draw i gotta imagine same thing with the seven i actually don't have any sevens for whatever oh i'm sorry we don't have sevens obviously um seven's on the board but yeah eight six and eight five do a lot of calling right notice all the eights do a lot of calling so pair plush flush draws are often doing a lot of calling in the spot because they again have showdown value all right let's talk about big blind strategy versus cut off on eight queen eight seven six so big blind checks cut off bets big blind raises cut off calls on the six turn so in this scenario while we do have a lot of draws a lot of the rest of our range is really really good right like again all these two pairs are really good these hands that are very high frequency are mostly like really really good hands in this scenario right so this is a spot where we have sets that are still very very strong and high equity draws right which are also very very strong notice also a lot of our draws in this scenario are gonna have a nine which bumps up their equity a bit right this is a spot where we are going to continue betting very very frequently we're checking 38 what are we mostly checking notice marginal made hand here draw that did not complete at all here some top pairs right top pairs make sense to check if we have them at this point if you do check raise the top pair here like ace queen or queen jack and you do get called your opponent's range gets very strong right so now these hands become decent but still marginal to some extent let's take a look at this spot let's say we bet the turn and the opponent calls and the river is the king of spades so now sets go way down in value two pairs go way down in value right notice now that we want to be sure we still have some nuts in our range but take a look at this general strategy in this spot right while we are betting some of our nut flushes some of our flushes are not flushers are checking you see ace five eight four eight stream we have them are checking a large chunk of the time in the spot right to protect the checking range which is also stuff like sets two pairs etc um ten nine is still value betting notice we have some various nines that are bluffing like ace nine if we had it the s9 off suit check raises flop and goes for it notice 6'5 actually this is gonna be spades right most of the time so that makes sense um so yeah as you see in this scenario you want to be able to make the bets on or you may want to be able to make the nuts on essentially all run outs and this is why it's important to make sure you have some good draws in your checking range and check calling range and if we go back to the flop over here you see that this is why we're mixing it up very much with our flush draws because when we check call we want to be able to make the absolute nuts sometimes and when we check raise we want to be able to make the absolute nuts sometimes a lot of people make the error of just always raising all their draws or always raising all their nut draws and calling all their non-nut draws but i mean to be fair it's probably better to have draws in both of your ranges than not but you want to make sure you are to some extent mixing it up i know this is gonna be difficult to do in-game personally what i do i call a lot of the ones that have higher showdown value like ace jack like 10 8 for the pair and i raise the ones that lack showdown value and if you look at the gto strategy it kind of does that right like it's raising the weaker asex students raising the weaker king x suit it's raising the draws with straight outs that also lacks showdown value and it mostly calls the really bad draws and the generally higher equity draws that can improve to stuff like top pair or win unimproved let's take a look at one more spot deep stacked here lojack versus big blind flop comes ace jack five big blind checks button bets the third big blind calls turns in eight big blind checks okay this is a spot where the player on the low jack should be barreling very polarized right and notice when we are betting turn we're betting very big wouldn't be shocked if we're supposed to use an even bigger bet in this scenario take a look at the strategy that is or the hands that are betting it's going to be all the hands that are very likely good plus some bluffs so what are the bluffs in this spot well the bluffs are going to be hands that block the opponent's nuts right and whenever you block the nuts from your opponent the river nuts for your opponent like with king of spades 10 you can bet the turn if you get called you can just again continue betting very very big on the river so notice here we see how king of spades x plays they're king of spades 10 and king 10 of spades plays they're mostly betting using the big size right and um they're going to continue barreling on a lot of rivers whereas the king 10 with no spade is doing a whole lot of checking right you want to be able to block the opponent's auto calls on the river which will be flushes clearly and blocking a spade is very relevant also we see queen jack here betting this is queen jack of spades this is essentially being used as a high equity draw because when you blast the turn your opponent from a gto point of view should start folding out some weak aces so in this scenario you can bet and when you do get called sometimes you have the best hand but quite often you're getting your opponent to fold out a hand like a weaker ace which is also very powerful um notice stuff like 10 9 a very strong draw continues betting kind of interesting to see jack 10 and jack nine continuing to bet at this point these are essentially being used as bluffs to try to get your opponent off of the ace right kind of cool to see um notice a lot of the asex checking very clear marginal made hands here so we're betting very polarized and in this spot it's actually kind of hard to come up with logical draws right whenever it's kind of hard to come up with logical draws you start using stuff like middle pairs and bottom pairs that block some of your opponent's hands that will obviously call like two pairs right so pretty cool spots but as you see big bet sizes being used in these scenarios when they bet the flop and get called quite often the big bet sizes are what you're going to pull out again i want to recap the three main differences your stack off threshold is higher you need to have a hand with higher equity to happily get your money in as you get deeper and deeper this is going to result in a little bit more checking especially from out of position a little bit more folding from out of position and also using more polarized bets when you are betting right especially when you're in position you're usually going for big bet sizes because when you have the nuts you won't be able to get the money in the pot and if you're betting very polarized you get to include a lot of bluffs and also nut advantage matters very much as we get deeper and deeper and the ability to make the nuts and or block the nuts like we saw that king 10 with king of spades or tennis fades goes up in value so keep these three things in mind when you're playing deep stacked and besides these three things for the most part you play very similarly similarly to when you are playing 100 big blinds deep", metadata={'source': 'zLks89LtzDg', 'title': 'BIG EXPLOITS For DEEP STACKED Cash Games!', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 23708,

[Document(page_content="let's discuss post-flop strategy now i realize that post-flop play is a big big big topic and it may be overwhelming so i have a lot of quizzes and challenges at pokercoaching.com for you to go through i highly suggest you go to the earliest homework challenge and work your way forward because we're going to be discussing in depth how to play well post flop there for now i'm going to give you some in-depth concepts that you must understand that we'll heavily dictate your post slot play with some examples and that will do a great job of getting you started so when you get to the flop you always want to essentially ask should i bet or should i check and if i do bet how much do i bet and these two ideas are determined by three main concepts and they are range advantage nut advantage and position so the idea of range advantage is you compare your entire range that you get to a specific betting round with to your opponent's entire range and then you ask which range connects better with the flop let me give you an example so let's say under the gun raises and the big blind calls go ahead take a second visualize the under the gun range and visualize the big blinds range go back and reference them maybe have them printed out on your wall or they're on your phone in this scenario under the gun is going to have a range that i've typed here in equilab this is a free program you can download search equal lab and it'll come right up there's a that's for windows for mac i believe there's a program called poker cruncher maybe check that out so i've entered the under the gun players range right here okay this is the range that under the gun raises with now i've also entered the range that the big blind calls with this big blind calling range may be tighter or looser depending on the big blind strategy right think about your opponent's range and adjust it accordingly so now what you do is you type the board right here in the flop ace of spades king of spades jack of hearts and you click evaluate and then equlab is going to run this situation you know 30 million times and tell you how often or how much equity each hand has in general the what this actually means is not all that important but what you want to ask yourself is which range is favored and in this scenario 65 out of 100 total percent is a situation that heavily favors the under the gun range so on ace king jack under the gun has a ton of equity however let's say the exact same scenario under the gun raises big blind calls but now the flop is seven of eight six of spades five of diamonds with the exact same ranges now it's closer to 50 50. okay and you can actually run various scenarios i'll show you how you can practice this really quick just to get some examples of how much equity each range has in various spots you can let's say the board is jack of diamonds six of clubs six of spades you see you run it again you see the under the gun range is still a pretty hefty favorite let's say it is eight of hearts seven of hearts four of clubs you see now it's way closer to 50 50 right and doing this in various scenarios with various ranges will go a long way to helping you understand how different ranges interact with different flops we're gonna have some quizzes with this so you are actually gonna have to test yourself to make sure you know how to do this because this is an important concept so in general the player who has the range advantage is going to typically tell you how frequently you want to bet and you want to bet frequently when the flop favors your range and you want to check frequently when the flop favors your opponent's range so when your range has more than about 58 equity you're going to want to be betting very very very very frequently and you're going to want to be checking frequently when the flop favors your opponent's range now i say in this scenario when your opponent has or when you have 54 percent equity or less so that doesn't mean it necessarily heavily favors your opponent's range but you don't have any sort of substantial advantage that allows you just to bet with everything in your range we'll be discussing that a little bit more in depth so if that's um not fully understood or not fully explained we'll we'll get there because we have to put together range advantage nut advantage and position to come up with our strategy so let's discuss a few common board types that you will see typically as the pre-flop aggressor your range is going to contain all of the best hands whereas the pre-flop callers range usually will not contain the best hands because they would have three bet them right so if they just call your pre-flop raise it presumes they don't have aces kings queens ace king in their range anymore so you're gonna find that high cardboards heavily favor the pre-flop aggressor that's what this says which boards favor the pre-flop aggressor next on uncoordinated boards like queen five two let me go over here to show you this right i can type this in we do queen of spades five of clubs two of hearts you see we're still heavily favored as the stronger range let's say the board is seven of clubs four of hearts three of hearts you see here it's much closer right and as we have on this chart low cards boards somewhat favor the pre-flop aggressor not not a huge amount but somewhat and then the middle card boards we already showed back over here middle cardboards it's very close to 50 50. okay and these really are the common boards you'll find that there are some differences in various boards um you'll also find that as your opponent's reign chain range changes different boards will connect in different ways as a very quick example of that let's say instead of the big blind calling your raise let's say the player on the button calls your raise because now the player on the button is not going to have quite as much junk in their range right let's presume the player on the button maybe has just you know very very rough example let's say the player on the button is going to call with something like this let's just presume now let's change this board to let's say jack of clubs nine of hearts eight of hearts you see now that board is actually quite good for the player on the button and that makes logical sense because if you look at the way this boar or this range lines up with that board it makes sense right i mean on jack nine eight there's a lot of a lot of jacks in this range right a lot of jacks there's a lot of nines and there's some aids so makes sense and you want to go through and use a program like equilab to run and compare ranges against other ranges on various boards it's going to take some time it's going to take a little bit of effort but you do have to study a little bit to get good at poker that said this is the very basics and you know this is all you know you're going to be probably way better off than the majority of your opponents the next idea is nut advantage you want to determine who proportionally has more nut hands in their range and again a nut hand means the absolute best possible hands and when i say the nut hand i don't mean the one specific nut hand i mean effective nut hands like for example say the board is jack jack three any jack is the effective nuts all right so let's say in this scenario under the gun raises and the big blind calls take a second and think about who has more premium hands on ace king jack well let's take a look at the ranges here on ace king jack well all of these hands in this quadrant are really good right and also all these aces are pretty good actually all these kings and all these like queen 10 is really good right so you see the under the gun player almost every hand in their range is really strong besides pocket tens knives eight seven sixes and maybe like ten nine suited and even then ten nine suited may have a flush draw and it does have a straight draw right if it gets acquainted as a nut straight so in this scenario on ace king jack this heavily favors the under the gun player however what if the board comes 866 well take a second obviously this big blind range could be constructed in various ways it could be wider it could be looser it doesn't really matter let's just presume it is exactly this in this scenario in this scenario you see that there are lots of sixes available but under the gun has almost no sixes so on 866 while the big blind will i'm the under the gun player will have the range advantage they will lack the nut advantage and when you have the range advantage but lack the nut advantage you want to be betting frequently which is what your range advantage tells you but when you lack the nut advantage you want to be betting small so this is a scenario where when under the gun raises in big blind calls on 866 big blind's gonna check under the gun should then bet tiny like one and a half big blinds a really small bet because he has the range advantage but lacks the nut advantage all right in general as your range contains more premium hands you get to play more aggressively you get to apply more aggression so interestingly enough if you think about the big blind strategy in that exact scenario where big blind checks under the gun best 1.5 big blinds big blinds should now raise with all of their sixes or at least the majority of their sixes and also a lot of draws as a bluff so on eight six six what are draws well nine sevens to draw if they have it notice in the scenario 97 gets three bet but whatever they could have nine seven they could have stuff like seven five again that may get three bet in this scenario i hand like five four so uh gut shot straight draw if a seven comes in that's the gut shot um they have a straight that's a hand they can definitely raise if you have ten nine that can raise and like even jack nine jack 10 queen 9 these hands all could conceivably raise they're not good draws but they're very unlikely to be the best hand at the moment but if they have a backdoor flush draw meaning let's say it comes runner run or spade say the board is eight of spades six of clubs six of hearts if two more spades come and you have queen nine of spades you made a flush of two spades come so those are all hands that you may want to be playing aggressively so as your range contains more effective nut hands you get to play more and more aggressively finally position is very important you typically get to bet more from in position and you should be checking more from out of position that's because when you're in position you have a lot of control over the size of the pot so when you are out of position you don't really want to be betting and raising too often because that will put you in difficult spots if the player in position decides to raise you or re-raise them so let's say you raise from the hijack and then someone yet that calls you should be continuation betting that's when you make a bet on the flop as the aggressor on the previous betting round you should be continuation betting more often against a caller from the big blind and you should be checking more often against the player and the cut off on all boards so when you're at a position you typically want to be doing more checking in position you want to be doing a little bit more betting sorry to interrupt but i do hope you're enjoying this sneak preview of my mastering the fundamentals course this entire course will teach you everything you need to know to crush the small stakes games and for making it this far in this video i'm going to give you the entire course for free all you have to do to get it is head over to pokercoaching.com fundamentalscourse right now all right let's get back to learning about how to crush post flop poker now that you understand range advantage nut advantage and position and how they impact your post flop strategy let's apply that to specifically the flop so when you have the range advantage this is when you have 58 percent of a range advantage or more we have 58 or more equity as we showed in the previous section in this scenario you're just going to want to bet very very very very frequently it is fine to bet small about one-third pot with your entire range this is something very different than what a lot of recreational players do where they will only bet when they connect with the board if they make a pair they'll bet if they make some sort of a draw they will bet but if they miss they'll just check and that is a big mistake so if you wanted a really simple strategy that you could very easily follow and it wouldn't be too far off from the perfect strategy you can just make a small continuation bet on every flop when you have the range advantage remember you have the range advantage by going through and practicing and studying with a program like equilab if you do want to take this strategy and ramp it up a little bit you should bet larger about three-fourths of the size of the pot when your opponent's continuing range contains mostly decently strong hands so what i mean by that is let's go back to this example from the previous section and take a look at this situation where under the gun raises and the big blind calls flop comes ace king jack if you think about this we already know that the under the um player has a big equity advantage so you're going to be betting with every single hand in your range however if you think about the hands in the big blinds range that will continue if you if you make a bet you see all these aces here ace jack to ace two they're gonna call if you bet three fourths pot no one's folding top pair to a three four spot bats but if they have a king they're not gonna fold to a three-fourths pop bat but what if they have like eight five off suit or eight five ace five eight five without a draw or seven four without a draw they're just gonna fold every time right so in this scenario you want to be betting big and frequently you're going to find usually when you're betting big and frequently it's also because you have the nut advantage as well and on this board remember under the gun does have a huge nut advantage because they have pocket aces pocket kings pocket jacks ace king whereas the player and the big blind does not have those hands okay um it is also worth mentioning that you will essentially never have the range advantage as the pre-flop caller from the big blind because your range is going to be significantly weaker than the pre-flop razors because you were in the big blind and you only had to put in a small amount of money before the flop to call and see the flop and you would have re-raised with your best hands so as we showed in this situation even on this flop 765 which is actually the best flop for the player in the big blind you see against the under the gun range you still are at a tiny disadvantage and so for that reason you will not have the range advantage from the big blind so the big blind should essentially always check to the pre-flop aggressor this is also very different than what a lot of recreational players do they will bet into the pre-flop razor but that is a substantial mistake unless of course you're trying to adjust to take advantage of something your opponent does very wrong like say your opponent's always going to fold unless they have top pair or better then yeah you should bat into them every time because they're going to fold way way too often so very simply though when you have the range advantage just bet frequently and you can't really go wrong it gets a little bit more difficult though when you do not have the range advantage as the aggressor because now you should not be betting every time this is when you have less than 58 equity when you run your range against your opponent's range and it's even more so as it gets closer to 50 50. so now you're going to want to break your entire range down into one of four categories you're either gonna have premium made hands draws marginal made hands and junk this is going to get a little bit advanced but if you want a ton of experience and practice doing this head over to pokercoaching.com in the challenge section there i have many many many many many challenges that will force you to do this to ensure you know how to do this well at the table i've had a lot of students who've come to me and not even under like knew about this concept and now they are applying this when they're playing and they are crushing the game so go there and study all right so your premium made hands these are just your absolute best hands so this is going to be usually something like the nuts all the way down to strong top pair hands these hands you're pretty much always going to want to be betting with betting in all scenarios and that's because you just want to win a big pot you have the best hand and you want to get money in the pot when you have the best hand don't get fancy and do what's called slow playing where you check a lot of your best hands hoping your opponent's bet because you know they're not always going to bet and even when they do if you check and they bet and then you raise them well you just announced haha gotcha and then they get to fold right so this is a situation where you want to be betting with your best mate hands when you're betting with your best mate hands so you also want to make sure that you're betting with some bluffs and the best bluffs to bet with are your draws and that's because you're betting your draws essentially as a semi bluff it is not the best hand at the moment but it's very likely the best hand if you improve to whatever draw you have so let's say you raise big blind calls flop comes 983 this is a board you should not be betting every single time because the range advantage is going to be kind of close right it's going to be closer to 50 50. so in this spot the when your opponent checks in the big blind you should be betting with your hands like your over pairs like aces kings queens jax tens your three of a kinds your pocket knights pocket eights pocket threes your nine eights for two pairs but then also a bunch of draws like jack 10 queen jack 10 7 suited if you have it so you'll be betting with your best mate hands and your draws that way your opponent will not know if you have one of your best made hands or a draw and that puts them in a difficult spot they're in a guessing game right and you're going to find that draws is a difficult category to really nail down because on a very uncoordinated board a draw may be a backdoor straight draw with a backdoor flush draw meaning you need uh you need to come runner runner you need to turn in the river to be perfect for you to get there but on a very coordinated board like 876 you'll have a lot of draws available so you can be a little bit more selective and bet with mostly the very strong draws next your marginal made hands these are hands that generally just want to cheaply get to the showdown meaning you want to be able to get to the showdown turn your hand up and just hope to win because if a little bit of money goes in the pot you're going to be in good shape but if a lot of money goes in the pot maybe not these are usually going to be hands like marginal top pairs top pair marginal kicker all the way down to hand like strong ace high and then your junk your junk is just very very bad hands that are no good so if you raise pre-flop you completely miss the flop it's usually fine to check so when you lack the range advantage as the pre-flop aggressor you want to be betting your best-made hands in your draws and you want to be checking your marginal made hands and your junk okay that is exactly what you do in these scenarios if you do this you may not be playing the absolute most perfect poker possible but it's going to be pretty close and way better than what the vast majority of your opponents are doing so let's take a look at two examples okay so here we have jack tennis spades this is definitely a hand we want to raise again consult the pre-flop charts if you're not sure we raise the player on the button calls and we see the flop so flop comes queen nine two okay so take a second think about this do we have a premium made hand well no we have jack hi do we have a marginal made hand no do we have junk no but we do have a draw because if we get a king or an eight we have the nuts we have the best possible hand if it comes two spades we're gonna have a flush which is also very good and if we get a jack or a 10 that's also good enough so we're going to be betting here with our marginal made hand so we do bet in this situation it is worth mentioning when you're betting infrequently you want to be betting using a slightly larger size so when we're betting very frequently we're using a third pop bat for the most part when we're betting infrequently we're going to want to be betting bigger and that's because our bedding range is polarized when your betting range is polarized either the absolute best hands like king queen and better or your range is relatively weak like a draw you're going to want to be using a big bet size so in this scenario we do bet 10 and the player on the button calls okay on the turn we get a three again categorize your hand take a second think about it do we have a premium made hand a draw a marginal made hand or junk at this point we still have a pretty good draw if we get there on the river with a um with a king or an eight we're very happy if we get a jacker 10 we're happy enough so we're going to continue betting in this scenario so we do keep betting again you're going to want to use a relatively big size i'm not going to go to the river and discuss that yet we will be discussing river strategy later when we get to that part of this course but i do want to make it clear on the flop this is what we are definitely trying to hammer home here premium made hand draw marginal made hand or junk and when you have a draw with eight outs to the nuts this is a really good drawing hand to just bet so you want to be betting here using a relatively big size let's take a look at another scenario where we have queen 10 of spades we raise it up player on the button calls again flop comes queen nine two so in this situation we have what is a very clear made hand right top pairs of made hand the question is is this premium made hand or a marginal made hand and this hand is actually right on the cusp so for that reason you can either bet or check either play is fine always ask yourself what does my opponent do wrong let's say you know if you check the flop your opponent will bet the flop essentially every time which some people will if that's the case this is a great hand to check because we want to check and let our opponent bluff a lot however if your opponent is going to check behind with a lot of hands and they're not going to be bluffing all that often you'd rather just go ahead and bet this hand yourself so remember always adjust for what your opponent does incorrectly this time we do decide to bet we do use a relatively large size because remember we're betting slightly and frequently in this scenario if my hand was much worse like queen eight suited or a pair of jacks or ace nine i would definitely check by the way so we do bet the opponent calls on the turn we now have to ask well our opponent called our flop bit so they probably have something should we keep betting and um it's close but in this scenario i think checking is actually very fine and when we check this hand this has now been essentially downgraded from a premium made hand to a marginal made hand once you've been our opponent calls because when they call your flop bet they fold out all of their junk right if they did have a hand like eight seven they're going to fold or if they have ace 10 they're going to fold so when they call your flop bit they have something so when they have something they usually could have ace queen king queen queen jack that we lose to but they could also have some marginal stuff like 9 8 or they could have king jack for a straight draw they decided to call that may start bluffing if we check the turn so now we're going to check and when we check this hand we already know we're just not really looking to fold this hand this is one of the best marginal made hands we could have so we're gonna check and then once our opponent bets we're gonna call and this is a very different strategy than what a lot of recreational players use they instead bet the flop and bet the turn and bet the river but when that happens what your opponent is going to end up folding out all of their marginal hands that you beat and they're going to call with all of the better hands that you lose to and that's actually a horrible result so you want to make sure that you do have some decently strong hands in your checking range so that when you check you're not just folding every time your opponent bets imagine how easy poker would be if every time your opponent checks they're going to fold if you bet and every time they bet they're betting because they have a good hand well that's actually how a lot of small stakes players play and that's why the small 6 games are incredibly profitable and really the flop and the turn are not all that different whenever you have the range advantage and the nut advantage you're going to want to continue betting when you don't you're going to mostly want to check whenever you lack the range advantage you're going to be betting with only your best mate hands and your draws the difference though is that once your opponent or you make it through the flop you are both going to have different ranges right for example if you bet on an uncoordinated flop as the pre-flop razor you're going to have your entire range for the most part because you're going to continuation with almost everything however your opponent when they check call you on the flop is now not going to have their entire range because if they had nothing on the flop they're just going to fold so their range gets stronger so in general you're going to find that ranges start to be closer to 50 50 on the turn which leads to essentially more polarized betting where the bettors are betting with their best made hands in their drawers and they're checking with their marginal made hands and their junk there are eight examples i'm going to be going through here i realize they are somewhat in depth so take it slow if you need to pause and rewind feel free to do that also make sure you check out the challenges at pokercoaching.com there we go through many in-depth examples where i have you actually visualize and explain how you're going to play every single hand in your range and that's going to go a long way to helping you fully understand how to play the turn so this first scenario is when there is a bet and a call on an uncoordinated flop so when the pre-flop razor raises someone calls the pre-flop razor bets the flop and the other person calls in this scenario on an uncoordinated flop if you think back to the flop section the flop better should actually have almost their entire range so their range doesn't get narrowed all that much when they bet the flop because they should be betting with basically everything but the caller's range gets stronger because the caller is going to fold out the bottom portion of their range to the flop bet so if the flop better presumably had a range advantage on the flop once they bet and get called now the ranges get much closer in strength so the person who bets the flop will often end up checking the turn so let's take a look at this example here we have a situation where we raised with the jack ten of spades the big blind calls flop becomes ace eight four this is a scenario where the big mind is going to check every time and the pre-flop razor should continuation bet pretty much every time especially with hands that lack showdown value but could get a good turn card that will allow them to keep bluffing with their draws right so jack ten of spades is a hand here that if we bet in our opponent folds that's great if we bet and they call if the turn brings any spade a queen a king a nine a seven all of those cards are pretty good for the hijack to continue betting especially with this hand because that will give this jack 10 a draw right so we're going to bet small and frequently on this board the opponent calls turn is a two of hearts so this is not really what we were looking for because if you think about the big blinds range when they check call to flop they're gonna have a whole lot of pairs right and you know perhaps some draws but it's gonna be mostly pairs and when the turn brings a complete blank like a two well now the opponent's gonna be way less likely to fold any of those pairs if the turn was a two of spades we would keep betting with this jack ten of spades because we have a flush draw then but with no flusher on this spot it's probably fine just to give up realize it's going to go check check and if the opponent bets the river we're just going to fold and that's how this is going to go a lot of the time we did not turn additional equity and remember you want to be betting with your best made hands and your draws when the ranges are roughly equal which is pretty much where we'll be when we bet the flop and our opponent calls because we have our entire range and our opponent does not have the bottom of their range that they get to the flop with because they would have folded it to the flop bet all right let's take a look at another scenario where it goes check check on an uncoordinated flop so i just mentioned here that the pre-flop razor should be betting very frequently on an uncoordinated flop but they will occasionally check and when they do check it's usually with a very obvious marginal made hand this is going to be like a strong underpair or top pair bad kicker a hand that can easily go check check on the flop call any turn bet then call any river bat right so this is a situation where when it goes check check if the caller is out of position meaning i raise from any position and the big blind calls they're going to check the flop every time right and then i'm going to bet most the time but this time i check realize that when the player in the big blind checks they could still have their whole range right because they're not going to bet with anything so they have their entire range going to the turn however the better still has mostly decently strong marginal made hands which actually puts the outer position collar in pretty bad shape this is different though if the caller is in position because imagine i raised from middle position like the hijack seat or the low jack seat and button calls now if i check the flop and they check behind you have to presume they don't have their best hands and they also won't have too many draws because most people whenever they get checked two will bet their best made hands in the draw so you see that even though it goes check check the opponent's position is actually kind of important in the scenario because it dictates what type of range they will have so let's take a look at an example and you try to think as we go through what type of range the opponent is likely to have so here we raise with a spore of hearts and the big blind calls flop comes ace eight two and it goes check check this is a spot where the hijack could certainly bet this hand but if you do want to check some hands hands like ace four are fine to check hands like pocket kings are fine to check so it does go check check and right now before we even start even see what the big blind does try to think about what their range looks like well their range probably looks like their entire preflop calling range which is going to be really wide and the nice thing about letting it go check check on the flop with this ace4 is that ace4 actually crushes a really wide range because our opponent's going to be in this pot in the big blind with all sorts of unpaired hands right and you know middle pair type hands which chase four beats so this is a situation where now if the opponent bets the turn we're gonna call every time because we don't have a premium made hand here we have a marginal made hand so we're gonna call with our marginal made hands if somehow we did have a premium made hand like so we had pocket tens we would raise if i somehow had a draw like i don't even know what draws i could have here let's say i had like king king five of hearts i mean i don't even think i would raise that but that would be a hand that where raising does at least have some merit because we have a draw right but this is a situation where with my ace four even if it was not ace four the flush draw i would definitely just call the turnback fat ace four of diamonds for example i would call the turn bat and then if the opponent bent the river i would also call and this is a situation where our hand in most people's eyes looks way weaker than it actually is and when your hand looks way weaker than it actually is you just do not need to fold all that often unless of course you know something about your opponent's strategy and you adjust accordingly remember if you know your opponent does something wrong like perhaps never bluffs the river if you know for a fact your opponent's never bluffing the river and he has an ace or better every time well we actually lose to all the aces right so we should fold this hand but that's not gonna be the case against most people so we have an easy call and um you know the opponent had a reasonable hand to play this way right they called our pre-flop waves with six five of hearts which is fine they um went check check on the flop they probably were just gonna fold if we bet but we didn't so we kept them in with a hand that was drawing really thin which means they were basically never gonna win on the turn they turned a flush draw so they bet that makes sense then on the river they have one of the worst hands they can have and when you have one of the worst hands you can have on the river there's often merit and bluffing with it so our opponent bluffed with it and we called and we ended up winning a decent pot in the spot where a lot of people don't win the pop because they just bet the flop and their opponent folds right so we end up winning more money in this scenario by playing this hand in this manner and that's often what will end up happening in that case all right now let's discuss when it goes check bet call on the flop so in this scenario whether or not the check caller is in or out of position well to be fair so say say the uh we raised from the hijack seat and the big blind calls if they check we continuation at the flop and they call the check caller usually does not have their best hands same logic goes if we raise from the hijack seat and the button calls if we check the flop they bet and we call we also probably lack our best hands because we would have bet them ourselves right so the check caller is usually going to lack their made hands and an uncoordinated flop the flop better should have you know mostly premium made hands and draws due to being against mostly marginal made hands when the checker is the pre-flop razor some important point here so this point applies to in or out of position this point here applies to only when the pre-flop razor checks the flop because when the pre-flop razor checks the flop on an uncoordinated board remember they should have mostly marginal made hands which means if the person in position is betting they probably have a good made hand or a draw and in that situation the flop better will often keep betting the turn because they have either a really good main hand that wants to put money in or a draw that doesn't mind if the opponent falls so let's take a look at that spot here he raised jack 10 of spades the player on the button calls flop comes queen jack 3. this is a situation where if you think about the ranges and how they line up or if you want to use equal lab like we discussed earlier you'll see that if the player on the button is reasonable they're going to have a lot of big cards middle pairs suited connected type hands and that actually connects pretty well with queen jack 3. so we in the hijack seat as the pre-flop razor need to do a lot of checking and we're going to check calling our medium strength hands perhaps check raising with our best hands but when we do check call we probably have a medium strength hand which we do right the turn is an ace we're just going to check again and now the opponent keeps betting and this is a pretty tough spot because if you think about the player on the buttons range he could easily have king 10 right especially king 10 suited he could also easily have ace queen ace jack ace three suited he'd have all of those um he could have a hand like ten nine that's a hand that would keep bluffing so you know we are going to fold the best hand every once in a while the bun could also just have like a random bluff like eight seven of clubs and decide to keep bluffing on the ace turn but despite all of that i think we probably just want to make a snug fold at this point unless you know your opponent is overly loose and overly aggressive so we do fold in this scenario and turns out the opponent did just decide to bluff the flop with the ace high but got there on the turn and we end up you know sidestepping a spot where we lose it's important to realize that on this queen jack 3 flop we're actually in okay shape when we check the flop with the jack 10 but when that ace comes that's just very very bad for my hand to the point that we're done with it all right so that's how we play on uncoordinated flops what about coordinated flops so now let's say that we raise pre-flop the opponent calls from out of position they check the flop we bet in this situation on a coordinated flop remember we are going to be doing more checking mainly with our marginal made hands and our junk so when we do bet the flop we probably have one of our best-made hands and or a draw right and the caller's range is going to again strengthen because they fold out the bottom portion of their range this is going to make ranges closer in terms of range advantage but the flop bettors often going to keep betting on the turn in these scenarios because they have either a really good made hand or a draw whereas the opponent has mostly marginal made hands so let's take a look at an example of this here we raise jack ten of spades big blind calls flop comes nine seven six two clubs so now when the opponent checks we want to ask which hands do we want to be betting on this coordinated board and this board should connect very very well with the big blind right big blind has a lot of medium cards so if the player in the hijack the initial razer is betting here it needs to be with the best made hands mostly over pairs three of a kind two pair and some draws and the obvious draws here are flush draws hands with an eight but really we don't have too many hands with an eight besides like ace eight and maybe king eight both both suited um we could bet with also some hands with a ten that have over cards that would be mainly king 10 queen 10 jack 10 and our hand's particularly nice because if we get a spade on the turn we can pretty confidently continue betting and if we get a club on the turn to be fair we can also keep bluffing as if we have the clubs so this is a spot where i'm going to be betting this hand this hand does not win at the showdown all that often which is a good reason to turn into a bluff if it also will win sometimes when it makes a very very strong hand so i definitely like betting the flop here and the opponent calls and notice when i'm betting here my range is going to be draws that want the opponent to fold but also the good made hands that don't really care if the opponent calls turns an ace the opponent checks we're definitely going to keep betting here even though the ace is not good for my hand it actually is not so bad for my range because if i had one of those strong hands already three of a kind or two pair i'm still pretty happy i'm just going to keep betting and if i have a draw some of those are going to be the ace high flush draw which is fine they just made top pair some of those are going to be maybe like ace two of spades that bet the flop and just made top pair as well so those want to keep betting so this is a nice spot to continue betting with our draws that also did not hit so we're gonna bet the turn here and if the opponent does call we're just probably going to keep betting the river with this hand the majority of the time so i like this scenario um that's a pretty nice spot that illustrates where we are going to have either a really good made hand or a draw and in those cases you just want to keep betting if we did bet with a hand like pocket tens or pocket kings on the flop i would probably check behind on the turn because now we went from a pretty strong maid hand on the flop to a marginal made hand and then we're going to fold if the opponent i'm sorry we're going to call if the opponent bets the river because now our hand looks much weaker than it actually is right you're going to find that whenever you do check behind on the turn with a marginal made hand the plan is often to call a river bet and do realize that whenever you bet the flop with a premium hand but the turn is quite bad for it it gets downgraded to a marginal hand and with your marginal hands you check right all right what about when it goes check check on a coordinated flop so now typically both players would bet with their best made hands in their draws if you raise in the caller is in position however if the caller is out of position they could still have their entire range right so realize that when the caller is in position that's going to result in it going check check on the turn a lot because both players are going to have mostly marginal made hands or junk so it's a situation where it's kind of dicey to know exactly what both players have because on the coordinated boards both players have to be kind of cautious with their strong but non-nut made hands when the caller is in position right so this is a situation where the in position player can start to bet their strong marginal made hands on the turn if it does go check check on the flop but both players should proceed cautiously so let's take a look here we raise jack 10 of spades this is going to be an example against the outer position player they check the flop it goes check check notice here the opponent could have all sorts of um well their whole range right and whenever we check behind the jack tennis spades here we know we're just gonna be calling a turn bet on basically every turn because we have a very clear marginal made hand this time though the turn is bad for us right we still have our medium pair with our middle pair which is good so we're just going to go check check again because if i bet and my opponent calls or raises that's really bad right you can often ask yourself if i bet and get raised would it be terrible and if it would be terrible then checking often makes sense when you have a decent hand that can win at the showdown river goes check and now we've decided if we should put in a small value bet when you are betting on the river with a very marginal made hand that you are trying to get called by a worse marginal maiden you very frequently want to use a small bet size and that's what we do in the scenario we do use a small bet size and we're trying to get called by a nine or a seven which is perhaps even optimistic and the spot if you don't think your opponent will call with a nine or a seven but we'll always call the ten which you mostly lose to or an ace which you lose to then you shouldn't even bet the river even though we probably have the best hand so realize that just because you probably have the best hand does not mean you should always value bet you want to make sure that you can bet and get called by a decent amount of worse hands okay what about when it goes check bet call on a coordinated flop so this is when we raise someone in position calls we check the flop as we will do frequently on a coordinated board they bet and we call so in this scenario the flop better should again have their best made hands in their draws and the flop caller should have mostly marginal made hands and um that's a common scenario where the flop better should again continue betting on the turn a lot of the time so here we raise cut off calls flop comes ace queen four this is a pretty coordinated board that should connect well with the cutoff and also we have a very clear marginal made hand with our middle pair so we're gonna check call turns to five we're gonna check the opponent keeps betting this is a situation that is definitely dicey and i realize i'm showing you a few dicey spots where we are out of position but they don't always go this way right very often it's going to go check bet call on the flop and opponent just checks down and we end up winning with our king queen also realize i'm going to check the flop with some of my weak aces like ace six suited or he's too suited and the plan is to check call flop and check call turn and check call river so we're not always just losing these scenarios and this spot though i think calling is actually fine because they're actu there are a decent amount of draws available right here if the opponent did have um seven six of clubs and they decided to take a stab at the flop now they are gonna feel at least somewhat inclined to keep bluffing on the turn say they had um king nine of spades or nine eight of spades they would definitely bet those on the flop and they would keep betting on the turn so even though we do lose to all of the better made hands we do beat some bluffs and there actually are a pretty good amount of bluffs rivers and nine we check and the opponent bets again this is kind of a dicey spot now if i did have an ace i would call remember how i said if i had ace two i would check call flop check alternate check call river this is a spot where i would do that with my king queen though i think folding is probably fine if a spade came in i would definitely fold if um like an 8 came and it's particularly bad because 7 6 gets there if you know your opponent is a little bit overly aggressive i think calling is actually fine it's not a great spot to call but it's probably okay in this scenario though i think folding in general is fine because we lose to all the strong aces that we keep betting right and if we play our range intelligently are we're going to be able to check call a lot with the slightly better hands when we have an ace this time though the opponent did bet with jack ten of spades and they make us fold the best hand and that's gonna happen realize that you're gonna fold the best hand sometimes that is part of poker and i think our opponent played the hand well right they should definitely call our pre-flop rays they should definitely bet the flop with their obvious draw they should definitely bet the term of their obvious draw and they should definitely bluff the river with the jack high we'll be discussing river strategy in just a minute but you will see that you need to be bluffing with hands that cannot win at the showdown right okay now let's take a look at a spot when there is a flop raise pretty much no matter who raises on the flop the razor will usually have their absolute best made hands and some amount of draws and the caller will usually be lacking their best made hands because they will usually re-raise them but some people will just call the flop raise with their entire range which makes them much more difficult to play against in general let's take a look at an example of this we raise jack ten of spades player on the button calls flop comes jack eight three we continuation bet the flop we could also check here by the way i think if we check call flop check call turn check call river that is perfectly viable um if the river is a particularly bad card or the turn's a particularly bad card like a queen of hearts or a seven of hearts or a king of hearts those are those are cards where we may end up making a snug fold if we do check call the flop but this time we decide to bet and we get raised so right off the bat i think this would be way too strong of a hand to fold because there are actually a pretty good amount of turns that are fine for us right a 10 is fine a jack is fine a spade is fine i do realize we could be losing against and that has us in really bad shape like pocket eights or pocket threes but that's not gonna happen all that often if you are playing in games where you know your opponents are especially weak and they only raise with really good hands like maybe ace jack or better in this scenario then you should just make a early fold right but against players who are raising a decent amount of time who are in there battling a bit you can't fold in this spot it's just a little bit too tight so we do call turns a complete blank for us it doesn't help us at all we check the opponent keeps betting using a kind of big bet size which means they should have either a good made hand or a draw and i think in general you're gonna find that in most small snakes games or casual games that you're likely to play you just need to fold in the spot and we do fold and it turns out we're actually in very very bad shape this time and we end up not losing a lot of money what a lot of people do wrong in this spot is they'll call the flop raise call the turn bet and then call a riverbat and that's a pretty big mistake next let's talk about multi-way when there was a flop better no matter who the better was usually the better as it gets more more multi-way on the flop will have their premium made hands and their draws and the callers or caller will usually lack their premium made hands because they would have raised them right so the flop better should usually keep betting with their best made hands in their draws but when they do get called on the flop some of their strong hands like top pair pretty good kicker may become a marginal made hand right that's typically how this is going to go if it turns a complete blank the flop better will keep betting with their best hands but if the turn is a little bit scary the flop better is going to do a decent amount of checking so let's take a look at a spot we raise it up get multiple callers flop comes jack 10 4. it's a really good flop for me but obviously we have to worry about getting out drawn here so we're going to be betting this hand we do use a big size because there are lots of draws available in general when you're betting with a strong made hand if there are lots of draws available you want to use a bigger size and multi-way when you're betting you're usually going to be betting less frequently and when you're betting less frequently you often often want to use a bigger size if you're about 20 get two callers and right now you want to ask yourself what did the caller's ranges look like and if you think about this both of these players are going to have a decent amount of pretty good made hands like a jack or a 10 or a bunch of draws and there are a lot of draws available so which cards do we really not want to see on the turn well an ace of diamonds is bad a king of diamonds queen of diamonds nine of diamonds eight of diamonds seven of diamonds all those are really bad because some straight draws get there and flush draws get there something like a seven of clubs is fine enough we do lose to one of the obvious draws nine eight but we also still beat a lot of the flush draw so we'll probably just keep betting there if it's a low card that doesn't complete a flush we're really happy so that's that's normally what we're thinking going to this turn turns to a clubs which is great we're just going to keep betting we're very happy again we want to use a pretty big size because we have what is almost certainly the best hand and if our opponents do have draws we don't want to let them see the river card for a cheap amount we bet and they both call again so again at this point which cars do not want to see on the river well pretty much the same ones we didn't want to see on the flop huh the rivers are nine of diamonds what a bummer so now ask yourself what would you do in this scenario the pots 265 and you have 114 left what a lot of people do in this spot is they go all in but i think that's actually a big mistake because now thinking about the hands the opponents likely have if they have a hand like ace jack or king jack or queen jack and we check to them they're just gonna check because they realize if they bet and get called it's probably gonna be by a flush or two pair or three of a kind or straight right so if it goes check check check on the river we actually win this pop very very often but if we check and someone bets now we almost certainly lose because our opponents have a whole lot of flushes available or king queen for a straight so we're just gonna check fold here i know it may seem a little bit um tight especially if you're not used to making seemingly big folds but it's important to realize that hands change in value as you're more likely to be against um you know better made hands usually two pairs good but not when you're against two players and there's a straight and a flush available and your opponents could very easily have those hands this is a spot where we just have a pretty easy fold and uh turns out this guy did have one of the drawers right king of diamonds he called the flop bet called the turn bet got there on the river and we didn't pay him and the fact that we did not pay him is going to result in us winning a lot more money in the long run because a lot of people lose 114 on this river and that's just completely unnecessary we need instead should lose zero now let's talk about um when there was not a bet on the flop now the ranges will lack some made hands and some draws so okay now let's discuss when there was not a flop better in a multi-way pot so now the ranges will lack premium made hands and draws because most people would bet with their premium made hands and their draws perhaps the only exception of this is the players and the blinds because they may check to the pre-flop razor but usually most people are gonna be lacking their best made hands in their draws so on the turn when we get there you do want to go ahead and bet with whatever the best made hands in your range are as well as whatever draws you have that became draws on the turn also if everyone checks you in position on the turn and it's clear they don't like their hands this is a spot where you can actually start bluffing a decent amount because when everyone checks you multiple times they probably don't have anything all that good let's take a look at an example of this we raise get a few callers flop comes queen jack four we have a very clear marginal made hand if we check hijack bets and the button calls i'm just gonna fold immediately because i'm very likely to be against a premium made hand or a draw if i check in one player bets i'm probably going to call this time it goes check check check though and the turn is now a 2. so we want to ask is this one of the best made hands we have in our range and it's close but probably not because i would definitely check some queens on the flop again you want to be checking your top pair marginal kickers maybe even top pair top kickers if you think the people you have to act are going to bet very frequently if you check to them so this is a spot where i think i'm just going to keep checking and if someone bets i'm going to call this time it goes check check check again rivers nate ask yourself again is this one of the best made hands in my range or a hand that completely cannot win at the showdown and no if it goes check check again i actually win a lot of the time with my middle pair but if i bet and get called i'm not really loving it so this is a nice spot to check so i do check hijack bets 13 and the button folds so this is a spot where unless you know the player in the hijack is a very straightforward and weak player to the point they're only betting with really good hands um you should probably call because at this point a lot of people will try to bluff and pick up these pots with hands that they don't think can win in the showdown so this is a pretty nice spot to just check and then call with our jack 10 and yeah we're going to lose a decent amount of the time here but given the way this hand is played out it's kind of unlikely the hijack has a queen because he probably better queen on the flop and if he didn't bet it on the flop he'd probably bet it on the turn he may show up with a random hand like a heart flush that decided not to bet the turn but this is a fine spot to call and you know we're not winning a ton of money by calling here but we are winning money in the long run and if you make plays that win money in the long run well you'll win in the long run and um this time he was bluffing so good so i know we've gone through a lot of hands on the turn but hopefully now have a clear idea of how ranges change based on the actions that are taken and realize that poker is a puzzle and you have to ask yourself what do the actions my opponents take mean for their range at this point in time and also what do my actions mean right and if you can put this puzzle together better than your opponents you will win in the long run and every time you play a hand consistently put your opponents on ranges that's going to go a long way to helping you become a much stronger poker player now that we made it through the flop and the turn let's discuss the river it's important to realize that the river is unique it is different than the flop and the term because now you either have the best hand or you don't because all of your draws will no longer have the chance to improve right so either you have the best hand every time or you don't and when this is the case it should lead you to bedding with mostly hands that are best when you bet and get called at the showdown which are going to be mostly your very strong made hands plus some amount of bluffs and we could go deep in terms of the math on how frequently you should be bluffing but we discussed that thoroughly in both my tournament master class and cash game masterclass so check that out for now though just realize that whenever you bet small with your strong but still kind of marginal hands it's going to be stuff like top pair medium kicker and whatnot you want to use relatively few bluffs and when you're betting large which is what you want to do with your premium made hands you want to use a larger portion of bluffs when you do happen to find yourself multi-way on the river you definitely want to consider who has the range and the nut advantage because some players will have a lot of nut hands in their range and some players will have almost none so definitely consider that when a lot of draw is complete definitely check your non-nut made hands and when the draws do complete and you have a busted draw you should strongly consider bluffing it with your bluffing it yourself on the river whenever there is a bet and a call in a multi-way pot you want to overcall which is when you are the third caller you want to overcall very tightly because whenever the first player bets they could still have a decent amount of blocks but when the second player calls they must have something pretty good because well they're not calling with like the nut low right and also they have to worry about you and the pot right because you as the player you had to act could still have a good hand so when it goes bet and call on the river if someone in that scenario you need to call behind very very tightly every once in a while you'll find that you get raised on the river this will not happen too often but in most small stakes games unless you know your opponent is a strong player who is very capable of bluffing you should typically assume that they have a premium hand this is when on the river you bet they raise you or they check you bet and they raise you they have something pretty good and usually very good unless you know them to be a lunatic so in this scenario do not call with marginal made hands that is a big big big mistake that will result in you losing tons of money so let's take a look at a few examples of some hands that we play all the way to the river and discuss my thoughts throughout kyrie raids with ace four of hearts big blind calls flop comes ace eight two this is that scenario again where we should be betting very frequently but if we are going to check i can already tell you that the plan is to check behind the flop call any turn bat on any card and call any river bet on any card unless i know my opponent to be the weakest tightest player in the world so check check on the flop opponent bets a turn do i have a premium made hand a draw a marginal made hand or a junk right it's always what you want to be asking yourself in this scenario we actually have a premium made hand and a draw but whenever you have a made hand either premium made hand or marginal made hand and a draw usually the made hand component of your hand is going to override your decision you may think i have a draw so i should raise but uh no actually in this scenario we're most likely going to have a marginal maid hand by the river so we just want to be calling right this is a spot where we want to call the term because we have a marginal made hand and we're going to call the river this is a strong marginal made hand but it's still marginal so we're going to call the turn if the opponent bets the river we still call and we win the pot right notice in this scenario we actually could be beat some portion of the time if the opponent did have a hand like um well ace nine opponent may bet the turn in the river and we call and we lose and that's going to happen and that is okay realize you don't have to win the pot every single time you call on the river a lot of people make the big mistake of only calling the river when they know they have the best hand or when they're like really really confident about it and that results in them folding way too often and if you fold way too often in these spots you just lose small amounts of money to your opponents who are a little bit loose and aggressive let's take a look at another hand here we have jack ten of spades we raise it up big blind calls flop comes nine seven six okay we know immediately on these coordinated boards we want to be doing a lot of checking but we want to bet with our best made hands and our draws is this a draw well yes it is right we have a gut shot straight draw two over cards and a back door flush draw a backdoor flush draw means we need two more spades to come which doesn't happen all that often so in this scenario when our opponent checks we are going to go ahead and bet so we do bet the opponent calls turns an ace this is a very good card to keep betting because if you think about our opponent's check calling range it's gonna be a whole lot of one pair hands they could be ace 9 a7 or a6 but it's also going to be a whole lot of king 9 king 7 king 6 queen 9 queen 7 queen 6 right and these hands just got way worse so this is definitely a spot to keep bluffing with a hand that is still a draw it's a weak draw but it's a draw we should keep betting so we do bet opponent calls river is now the king of spades and this is actually a kind of dicey card because our opponent could very easily have king 9 king 7 king 6 or a sign a7 a6 but they could also have a lot of hands like 9 8 8 7 8 6 right they can have a hand like queen 8 that is queen high that we really want to bluff out they could have um a lot of really just a lot of marginal one-pair hands they decided to call to turn also some players even if they have a hand like ace two of clubs they would check call the flop they'll check call to turn if you bet big on the river they'll actually fold that because if you think about it from our opponent's point of view i'm betting the flop using a kind of big size i'm betting the turn using a kind of big size and then i'm betting the river i'm going to use a kind of big size and that's gonna put our opponent in a really really tough spot so this is a situation where we definitely need to bet we have a hand that cannot win at the showdown when you cannot win in the showdown you probably want to bluff a decent amount of the time whenever you were the aggressor on the previous rounds we do bet this time using a pretty big size about the size of the pot and our opponent folds so good next here we have jack ten of spades we raise it up make blind calls flop comes 1097 the opponent checks we can bet we're check here either play is fine um i typically check but you can bet if you like opponent checks the turn we're just going to keep checking rivers the two opponent checks this is a spot where you have to ask yourself should i make a value bet or not and i think it's very very close if we had an ace here like ace three i would definitely go for a value bet you may say is there really a difference between ace three and king jack ten and there actually is a decent difference because our opponent could have a hand like king ten or queen ten that is always going to call a bet and we lose right also whenever i have jack 10 our opponent's a little bit more likely to have an ace when i have ace 3 our opponent's a little more likely to have a 10 and that's because if we have an ace in our hand it's a little bit less likely our opponent has an ace because there are fewer aces remaining in the deck because we have one in our hand as opposed to you know not having one in our hand when we have jack 10. so this is a spot where we should probably either bet tiny or check with our jack 10 and the sizing is very important here when you are value betting trying to get called by a worse hand on the river and you're betting with a junkyish hand like our jack 10 we need to go with a small size because if we go big our opponent's mostly going to call with only better hands and imagine in this scenario it goes check check and we just win very frequently but if we go if our opponent checks and we bet big and our opponent folds they're only folding hands that we would have beat anyway if it went check check so we don't win any money off those but whenever we bet big in our opponent calls now he does have those few aces in his hand that we lose to or he's going to have a king 10 that we lose to right so this is a scenario where if we're going to bet we want to bet tiny because we're trying to get called by a 9 or a seven so this is a spot where if you know your opponent will call the river decently often as you know some small stakes players will betting small is fine if you think your opponent will never call the worse hand then just let it go check check this time though our opponent does check we bet he folds and the fact that he folds means he probably just had nothing or maybe even made a snug fold with a hand like a nine or a seven in which case maybe our bet is not all that great take a look at one more hand we raised with jack 10 of spades hijack and button call flop comes jack 10-4 great spot to bet the flop big right turn is a two we continue betting big because we have one of our best made hands i also had a good draw like queen nine of diamonds nine eight of diamonds eight seven of diamonds nine seven of diamonds i would also keep betting big with those hands if i had three of a kind i'd also keep betting big and we get called and again thinking about the ranges at play we need to now fold if one of our opponents bets if one of our opponent bets notice if we bet the river we're mostly only going to get called by straights and flushes which we lose to which is really bad so if we do let this check through we have the best hand almost every time but if we face a bet we probably just need to get out of the way so we do check the opponent bets and we make the fold and you see how in all these scenarios we're asking ourselves how does our hand line up against our opponent's likely range and this is going to take a lot of practice you're going to find that if you go through a lot of hand examples and you pay attention when you're playing you will get better and better and better at narrowing your opponent's range if you are actively paying attention to that which you really should be because that is a large part of no limit hold up excellent job making it through this entire video you now have many of the tools required to crush post

[Document(page_content="let's discuss some post-flop tips that are going to go a long way to helping make sure you are not making the common errors that i saw my opponents making all over the place in the games that i played first things first do not overplay marginal made hands if you've gone through the cash game masterclass you know marginal made hands are usually hands like top pair no kicker down to something like ace high they're pretty good hands they could win at showdown if a little bit of money goes in the pot but if a lot of money goes into the pot they're probably beat and you're gonna find that for the most part if one or two post flop bets goes into the pot your strong but non premium hands like top pair bad kicker are usually good but if a lot of money goes into pot three or more bets their value goes down substantially so you're gonna find that whenever you are facing aggression with these hands you do not want to raise so many players in small stakes games especially live think that if they flop well they should put in rays so they don't get outdrawn and while it's true whenever you do put in a raise you will not get out drawn as often when you get action you're usually going to be in terrible shape in a big pot so you have to understand that sometimes you are going to get out drawn and that is okay when someone bets and you have a marginal made hand just call and go to the next betting round now whenever someone checks to you and you have a marginal maid hand that you have decided that you want to bet maybe the flop checked through and they checked you again on the turn or maybe they checked you on the flop and you're supposed to bet very frequently it is usually best to use a small or medium bet size both from a gto and an exploitative point of view because if you bet big a lot of the hands that you want to get called by will start folding for example if you have middle pair no kicker and you're going to bet it for value as you should we'll discuss thin value betting later but say we do decide to bet middle pair no kicker in a spot where it's clear the opponent's range contains a lot of weak hands you don't want to pot it because if you pot it again you're not going to get out drawn very often but you can't get caught by very many worse hands and if your opponents are anywhere near decent they are going to make sure that they are checking with some hands that you beat and you know even in the 5 cent 10 cent games that i played some of the players were actually pretty decent and if they're pretty decent they're going to play well enough and you have to make sure you're not trying to massively exploit someone who is who does not exist right and for the most part you're going to want to play reasonably good strong fundamentally sound post-flop strategies until you know more about your opponents which quite often you will not know a whole lot about your opponent's post-flop tendencies because you're not going to play with the same players all that often now as you play with the same players more and more and more especially in live poker maybe you can start making pretty big exploitative post-flop plays but for the most part you're not really going to know what your opponents are going to do so with marginal made hands you usually want to put in one or two post-flop bets and if you are facing aggression you usually want to call and not raise things have been going reasonably well gotta double up up here gotta double up down here up a little bit here down a little bit here you know splashing around uh we'll check behind we could bet like whatever i don't think it makes that much of a difference on the turn giving us like a stone blank i think we can probably bet for value slash protection i don't presume we're gonna get check raise very often on the turn although as you get check raise more often there you have to be way less inclined to bet all right check back there fold there again another spot where maybe i'm supposed to just be raising i'm not entirely sure here we have two pair but clearly not a great two pair we'll just let it check check check check check call riverbed if he bets we've hopefully induced plenty of bluffs collect a little pot that's good notice if we've got the flopping at check raise it becomes pretty nasty right i think though in general people are going to overfold two river shoves just across the board if that's the case especially when you think the range is mostly marginal made hands you want to be using big bats obviously you want to consider your opponent's strategy and what their range looks like of course if you're bluffing into a lot of nut hands then clearly that's not so good but like right there on this the civil war i was again i there are two kings on the board my opponent's pretty unlikely to have a king right so if they're pretty unlikely to have a king then and i have all the kings that's the spot where i think going for the big bet is pretty nice this guy could easily have a six he snap checks turn um i'll i'll check it back this might be a spot where exploitatively i'm supposed to just go for value on the turn and the river i'm sure from gto point of view i'm supposed to check it back a lot but we're not living in gto world right here this is obviously just a call this is probably too thin on the river to bed i think maybe it's not too thin i don't know because if he thinks i'm checking back a whole lot of asex some people get annoyed when people um it's called hit and run some people get annoyed whenever they get hit and run don't get annoyed when you get hit and run be happy about it uh we'll just check this one this is a board that's very good for the opponents so this guy raised like three betty called i think we just have to bet and get our money in yeah he's gonna have a lot of kings i think i'll just fold to this big flop bet immediately now if he doesn't hand like tens i'm not sure we'll be able to get him to fold so i think the players just let it go check check and then try to get to the river try to get to the showdown uh now do we try to bluff them off of a hand like eights or nines or tens and i don't think so i think we just let it go check check here we are gonna be days high sometimes we'll be like pocket sixes sometimes of diamonds all right all right good would you like to keep playing he will raise this one if this guy re-raises i'll just not fold i know it may sound a little bit optimistic with the king queen but this guy is clearly splashy yeah kind of saw this one coming but whatever he got a call fair flip looks like we're not gonna win when the guy's doing stuff like this with the ace four like obviously can't go around folding i'm playing 60 minutes we won 42 dollars all right good spots like this come up sometimes where someone's like clearly getting in there a lot right and used to be willing to gamble with them once you put in the raise when they jam if you think their range is much much much wider than normal you just can't fold sometimes they get you obviously you don't love it with the uh king queen but king queen suit is a pretty good hand um should we three bet the king eight king nine suited or just call i think it's i think you can mix it up all right this guy lamps i raise this guy freebasting we'll definitely call in position with the queen jack suited look at this raise call all in all right not a great flop for me should we ever float here against a small bet i don't know he checks though which is nice what would he possibly check here it's gonna be a lot of ace high i guess problem is he's probably not trying to fold it right so we'll just check check and try to improve he could just have aces right that's hand that makes a lot of sense it's kind of annoying that we turned the jack this does not feel like a good spot i mean if he checks river i'm just going to check behind there may be value in betting in the spot but i think it's fine to just not go for it all right and i mean who knows if the guy would have called me on the river there i i have no idea i have no idea what his strategy was if you have any backdoor equity or just like equity against middle pair which very often you will you should definitely be going for those little bets don't want to raise this ace to offsuit let's try it i'm going to use a big raise this is kind of similar to that well another earlier spot where i squeezed with the king 9 offsuit if i get limp free rays obviously i can fold if i get limp called well you know it's not great but whatever raise we will three bat two callers we have top pair no kicker all right this is where you have to be a little bit careful because you're going to run into better aces a lot so i think we just want to check and see what develops rooting for the voltage to check through that would be fantastic we'll just keep checking very very nice hand just to check and then check call um so i bet flop this guy calls no problem turns king which is pretty bad i really don't want a king or queen to come in this hand uh this guy raised like three buddy calls i bet floppy calls i think we can get value on the river and here we've done our the best best job we possibly can to induce bluffs so i think this is fine and this is a value bet on the river trying to get called by worst jacks and under pairs if he raises me i will fold reluctantly brutal say i'm going to fold am i going to fold this is brutal over here too because this guy's gonna bet the term with a lot of queens [Music] all right so we'll fold this one um this is a tough spot all right all right snap jams me on the river i mean i feel like this is supposed to just be an automatic fold but i'm really tempted to call for some reason you know what i'm going to call i don't love it we're going to be showing a lot of draws i think i mean obviously i have queen a lot i don't know i'm going to call all right good there are a lot of us that draws there there's a lot of us to draw us you've got to be a little call happy and and very importantly whenever your range is underrepresented that's that's an important point like right there whenever i check flop and then check call turn my range looks much weaker than it actually is but you've seen some of the other parts of this video where it's like actually pretty hectic so you want to make sure that you do not overload yourself such that you can't handle the hectic times they will inevitably occur so make sure you're not playing too many tables but at the same time you want to play as many tables as you reasonably can hmm top pair no kicker out of position with a ten of hearts i think checking or betting's both fine probably do want to check some kings it's probably one of my worst kings well this guy three best me again so we just four bet this guy and he folded i don't think we want to format this hand i think i'd rather do it again with like the ace 10. so we'll call and see the flop this is flop where if he has me we are going to lose all of our money if he checks do i bet i think i check it back if he checks because i really want to keep him in whatever garbage he has i i have no clue if this guy's range is overly wide or overly tight it's very very muddled in my head i really don't know what i'm looking at um king's terrible because he may bet like king queen on the flop small like he did king's really bad please check sir please check he keeps betting it's actually really rough i mean i got a call right that's lucky um [Music] let's keep checking here maybe i'm supposed to go for valium check call check check turn check river i'm going to bet tiny here trying to get him to do something dumb he just had nothing though stone air ball maybe he had the queen 10 exactly and we got lucky but as you see guys range is definitely wide right this guy's taking forever up here um you may ask why check top pair you should always check some top pairs in multi-way pots i think and once we check call flop check check turn is fine then on the river i definitely think our hand's gonna have to go for value but there's also american give your opponent every chance to bluff and again you want to likely be checking top pairs in most scenarios sometimes usually the worst top pairs are pretty good ones to check and that's one of the worst ones i mean i suppose i do maybe have some slightly weaker king x who are under the gun this guy just rip it in on me all right all right we're getting distracted okay clearly i should have played this clearly clearly all right this guy raises i would call a flop bet with the backdoor draws but once he checks we'll check check is turning meridian bluffing probably not i mean we will get ace high to fold sometimes but we'll just check now on the river i think we can definitely go for value i think this is good enough to go big you can easily call the 10 or like pocket nines or an eight i really don't expect to get check raise very often we do get called good then somehow checked it down it may sound bad that i'm laughing but it's like it's kind of funny right i mean they should be going for value in these spots and they're just not putting money in the pot the opponents seem to just not want value i don't understand why if we had a gut shot or if we had a backboard flush draw here i'd probably bet but with no backboard flusher i think i'm happy enough just check folding here i raised got called by in position i think it's fine to check this hand with the nines i mean it's not not it's it's obviously vulnerable to being outdrawn but i think it's okay just like check fold it may seem a little bit weak but it's just so easy to be beating the spot if this guy calls the two dollar bet i'd probably call maybe i'm supposed to raise do i ever put in a raise here uh that'd be fun maybe i just do it no it's so easy to be beat that feels a little bit tight there's a chance i'm supposed to do something there it's easy to get distracted especially when you're trying to commentate that said commentating is good because it makes you think out what you're doing instead of just like autopiloting right a lot of people just mindlessly click buttons and if they instead talked out everything they're doing then they would not mess up nearly as often i'm gonna check back this flop if they checked me this is a spot where both players are gonna have a lot of nines and obviously the king i lose to the king so we'll just check it back we really just don't want to see a ace queen jack 10 on the turn if they check to me again i think we can probably go for a low value checking it back would be fine too like as your opponents are better you should be way more inclined to check the turn i think they did check very quickly which is always a little bit weird but i'm not going to read anything into that until we have a good reason to raise here we can three better call same guy who stacked me sometimes people will presume that you are on tilt if they stack you maybe they should maybe they shouldn't top pair no kicker is a good hand to check call with any lock the guy will bluff it off kind of rough whenever he starts off with a big bat but we're gonna be calling down with this one too check check turn check check river well check turn and if he checks back i will check the river and check call i want to do everything i can to induce bluffs here four on the river doesn't change much i'm just happy to get to a relatively cheap showdown with this hand i have no clue why the guy did not go for value there that was terrible", metadata={'source': 'A9bXmqwYc8g', 'title': 'Learn To WIN With Marginal Hands In Poker!', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 25688,

[Document(page_content="crushing live poker tournaments by using some of my hands that I recently played in a 25 000 buy-in tournament to illustrate some points I've not streamed in a little bit so if you all are here please let me know I want to make sure that things are functioning you never know when you come back from a trip I've been Upstate with my family for the last uh few weeks but I'm back and ready to do the work so let's get right to it let's go through some 25 000 buying hands that I played just the other day in Florida right off the bat we are playing only 100 big blinds deep it is worth noting that in a lot of the High Roller tournaments to take place around Main Events they usually are kind of turboy which is fine I don't care a lot of people think oh man a turbo tournament that's terrible because they want to sit there and play poker all day turns out a lot of people do not actually want to sit there and play poker all day they want to get in some high value spots win or lose and then go home and that is fine now it is worth noting that quite often your Edge in Turbo eat tournaments cannot be that high if your opponents are all reasonably competent just because there's not a whole lot of time to extract value so as long as you are cool with that then you're good to go all right in this hand cutoff raises this is a good we'll say GTO American poker player he raises it up we have King five suited in the big blind this is a spot where calling is definitely the GTO recommended play you can pull up the poker coaching app to see this is a very clear call before the Flop you may want to three but every once in a while like King six suited or something like that but it doesn't really matter all that much um in the scenario with this hand you probably want to call you're going to find that when you are playing somewhat deeper stacked most of your Bluffs call them Bluffs from out of position when uh you do decide to three bat are going to be with hands like marginal-ish suited connectors like eight six suited nine seven suited eight seven suited Etc whereas if we were shallower stacked a lot more of our Bluffs would come from like a sex offsuit and King X offsuit so this is a scenario where if I am trying to play anywhere near GTO it's just a very very easy call all right flop comes a62 I check this is what my opponent should met pretty frequently and small but they surprised me by betting big hmm what does that mean well perhaps my opponent has a decently strong value hand they want to get value with notice if I am three betting hands like a king Ace Queen Ace track then if I have an ace it's probably not a very good one so maybe the opponent's going for just a lot of value in the times that I have an ace or a draw or a pair right like six five suited or something they could also just be betting big to try to make me fold everything besides the pair I'm not sure the fact that this is probably not the GTO play with many hands right off the bats always unnerving because either trying to maximally exploit me in some way or they don't know the GTO strategy here I don't know I don't know cool spot um King High flush draw though usually likes to call you don't want to raise the spot because if you raise and get re-raised it's terrible if you raise and get called they could easily have an ace in them in rough shape this is an easy call we'll see what develops turn is a queen I check again going to checks when it goes check check on the turn and I'll start to thank the opponent either has a whole lot of hands like Queen maybe they just bet Sans like Queen Jack to try to um Bluff me off of all unpaired hands or maybe they have some sort of marginal-ish Ace I have to presume my hand like Ace of Jack or Ace him would probably keep betting the turn but who knows stuff to know what's happening here I I typically think the Honda dealer has just like nothing or they have a queen a lot of the time they could have an ace though you call a few bets on the turn most likely unless he blast it gigantically big you're not really trying to fold out King High flush draw why do we not lead on the Flop you never want to lead on the Flop on boards that are good for your opponent's range and bad for my range and a side boards are always good for the opponent's range the initial razors range all right check check where's the Queen of Diamonds we got there now we have a few options we could vet big to try to get into call with any Ace and any Queen seems reasonable we could bet small to try to get him to call with any Ace or raise with any Queen in which case I would then re-raise I would not just call if I bet the river here for let's say three thousand or five thousand and he makes it something like 20. I'm definitely jamming to try to get full value from a queen or I could check to try to get him to bet with any Ace bet with any Queen and bet with all of his garbage the nice thing about checking is that if he does have a lot of garbage which I think you quite possibly could we're going to get him to Bluff some portion of the time to try to get me off of a six or a two but at the same time he may even check back again like asex if he thinks I'm good and will protect my checking range some portion of the time so this is a spot where I think I either want to bet quite big like pot or I want to bet really small I'm sorry slow down so so if I want to check or bet small I don't like the big bet because if I bet biggie may actually start folding out some weak Aces and it makes it impossible for him to Bluff so I think of the options I would rather either bet small like 5 000 or I'd like to check I think either one's fine depending on what I think about my opponent the big bet is only good if you think your opponent's a bit of a calling station with any Ace maybe even any pair but most players realize this run out is actually really really bad for pocket sevens right someone's gonna call in the scenario so I think in this spot I'm either going to check our best small thing both players are reasonable I check component checks it's a bummer they probably had him like sevens you know the nice thing about a small bed as well is that if they do have a hand like sevens they may just decide do you recall a lot of you are saying you want to bet 13 000 or 9 000. I really do not like the medium sizes at all because the medium sizes make it very difficult for the opponent to Bluff with whatever Bluff they have and it also will result in the opponent folding out they're really marginal-ish made hands like pocket sevens or pocket Jacks whereas those are hands that I really really want to get called by also it's a situation where usually you're gonna find almost always on the river something like two-thirds pot is almost never right with a hand like the nuts or the effective nuts this is the effect of nuts here um so this is a situation where you either want to be betting very big or betting small or checking not betting medium and you don't want to bet medium with a whole lot of hands anyway in these spots usually you're going to be either betting very big with a decently strong polarized range betting tiny with a finish value range plus a few nuts and a few Bluffs or checking so check check we win the hand nothing fancy all right king queen Suited is there a chance he checks the turn with the set absolutely not I mean I think that would be pretty bad given I could easily have an ace all right we have a limper and the 25 000 buying tournament is definitely worth noting that in a lot of super high roller tournaments or high roller turns there are a few relatively recreational players and that is why the games are good so this is a situation where we can definitely expect this range to be far weaker than normal um this is probably a player who's raising their best hands and limping a lot of their junk maybe they limp with some nut hands but whatever king queen suit is definitely good enough hand to raise cut off three bets that's annoying I don't remember who this player is but we're certainly not folding the king queen suited very very easy call 10-4-2 hijack checks um I think we I'm sorry we check and then they bet 15K so they bet small this is a situation where you cannot fold against good players I know it may feel a little bit dicey checking and calling with the king queen High out of position but you can't go around folding this um you do want to consider finding some Bluffs because if we do have a hand like Jax in the scenario we probably want to just go ahead and check raise and get in maybe a hand like Ace 10. so what Bluff should we use well first off do we have a ton of value hands that want to check raise the answer is not really right we don't have a ton of combinations so we don't really need to have a ton of bluffing combinations so if we don't want to have a ton of bluffing combinations we probably want to be bluffing some high Equity draws but notice there aren't actually any of those and then some low Equity draws and I think a hand like Jack nine of diamonds or queen nine of diamonds makes a whole lot of sense to check Ray's tiny you may say could you really check raise to something like 32k and then fold to a shop and I think you could I think it's actually not not insane um that because whenever you do check raising like Jack nine of diamonds you're obviously going to fold if they shove you right and Jack nine of Dimes is probably not quite good enough to check and then call right so I think in the spot you want to have an over card with backdoor flush draw probably to check raise small and then fold some people saying Queen drag sooner I think Queen Jack scooter might be too good as well again you don't get to find all that many combinations right if you're only check raising finish value hands like Jackson Ace 10 which could be beat anyway plus um a few junky Bluffs you don't get to have all that many junky Bluffs and if you only are doing with six combinations is probably okay anyway this thing I think is probably too good to raise so we call turns into a heart's check folding out any bet Finance standard um also some people say they would raise small over the limp when somebody limps for 1500 you don't want to raise like 5 000 because then you're giving them amazing odds to call their entire range and if they're calling their entire range they're not really making an error right because they're getting really good odds I mean unless they're just limping absolute trash I mean they could be limping absolute trash but no reason to think they're limping absolute trash so you probably you don't want to go tiny in that spot because your opponent's not making a mistake you make money when your opponents mess up not when they play well all right Ace five off suit facing the Rays from under the gun um this is the hand that you should call but if you had much of a weaker race like Ace three or Ace two it's probably a fold we could probably three but Bluff this 40 big blinds deep some portion of the time again reference to Poker coach and charts you will see ace5 offsuit I think I think three bet Bluffs a little bit in the spot so calling is fine oh I remember this player this player is loose aggressive European guy definitely worth noting um when your opponent's loose and aggressive then you should be way less inclined to overfold if the under the gun player is like really tight aggressive though he definitely should just fold the ace5 in this spot even closing the action even in the big blind even getting good odds doesn't matter you're gonna be so dominated but not against this player all right bottom pair we check component that's 5K if you bet smaller you may want to put in a raise but you don't want to be doing a ton of raising in general against the under the gun razor because they just have a whole lot of strong hands here um and also when the opponent uses a slightly bigger bet size than a small bet size you should be also less inclined to check grade so I think we're going to start losing some of these bottom pair check raises in the spot we'll just call turns an ace of hearts funny enough I check here but I think leading's actually viable you may say why in the world is leading Bible you well if you've studied the book excelling at tough No Limit Hold'em games there's a chapter in it that discusses times to lead and one of the main times to lead or when the board brings a three flush and very importantly the ace and the King are on the board if you think about the under the gun raising range under the gun raising range contains a lot of asex suited a lot of King X suited and not a whole lot of other suit hands they have Queen Jack Queen 10 maybe Queen nine Jack 10 maybe Jack nine ten nine that's about it it's only six combinations of hand maybe they have seven six maybe they have six five they do not have a whole lot of flushes here right if you think about the big blind defending range I actually have a ton of flushes because I'm defending a lot of um they're suited hands a lot of you are saying don't you want to lead so it doesn't check through again this is you're thinking way too simplistically here you always want to be thinking what does my what are the various portions of my range want to do and you're betting because you have an equity Advantage typically that's that's why you want to be betting um and in the spot we have a big equity and we start to have an equity advantage of my range because we have a lot of flushes and the opponent doesn't which allows us to bet with some finish value hands because I certainly don't want it to check through here and also um maybe just probably have the best hand right so I think I think leading is reasonable now the times I would definitely not lead or when I think the opponents very inclined to over Bluff and this loose aggressive European player of anything like this is the kind of guy I really want to check to because this player is not going to check through they instead are going to uh just keep betting with all potential Bluffs like what what are what are logical Bluffs here well anyhow the queen Jack or ten of Hearts is pretty logical and they may open it up with the Jack 10 off suit under the gun for all I know I don't think they do well but they may what are other logical Bluffs well maybe stuff like bottom pair middle pair may decide to Bluff although maybe not I also think if the opponent is good and loose aggressive and they've studied GTO poker then they will also Bluff with small pairs with a heart if you study our tournament masterclass you know that comes up some portion of the time so I definitely want to check to this player well Ace King just call if you lead with a bluffing hand well I mean look if I'm betting the turn I'm jamming the river because I have the best hand the vast majority of the time you can't be worried about losing in the spot when we lead with Ace seven of diamonds I mean against this player like I said I'm just not leading all that often at all someone's doing work in my apartment right now and uh that's what the drilling is if you can hear that go figure perfect timing right and again I think a lot of you in the chat are very concerned with the idea that you could be beat here and yeah it could be beat here but you have to realize my range is in great shape and the opponent was not going to go around folding Ace queen or Ace track and if they do there they're probably just gonna be drastically over folding but anyway this is what we're going to check against this guy because this guy is gonna be inclined to over Bluff he bets turn do I want to raise probably not seems like a pretty bad spot to race if I raise now what I'm gonna what am I gonna get action from well flushes which I lose to sets which I lose to two pair which I lose to and maybe like Ace Queen of Hearts Ace I'm sorry Ace queen with the queen of hearts or Ace Jack with the Jack of Hearts that's about it so I definitely do not want to raise in the scenario definitely want to call and keep my opponent in with all their Bluffs and I mean there's some world where say they have Ace King the river brings another heart I don't lose right because I'll just check check so this is a great spot just to call and give them every chance to Bluff the river River's a pretty sweet card a check gonna rips it in 1.5 x pot how do you feel about this one I will say in most small and medium-sized games when people take this line of blast flop blast turn bet flop that turn and then over James River they almost always have a very good hand and the high stakes games though I can guarantee this guy's gonna show up with some Bluffs like just random Queen of Hearts random Jack of Hearts random ten of hearts pocket fours with a four of hearts um and there are plenty of bluffing hands in this scenario right I don't think the opponent is going to overvalue hey like Ace with the queen of hearts that seems optimistic but it's just a pretty pretty reasonable call s me the pocket threes with the three of hearts aggressive line I would not expect most small medium sex players to take this line I think a lot of small medium six players just bet flopping and give up Jake Fleming says are you ready to go home though that does not matter the fact like you got to get all these thoughts out of your mind if you're thinking at the table oh man I should fold because I don't want to leave you're gonna have a tough time winning at poker honestly because you have to think how do I fare against my opponent's range in this scenario and if this guy is over bluffing if anything you cannot go around over folding absolutely not absolutely not so this is a spot where you just have to find a call some of you saying in the chat this guy's Bluff is ridiculous I'm sure I'm sure uh from a GTO point of view this should get bluffed off some portion of the time these small pairs with a flush blocker a baby flush blocker turns out these are reasonable bluffing hands because you think about your range you don't have all that many very very logical blocks because it's not like you're opening Queen of Hearts nine of Spades under the gun right so this is a situation where the opponent has to look kind of hard for Bluffs and when when you're looking kind of Hardcore Bluffs this is the type of hand that usually does go for the bluff those a lag player would you call this was a loose aggressive player I already said this was a loose aggressive player they could have a flush well any of course you could have a flush pot odds right pocket kings we open it up under the gun three players call me Queen eight three I think this is about where we want to bet with our best value hands that are vulnerable to being outdrawn and some draws draws here are going to be stuff like 10 9 Suited maybe hands like ace four of Clubs I know I want to be betting stuff like kings ace queen king queen probably something like that seems reasonable so I think we can bet usually when you go to bed in multi-way spots you typically want to go for a small size so we do go 5K some players are saying or some of you in the chat saying you want to bet big um look if you study GTO strategies and multi-way spots when you're betting out of position you pretty much always want to be betting small when you bet in general multiplayer pots you want to be betting small exploitatively I actually don't hate the idea of betting bigger because if you think your opponents are just literally never folding a pair and literally never folding a draw or a back door draw then sure right but good players realize hands like an eight or three are not great in the scenario and if I am raising under the gun and betting into all the opponents I I gotta have something good unless I'm just trying to get my money away so anyone who's good is gonna realize they should be drastically overfolding in the scenario and when you bet bigger and bigger they're gonna make bigger and bigger folds now but again if your opponent starts calling stations because they think H7 is the nuts here then maybe it does make sense to bet bigger cut off calls turns a jack of Clubs I'll enjoy the show by the way click the like button click the Subscribe button turn is Jack of clubs pretty bad card right the bad cards on the turn were an ace a queen a jack ten a nine or an eight those are all especially bad every other card is fine um I think we have a pretty easy check now we have relatively few 10 9 suited in our range the opponent certainly could have them in their range but also we don't have a whole lot of Queen jacks right this is a spot where I'm probably not opening Queen Jack under the gun although I may I don't know if I have Queen Jack in my range we can probably justify betting here if I don't have clean Jack in my range we definitely want to check and I say it all Queen track because I may not even open a pre-flop but also I would probably not bet Queen Jack on the Flop and that may surprise some people but you have to realize that in the scenario if you bet Queen Jack on the Flop and the turn and the river and gets called you probably lose unless you make two pair you want a marginal Ace to call pre-flop what are you talking about I'm not sure what you were talking about I did not even talk about marginal asex pre-flop all right so we're gonna check the turn here if the opponent bets we will definitely just call check check though rivers and two of spades take a second think about it what should we do in this scenario well what does the opponent likely have the opponent likely has in my mind a queen or a Jack you may say wouldn't they always bet the turn with a queen and I think not if the opponent's good if the opponent has a hand like Queen 10 or Queen nine Suited then they are very likely to check it back on the turn because they really don't want to bet and then get raised right the opponent also would float the Flop with Jack 10 and Jack 9 and they would almost certainly check those on the turn they can also have a hand like an eight and Eight's probably gonna fold to any reasonable bet I have to presume so I think we have two options depending on the opponent strategy either we could check and then when the opponent bets put in a check raise all in I know that may sound insane may sound a little bit loose and aggressive but in the spot I almost always have the best hand when the river brings a two because the two is just a stone brick right and notice if the opponent did have 10 9 or queen Jack or Jack eight they would almost always bet the turn they had a set they'd almost always bet the turn so you can very very much remove better hands from my opponent's range than pocket kings and the nice thing about this was if the opponent does have a queen or maybe even a jack they're going to go for value so I definitely love the idea of putting in a check raise here especially if it was loose and aggressive and no value bet then and maybe they'll even hear or call it off a little bit thin something a lot of people do not do nearly often enough is put in a check raise on the river the other option is to bet big if you that big in the spot the opponent is definitely going to call the Queen and they'll probably call the Jack given there are plenty of busted draws I could have like a sec suited right it's four suited like I mentioned I'd probably bet on the flop and probably give up on the turn and be sitting here with random Base Four of hearts and feel inclined to Bluff it so this is a pretty good spot to either check or bet big some people saying they want to half pot it I hate the idea of half potting like what are you trying to get caught by when you have pot like eight seven I mean eight seven may call but probably not pocket sevens may decide to call but probably not so I think if you're trying to get called by random hands like eight seven you probably want to go smaller but even then kings are not a hand that wants to go small on the spot because kings are almost always going to be the nuts here right because of what I just said and whenever the opponent does not bet the turn and then the river brings a total brick too we basically have the nuts and the nuts usually wants to go big we talked about this with the King five suited earlier same spot here nuts usually want to go big or check we do a big phone calls we win and they show me a queen that's a bummer it's a bummer because if I checked they would have bet then we could have gotten in the check raise I'm as you think your opponent has fewer and fewer Queens in the range you should be more inclined to bet River but in the spots there's no reason I think they have like squarely a queen I also usually like betting big in High Roller tournaments in general because the players are a little bit more call Happy on the river especially when random draws Miss and there are plenty of draws that or just junk cans I could have that could feel inclined to Bluff so I'm fine with that one pocket aces under the gun raises under the gun is a loose aggressive splashy player who I've already seen raise and then call a three bet with the queen Force Suited foreign 53 big blinds deep I think we have two options the obvious option is to re-raise GTO strategy is to erase if the opponent is going to call three best with the queen Force we should definitely re-raise so that's a good reason to re-raise but you see the reason to call there's a very clear reason to call here too well take a look at the two players you have to act on the button and the small blinds the button in the small blind both have almost no chips very very very very good shoving Stacks right and if they think under the gun is Raising with stuff like Queen 4 suited and I think I'm going to obviously widen my calling range to try to play pots with this loose aggressive splashy player this is a great spot to Flat call to try to induce slightly wide shoves from the small blind or the big blind so I I love calling in the spot although look I totally get the three betting is fine as well if you can somehow look and tell the player in the button and the small blind are interested in the hand definitely call if you can still look and tell they're done with a hand definitely three bad we call it does not work pop comes eight five four opponent bets eleven thousand [Music] I usually say to not get fancy with Aces just raise it I mean I usually say follow the GTO charts but It's always important to realize GTO charts not necessarily apply unless you have a very very very very specific GTO chart right and um in this scenario I don't have charge for 15 and 20 bit blind sacks remaining behind but I bet calling Aces isn't all that bad maybe men re-raised to get the small blind to shove no you got to realize if under the gun raises and you re-raise small pre-flop small blind and button are never shoving ever unless they have a good hand because it's so obvious you're calling their shove if you put in five big ones you're not folding for 10 more which will make it to where they must have a good hand to show whereas when you call they can shove substantially wider all right you all are all over the place on this flop scenario of eight five four I think it's a pretty reasonable spot to raise given the opponent's range is very wide and they're gonna have a lot of random pairs like Queen four suited or like a random seven or a random six um also if the opponent does have an over pair it's really nice to raise now before the board potentially gets worse now I realize they're super loose pre-flop but obviously they could solve a hand like pocket tens right the problem with calling is that the turn's going to be rough some portion of the time to the point that either my hand gets way worse although I already know I'm not folding or to where the opponent's made hands get a lot worse like say the guy does have Queen Force suit he may just like not fold it to a flop raise but say the turns the Jack and then he bets and then I raise then he's going to full Queen Force suited every time so I think we want to raise and I don't think we want to go too big Josh says go 40K the problem with 40K is it doesn't get the opponent any room to Bluff shove me really can you apply all this to online well yeah of course I mean online and live hooker are the exact same thing the only difference is the ranges online are usually better than the ranges live because online players typically play better than Live players right also usually have fewer reads online compared to live so anyway right here I think we just want to raise it's definitely annoying when you raise the opponent folds but this type of loose aggressive splashy battling player is the type of player who will not fold all that often definitely do not Jam all in by the way some people saying rip it all in I hate ripping it all in because then your opponent can never Bluff you want to keep the opponent in the pot with Bluffs it's vitally important everybody here worried about getting full value and protecting your range or thinking about the wrong things the main value the main point here is you got to keep your opponent in with all their garbage that is what we are trying to accomplish you know we go for 27k things is fine and reasonable again you don't want to go too big because if you go too big your opponent cannot float with all sorts of garbage and they cannot re-raise with all sorts of garbage then the opponent makes it 63 with 90 behind how do you feel about this this is a weird one at this point I do not expect to get re-raised very often at all because I mean but when I raise I'm either saying I have some total garbage or I have a super nut hand right or I have some high Equity draw I'm probably not raising the high Equity draws because I don't want to get re-raised right uh so I think it's a spot where shoving's the The Logical play just because if he folds out any hand with Equity I don't care and if he does have a hand like A7 I don't care if he folds right that's that if I know he has A7 I want to keep men the thing is it's like this might be the type of player who just takes a hand like Jack ten of Hearts decides to blast it um yeah I don't know I don't know definitely a rough spot I mean it's a rough spot in that I don't know if I'm supposed to presume the opponent's range it's so garbage that I'm supposed to call or if I'm supposed to just presume the guy has an over pair top pair or a draw or something and he wants to get it in and again people saying that this board does not connect with his range you must have missed it five seconds ago where I said the guy raises Queen four suited and calls three best with it and whatnot so this is the type of player who could definitely have random one pair of hand here anyway I don't know if it's a call or a shove I could be convinced either way I kind of presume that once the opponent puts in 63k with only 90 behind he just has a hand he's putting in so I shove he's snap folded that's a bummer that's a big bummer it's a big bummer because he probably just had no equity and he has no equity I obviously want to keep him in the pot so that's a bummer all right ace and King 14 big blind all in from the LoJack seat we're on the button what do we do with our Ace King offsuit take a second think about it again only people in the chat saying that he has a good draw he has a top pair he has a set you don't know what do you mean how could you possibly predict a random player on the internet in a hand history play based on my second hand speaking how do you know to the point that you're willing to type into the chat box that this player has a drawer this player has a center this player has whatever you don't know people have ranges people have ranges not specific hands they have ranges all right basically 42k raise we only have one option in my opinion if you've read my books at all if you study pokercoaching.com at all you know the answer it is to call whenever someone shoves all in if you have off the shove is six big blinds or fewer you usually want to re-raise the minimum if it's 6B blinds or more you usually want to call a lot of people are thinking oh I want to shove because I want the players yet to act to fold but what do you want to fold Ace Jack like you want him in with Ace Jack right this is the spot where I don't know exactly what you're calling range should be but should probably be something like sevens and better and like Ace 10 suited and better a strike off suit and better maybe king queen Suited I think that's a pretty reasonable calling range and then if you get shoved on by someone you have to act for 240k then we'll call it off with Jackson better and Ace King maybe he's Queen Suited and that's a very nice strategy what a lot of people do wrong is that they shove the hands that they want their opponent when they want their opponents to fold and they call with the hands that are just the super duper nuts but if you start doing that and anybody is halfway aware of what you're doing you're just gonna get crushed because they're not going to put in their money when you just call and detrimentally they're going to call it off a little bit wider when you do shove which is really really bad for you just the spot where this is 14 big blinds this is just a very very very easy call we call he has pocket eights we lose nothing to see there Ace King again I raise it up get called by the hijack hijack is a loose well you know hijack is not necessarily loose hijack is a young European player who I think plays well I I don't know a ton about the player but he gets in there he battles he he plays pots all right flop comes five three two what should we do with Ace King on the five three two why not men re-raise because if I'm in re-raised with a hand like sevens and they get jammed on I lose more money again we're playing our range not our hand we're playing all hands we could have in this scenario now you could split the range if you wanted but I don't think there's a reason to split it um okay Ace King on five through two this is the board I'm gonna check a ton I from out of position against the hijacked you want to be checking a lot in the scenario if you studied the tournament masterclass at pokercoaching.com you know that you do a ton of checking here should we check going to bets 10K I think it's a spot where the opponent's supposed to have a lot of small bats and when they met half pot you have to ask can I get any information from this I think generally people bet this size in the scenario is probably closer to to being a lot of pairs that are just trying to get value slash protection although you know loose aggressive battling opponent not insane not like an insane player but you know pretty active player they could easily just be betting stuff like Queen Jack and whatnot um so I think this is a spot where we should probably I mean look we're not folding here um the questions either we want to call or we want to raise and I don't think we need to raise this one either because the opponent may just be betting lots of stuff planning to check it down so we're gonna call doesn't checking polarize you no I'm going to be checking the vast majority of my range here and people saying shove it all in definitely don't shove it all in you get called here I mean terrible shape turn to three check opponent bats 25k rough spot for sure I ran this through a GTO solver you know what it say you should do here at the Ace King specifically diamonds and hearts it said you should call half the time and fold half the time now if I think you bonus a little bit loose and aggressive I'm gonna be way more inclined to call if I think the opponent is um on the more cautious side I'm definitely gonna fold if I am playing a tournament if anything I should be way more inclined to fold because I don't want to put myself in a spot to play a pretty big pot going to the river with a marginal Bluff catcher ideally you want to avoid very roughly Breakeven scenarios so this is a spot where I think you can definitely go either way knowing me I lean towards calling here holding when I'm getting okay pot odds with a pretty good hand because you got to realize there's no guaranteed he posts just gonna blast it off on every river and also there are plenty of good Rivers for me right ace King four are all great so we stick around well I love other people in the chat some people are in the chat are saying like easy folder easy call you got to realize if you think this is an easy fold against a good player you're screwing up if you think this is an easy call against a good player you're screwing up by saying it's an easy call or an easy fault in my mind I think you mean I call here 100 or I fold here 100 which would be very very wrong I mean look at the GTO solver run it I think if anything the player is over bluffing which should lead me to call more right but this is a situation where literally it's like 50 call 50 fold which means doesn't really matter what you do rivers of three I check opponent goes kind of big 60k definitely annoying spot as well uh the only way you can justify calling here is if you are very sure the opponent will over Bluff right now it's pretty easy to over Bluff here if you think about it I don't block the ace acts of Hearts I don't want Queen extra Hearts jackets cards 10x a heart so you don't certainly have all those I also don't block just random uh random draws random nonsense stuff like Queen Jack right they would they would definitely like Queen Jack of Spades probably gonna bet the Flop probably gonna bet the turn may or may not bet the river it depends by the way it's important to note that this is a spot where we need to be very sure we have our range protected otherwise like say this is one of the best teams in our range like apparently some of you think you would do where you'd bet your over pairs but check your ace high well then you definitely have to call right because this is one of the best hands we can have but I know I'm checking a lot of repairs here so I know my range can be decently protected and when your range is easily protected you start folding out a lot of these asexes right Ace to a Hearts would be painful haha why do we keep calling when we're most likely beat why do you think we're most likely be whenever you say you think the opponent is or most likely to be you're saying the opponent has literally no Bluffs in their range if they have no Bluffs on the Range then fold come on like poker is easy if you know what your opponents are doing but remember we're playing a high six tournament against good players you give this guy Queen Jack of Spades I think he's going to be bluffing some portion of the time especially if he thinks I have a whole lot of Base X which means let's be more inclined to call now in the scenario uh if you run this to a GTO solver Ace King is mostly a fold which means if you think your Pawn's playing perfectly then uh spot where we have a probably a fold why would this be one of the best hands we have well a lot of you sat on the flop in the chat that you would bet your over Pairs and check your ace high if you're going to bet your over Pairs and check your ace high this is essentially the best hand we can possibly have right so if this is the best hand we can possibly have we cannot fold it now obviously that's not this scenario then we are in here because I would be betting with I'd be checking with a lot of over pairs as well because like I said I check a lot on the Flop here but that's why it's important to protect your range otherwise if this is the best hand you can have you're super easy to play against so anyway what do I do here I think I called you know me I call a lot pocket times we lose there's obviously a value bet on the turn wow sneakies thinks that the opponent is awful at poker why do you all think that people in 25 000 terms who fly halfway across the world are so bad at poker I don't understand it makes no sense you gotta understand whenever you say things like my opponent's never bluffing here or you say things like that's obviously a bluff when you say things like this you're saying my opponent is so terrible that they are incompetent enough to the point that they have no Bluffs and or no value best in a particular spot and you know maybe that's true against some of your opponents if you are congrats because you're gonna win all their money you're gonna win all their money in poker is easy but I hate to break it to you in high six games poker is not easy all right ace King very next hand I actually got these these three Ace Kings three hands in a row Ace King Ace King Ace King three answer lost the first one lost the second one waiting so happened on the third one I raise it up uh button calls button good lucish aggressivist kid comes Ace King five two options is able to bet three streets with ace high that you beat the opponent's probably going to be bluffing Ace hiding me bluffing King High Queen hijack I 10 high um so it's Ace King again this was literally the next hand maybe maybe two hands apart really really back to back so the opponent just said all right I mean we the opponent just saw me call down with a hand worse than ten so obviously some sort of bluff catcher right they probably presume pair but maybe block catcher so they saw me track out of position with a bluff catcher and check call does that matter doesn't matter what just happened in the very recent past I think no some people think it does some people do not there are some players who are way more levely and trying to figure out what you're doing than others a lot of people just try to play close to GTO I'm not sure what this particular player thinks but in most high stakes games I do not care at all about what just happened recently but again some players I certainly will um so in this spot we have two options either chat call uh BET BET The Flop and Veteran jump shop River or just put in check raise immediately I think either play is definitely fine and definitely viable I decided to check opponent about 8K and I called I did not like this call in order to call here I have to think the opponent's range is either pretty garbage or I have to think they are going to attempt to drastically over Bluff and or value bet thinly or I have to think that the opponent's gonna overfold to a check race I know who this player is and I think they probably actually would overfold do a check raise which means I probably shouldn't have checked to begin with I probably should have just bet flop if I do that flop by the way I probably want to go medium size so I can easily get it in by the river you don't want to go too small I don't think so you know I don't mind the spot I think check call is fine if you think opponent's going to overfold I'm not all that worried about getting outdrawn um obviously flush draws exist but at the same time so do all sorts of other hands that that are drawn very very thin so I don't know we can go either way but I I should have just bet the Flop here I think bet flop is very standard if I did check raise it'd probably be something like 23k crypto dad life 21 23 whatever you have to realize in this spot the opponent's range connectivity is very good right so as the opponent is more likely to have just a decently good hand that's not going to fold you'd rather just put in more money when the opponent's range is either going to be like really good hands or absolute trash in those scenarios you probably just want want to go for the smaller check raise but here it's really easy for the opponent to have a pair or a draw right if they have a pair to draw a lot of the time in the spot you probably want to go slightly bigger also from out of position you usually want to go slightly bigger not always but sometimes all right turn to Queen of Diamonds pretty bad card of course I check bonobet's 32 with 43 behind only annoying spot um obviously I'm not folding though this is a hand that is way too good only question should I call her Jam and if you think about the player's logical Bluffs what would they even be they would be hands like ten of Hearts ten of diamonds or ten of diamonds ten of X right that's a logical Bluff maybe he has like nines eight sevens those names are all drawing pretty thin but at the same time they may not feel inclined to Bluff the river so definitely a rough scenario because I don't think a lot of their logical Bluffs are going to keep bluffing on the river so if they're not going to keep bluffing the river with lots of logical Bluffs we probably just want to get it in now to protect the equity also notice that in this scenario if we do shove the opponent's gonna be getting really good pot odds they're gonna have to put in 30 to win what 200 or no what uh how much is it yeah 30 to win 200. so like they're gonna call it off with all their stuff right so I think we just want to call it we just want to rip it in I think that's the only play that makes any sense we shove they call eight seven of diamonds and we have been vanquished that's why GTO is no good you just have to be able to look them in the eye and tell if they have a good hand you know if only poker was as easy as just looking at someone and winning all of their money unfortunately it is not that easy unfortunately it's not that easy it's tens and nines betting to flop that often some players will some players won't I don't I don't hate it I think it's probably okay but um yeah we lost sometimes you win sometimes you lose and that's how it goes someone who's not losing recently is our newest poker coaching coach Brock Wilson you've been paying attention to the poker news literally yesterday he took third place in a very big tournament for four hundred eleven thousand dollars huge congrats to him and right now we are having a Labor Day sale at pokercoaching.com and we have brand new training exclusively from Brock Wilson who's out there crushing the games current videos up at this point include an introduction to pile solver reviews and discussing very very common spots for in position versus big blind how you should be playing those scenarios and thinking about those spots I know a lot of spots we went through today were apparently somewhat unknown to some of you all and he goes through a lot of those spots he also goes through button versus cutoff strategy a lot of players make blunders all over the place playing cut off versus button when you raise the cutoff in the button calls because they usually continuation bet too often they don't check raise enough Etc et cetera he also discusses defense frequencies and why they are important I'll give you the spoiler if you fold too much you can't win it poker if you consistently give your Equity away to your opponents they're gonna win and you're gonna lose and also how to adjust your strategy and how to analyze your strategy using GTO solvers when you have some idea of how your opponents play if you know that's your opponent let's say does not dream about often enough or if you know that they let's say don't continuation bet the Flop often enough or maybe the continuation bet the Flop every time you can use the GTO solver to give you the strategy against the mistakes that your opponents are making and in a lot of small six games you very often know mistakes your opponents are making for example a lot of you in the chat seem to think that your opponents do not Bluff the river nearly often enough fine put it in a solver let the solver know that my opponents do not Bluff the river often enough and you're going to see that you should drastically overfold on that street wherever that is if your opponent's drastically over Bluff you're not gonna fall very often at all kind of like that Ace King hand I probably leveled myself into thinking the opponent may be over bluffing maybe not I don't know maybe it was good maybe it was a good call maybe it was terrible that's the tough thing about poker but um anyway Brock is the

[Document(page_content="how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year playing poker so let's begin first by looking at the big picture how can you make a hundred thousand dollars a year playing online poker and to do that we want to look at a simple formula which is the expected value of winnings which is the multiplication of dollars per hand times hand played this is the simplest way to look at your expectation playing poker how much money are you making per hand multiplied by how many hands you play which gives you your total earn now of course this is just a simplified version of the big picture because in reality it may be difficult to pinpoint exactly how many dollars you will earn per hand because of things like variance but you can still get a general idea by focusing on your win rate and taking a sample size that's going to give you a clearer picture of what it looks like and the more you play the more clear that picture and that expected dollar per hand is going to be now when it comes to variance we know thanks to what jonathan little said that volume cures variance and that the more hands that you play the more likely you are to get lucky for all the times you get unlucky and to get unlucky for all the times you get lucky as well so the more hands that you play the more the variance is going to be muted per se and the more your win rate will be closer to your true expected win rate so the cool thing is that by playing more hands you are naturally muting the effect of variance and getting closer to the results that you deserve and getting closer to your true win rate so by playing a large number of hands or sample size you're already moving towards that true win rate and now we just focus on the other side of the equation which is how we can increase that dollars per hand and the way to do that is increasing your win rate that's the key to boosting that number so that the amount that you deserve will be larger than it was previously now let's go ahead and break down both variables in the equation so that you can learn how to maximize your expected value and get closer to that 100 000 a year playing online poker cash games okay let's start with dollars per hand also known as win rate or in the case of poker tracker or hold a manager if you're using those tracker softwares uh bb or big blind per 100 now we're going to look at the factors that affect dollars per hand so that you can recognize where you can put your attention so as to be able to increase your dollar per hand and to increase your expected value of total winnings so factors affecting dollars per hand the first one is your skill level and this can be improved by studying and using the content in the poker coaching premium members area or if you don't have a membership at poker coaching premium yet you can improve your win rate by watching more of the free training content that's available right here on youtube next up we have the level of competition and this can be improved by game selection if you're playing in games that are softer if you're playing games with weaker players lesser competition you're going to naturally as a result of that have a higher expected dollar per hand ways you can look at this when you're scrolling through a lobby you can look for tables with a high players per flop percentage because it usually means players are playing too loose you can look for tables with a high average pot which it doesn't always check out but sometimes if the average pots really big it may be because someone's tilting and you know going all in every hand and the best way to identify good games is if you have your opponents pre-labeled because you've played lots of sessions with them and you look for your mark of the um whale at the table and try to get in those games whenever those players are on third thing that's going to affect your dollars per hand is your state of mind and body and the way to improve this is the self-care the off the table the mental game side of poker by putting some time and energy and attention and effort into fitness into diet maybe into meditation into socializing into having fun you're going to ensure that you always feel your best have a minimal amount of stress and can therefore play your best when you sit down at the tables and finally one of the things that we have that affects your dollars per hand is the actual stakes that you're playing obviously higher stakes with the same win rate in terms of big blind per 100 is going to be more dollars per hand the same win rate at a lower limit would lead to lower dollars per hand so just as an example if we're winning at eight big blinds per 100 at 50 nl that would be four dollars per hundred hands or four cents per hand for winning at six big blinds at a hundred no limit which is a lower win rate but a higher stake we're making six dollars per hundred hands or six cents per hand and if we're winning at four big blinds per hundred which is half the win rate we had at 50 nl but we're playing at 200 nl now we're making eight dollars every 100 hands or eight cents per hand now it's easy to think okay well i want to make the most money so i just got to go move my way to the highest stakes and it's not that simple because there are a few factors at play one the level of competition is probably going to be higher at the higher stakes you need to be ready for that competition two your comfort level with the amount of money that you're playing for is very important because if you feel like you're playing outside your comfort zone you're not going to be able to play your best poker finally your bankroll must be big enough to handle the swings at the higher limits that you're playing and that's why bankroll management is so essential because of that variance that comes into play in the short run that is muted in the long run can negatively affect your bankroll if you don't have adequate buy-ins behind to play at the limit that you're playing so a good test is that if you're feeling bored with the limits that you're playing you're probably playing too low and if you're feeling overly excited or anxious or stressed then you're probably playing too high and that's a good natural way to check in if you're playing at appropriate limits remember this is a long run game this is a long run plan we don't need to move to the higher stakes as quickly as possible even the mid stakes as quickly as possible we want to be focused on focusing on improving our confidence so that we can confidently move to the next level and believe that when we do we'll be able to stay there so may a little note that steak should be the last thing that's considered because when you focus on improving your skill level you focus on finding games where the level of competition is weaker and you focus on keeping your state of mind and body in a peak state all those will naturally lead to you being able to move up stakes more effectively and more sustainably cool so that was the dollars per hand side of the equation next let's move on to the other variable in the equation which is hands plate now this is where most people make the mistake of thinking it's impossible to get the kind of earnings that they want from playing poker yes it's hard to make a hundred thousand dollars in a day playing poker or in a week or in a month for that matter but if you're putting in consistent hours following a schedule and getting lots of hands in you'll find that the large dollar numbers aren't so unattainable because when you are focusing on increasing the number of hands played you're increasing the variable on the right side of the equation which when multiplied by a modest win rate or dollars per hand is going to lead to a large number of total winnings we can increase any of the variables on the right side to increase that variable on the left side which is total winnings so let's look at the factors which affect the number of hands played so that you can start to strategize on how you can improve or increase the number of hands played per year if you're looking to hit that 100k per year playing poker first we have session lengths also known as time on tables so every hour played increases the total hands played geometrically so you know if you play for two hours instead of one hours you're gonna get twice as many hands but it is worth knowing what your personal sweet spot is going to be because there tends to be a drop off in focus after you hit that sweet spot and the quality of play typically goes down a little bit which is going to lead to a lower dollars per hand so there's a bit of a trade-off that happens there when we go for those marathon sessions of 4 6 8 10 12 hours next we have the number of tables played and every table added will increase your number of hands per hour geometrically right so if you play two tables instead of one you're going to get twice as many hands per hour as you would if you just played one table third we have the number of players per table which is an interesting one uh one that's often forgotten the more short handed you play the more hands per hour you're going to get a three-handed table is going to get many more hands per hour than a six-handed table would be and it's not just double it's actually three or four times as many hands so if you're able to play short-handed poker and you're finding games that are good that are four three two-handed um instead of five or six handed you're gonna get many more hands per hour in finally we have the number of sessions um and just as an example five sessions per week is five times the number of hands is one session per week two sessions per day is typically one and a half to two times the number of hands is one session per day because uh the second session is usually a little bit shorter than the first one due to the decrease in focus and mental energy that's there later in the day okay so now comes the fun part of stacking things together and getting the multipliers so we'll take again our formula here looking at hands plate and see the example of stacking effects so let's start by looking at if we play one table for one hour it's about 120 hands per session now if we decide to play four tables for one hour instead of one table per hour now we're getting 480 hands per session an increase of 4x what if instead of playing for one hour one table we play one table for four hours now once again we're getting 480 hands per session but here's where the real powerful stuff comes in where we get those stacking effects if we play four tables for four hours we are now getting 1920 hands per session instead of 120 and if you can maintain a similar win rate well four tabling for four hours as you could well one tabling for one hour you're making 16x as many dollars per day in expected value as you were when you were just one tabling for one hour and this is the power of volume now note when mapping this out it's easy to think you're a robot and say i'm just gonna play eight hours a day for 12 tables at a time seven days a week and then boom i'll be getting like a hundred thousand hands a week which is like five million hands a year but the reality is you're human not a robot i think and it's important in addition to playing poker which is gonna take energy and use focus that you engage in activities that will replenish your energy and renew focus so a couple signs to look for and watch out for if you're getting tired and losing focus you're probably pushing yourself too hard if you're timing out on hands or feeling restaurant decisions you're probably playing too many tables or playing too high of stakes if you're getting emotionally frustrated emotional and frustrated easily then you're probably cramming in too many sessions per day or week so for me the sweet spot for session length is two to three hours and if i'm going to play two sessions per day then the second session is usually going to be shorter than the first something like one to two hours for me the sweet spot for a number of tables depends how tough the games are if the games are very soft then i want to get as many tables as possible something like 9 to 12 however if the games are tough and i'm going to have to make a lot of decisions that's going to require a lot more thinking a lot more challenging spots then the sweet spot lands somewhere around four to six tables for me and i'll do my best to ensure that those four to six tables that i pick are the best ones available no although playing short-handed means more hands per hour it also means making more decisions so if i find a good heads up or three-handed game then i'm probably gonna play less tables than i were if all my tables were six-handed but because that short-handed game is going to be really good it's going to be worth it to play fewer tables as a result and for you it's probably going to be a process that you just kind of feel out so for me the sweet spot for sessions per week depends on what else i have going on in my life if i have no other work i can easily play seven days a week if playing just one session per day but i would still be wise to take at least one full day off to recover if i'm doing those double sessions so if on the other hand i have like work projects then i find it's best to play shorter sessions or just play on the days of the week when i have no other work and there's nothing wrong with being a weekend warrior if you have you know a career going at the same time as you're playing poker your poker is really supplementing your income rather than being your primary source okay so now that we've looked at the inputs and discussed how you can optimize each of them let's look at some basic math to work the outputs so you to have you making a hundred thousand dollars per year playing online cash games let's assume that you're playing 200 no limit and maybe you have to work to weigh your get up to this but you can get it that you can get there let's assume you have a win rate of five big blinds per hundred or ten dollars every hundred hands or ten cents per hand let's assume you can comfortably play eight tables for approximately one thousand hands per hour and let's assume that you play four hours a day five days a week for a total of 20 hours per week so expected value winnings per week 10 cents per hand times 1 000 hands per hour times 20 hours per week 20 000 times 10 cents 2 000 per week if you play 50 weeks of the year we now add 50 into the equation for our total hands for the year and that's taking two weeks off of playing leads to 100 000 per year and this doesn't include deposit reload bonuses rake back vip rewards free rolls and promotions or any other loyalty bonuses that you're going to get from the poker site and if you're putting in this kind of volume you know anywhere from 40 to 100 000 hands per month you're certainly going to be getting rewards from the poker sites that you're playing on cool so just a few common questions to address before we wrap things up uh first one is what if i'm not playing one two no limit your winnings may be lower but your win rate may also be higher so you know 10 big blind per 100 win rate at 100 nl is the same as a five big blind win rate at 200 nl conversely if you're playing bigger a two big blind win rate at 500 nl is the same as a five big blind win rate at 200 nl so the ability to play at higher limits is very powerful in terms of your ability to increase your dollars per hand but it's important to be a winning player in the games when you move up to them and that's where working on your game and watching the material on the poker coaching youtube channel and at pokercoaching.com is going to make a huge difference because you don't just want to play in the bigger games you want to have a positive expected value in the bigger games so that you're actually making more dollars per hand playing bigger to go with that extra variance you're taking on next question what if i can't play that many tables and this is fair this is a skill that is progressively developed most people are capable of playing at least four tables simultaneously and even that is 500 hands per hour when you're not playing zoom so it's something that you progressively can build up to once you get from one table to two tables then it doesn't become that hard to go from two to three to three to four and four to five it's just progressively moving up and not going from one to eight it's getting comfortable making your decisions making your preflop plays and getting used to your sizings and once everything becomes automatic you can play more tables it's kind of like when you learn to drive a car and at first all you can do is drive the car but eventually you can listen to music while you're driving have conversations while you're driving because a lot of things just become automatic and happen unconsciously third question is what if i can't play that many hours and the hundred thousand dollars a year playing online poker that we discussed in this video is geared to people who either want to play full-time or for high achievers who can juggle a serious hobby on top of their career nobody says you need to hit these numbers making an extra 10 000 to 20 000 a year from a side hobby sounds pretty cool to me and you know if you have a good career going there's no reason you need to make an extra 100k from playing poker you can make whatever amount makes you happy and the hours required for that are probably going to be much lower than the ones discussed in this video the main question to look at is what do you want from the game if you're already making more than a hundred thousand anyway from something else you probably don't need to make that 100k from poker and is 100k really necessary are you playing the game for profit in which case you're going to want to make a plan like this and stick to it and get in those hours get in those hands increase your dollar per hand and maximize your earnings if you're playing for pleasure maybe that's not such a concern and you just want to play when the games are the juiciest and the most fun and the most entertaining or maybe you're playing for passion where your goal is to be the best player you can be and you're focusing on quality of play but you aren't so worried about quantity ask yourself what you want from the game and simply honor that all right that's gonna wrap up this presentation uh this has been evan jarviscoach.com hope you enjoyed the video and that you learned a thing or two and maybe can make a game plan it's going to help you improve your dollars per hand and your total number of hands played that's going to lead to more winnings at the end of the year if you want to see more free poker training videos like this one make sure you click that

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is alexander fitzgerald or assassinato today i'm going to be discussing with you how to exploit microsix players if you've ever seen one of my videos you know that i believe the best way to learn is through doing through action through application through practice so i'm just gonna make you practice and then we're going to discuss how we could better play against micro sticks players i know many of you who are watching this video you like playing micro stakes games you're excited about poker you want to learn how to beat these tournaments with thousands and thousands of players it feels like it should be a little bit easier because a number of these players are recreational in nature and don't always play the exact form of poker that would lead to results so you know there must be a way to exploit them but you're not sure what that way is well today we're going to discuss a number of the ways you can exploit micro 6 players and get results and have a little bit more fun playing these uh these games so let's go ahead and just start so here you have queen nine offsuit villains who you actually just got moved to this table so you don't know much about either of these players so what would you like to do here full color raise and for most of these decisions i have a succession of pre-flop flop turn and river decisions that i'm going to test you on with the pre-flop decisions i'll give you about five seconds uh with the flop decisions i'll give you five seconds-ish turn maybe 10 river 15 and yeah so just be prepared for that if you'd like to get more out of this lesson i'd highly encourage you to take notes okay so you you've looked at this spot now for a few seconds so this is one of the first ones i want to discuss with you guys so most micro stakes players i talk to and i i've done thousands of personal lessons over 10 years if you don't know me if you don't know me i i've done a lot of private coaching that that's been my main thing i do have w coupons scoop wins wpt final tables ept final tables i won the 250k on acr last year but my primary focus has been uh coaching that that's definitely been what i do and i with a focus on database analysis and one of the things i do notice with microsix players quite a bit is they just call here when i'm analyzing players who play micro stakes games and i'm going through their databases one of the things i do notice is that they they call here every single time and i go why do you do that and they say well i'm getting really good pod odds and i go okay so how do you know you're winning here and i think what do you mean and uh it's really neat with uh database management systems with uh hand history analysis tools now such as poker tracker holden manager three you can analyze these spots it's really cool so the filter you would look at in a database management tool would be razer plus caller and then call out of the big blind and what you're trying to do here is if you folded this hand your loss you would be losing a hundred big blinds per 100 hands because you're forfeiting the big blind every time every time so actually it's actually more than that because there's an annie but it's around that uh so you're trying to outperform that so let's say you're only negative 50 big lines per 100 when you call here that would be incredible that would be excellent so you're saving half the big blind there that's that's very good now unfortunately when i'm working with micro 6 players what we traditionally see here what i traditionally see there is sometimes my team helps me but in this one i usually run point um what you typically see is they're losing much more than if they just folded you see many micro six players losing here like 200 big blinds per 100 hands and if you can think back to your science class the way you would test anything is okay you remember the scientific method which was have a hypothesis run an experiment collect data then analyze the findings and then adjust your beliefs about the world not your beliefs that's the wrong word adjust your analysis adjust your analysis based on the new data be able to adjust what you see based on the data and what you're traditionally going to see is you've been running an experiment many people have been running an experiment and not even understanding it in that when they call out of here the experiment is okay with great pot odds price i i should be able to call here uh just indiscriminately and i should outperform a fold and if the data does not adhere to that conjecture then [Music] it's just an opinion it's an opinion not exactly based on anything so i'd very much recommend i i do notice the lower six players really lose their ass off especially in this situation it's it's just so difficult so you're gonna be out of position in a multi-way pot so you can't bluff and then even when you hit your hand it's a very weak hand so if the pot is getting bigger it's very unlikely to be the best hand and when you're just starting in micro 6 games that's it's very difficult at that time to know when a pair is good or not so it takes someone who's been playing for 10 20 years and they call out there yeah there's there's a good chance they could outperform a fold sure they're very good at turning some hands into bluffs and they're very good at knowing when their top pair isn't good anymore and so perhaps perhaps eeking out value in certain situations but i i'd say most of the players i see at this level what they're calling way way too much out of the big line this one's pretty close but i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't show it to you so here we have queen check off suit and it's been folded to you would you like to fold call arrays and all of these tournaments uh i mean i've said these are micro six tournaments but they're two dollar three dollar five dollar buy-ins okay time is up we're gonna go ahead and call here and this player raises here would you like to fold caller rights okay time is up we're gonna go ahead and move all in and this player folds so what's going on here this is one of the more fun plays and i did want to put it in here this is a very fun pre-flop exploit you can do at microsix games so i purposefully didn't give you a read here because i thought it'd be a little too easy at that point i mean it wouldn't have been that easy but i i wanted to up the difficulty a little bit you guys are ready for it you guys i know you guys you guys study i mean if you're if you're watching poker training videos in your free time you're way more hardcore than you realize most people you know the general public at your card room doesn't do that right sometimes this is something a lot of micro stakes players do as a mistake as well they project how they think about pokemon to everybody else they think that everybody else is thinking about the game critically most people are playing it like a table game so if you're listening to the sound of my voice and watching this video right now you are much more hardcore than you realize so i thought you guys were ready for this in this particular situation in micro six games you need to remember micro six players because it's a two dollar three dollar five dollar buy and they they're a little bit more flippant about their calls a little bit more flipping about their raises because it's fun it's a it's a lottery ticket if you lose three dollars it's not the end of the world so right here if you were to raise villain eight would have a clean all-in which would put you in quite the predicament because perhaps you don't want to call more than 20 big blinds with your queen jiakai if you raised here so causing you to raise fold a hand heads up which is very good heads up but instead what we do is a nice exploit here where we limp in you let him raise all his goofball hands just to attack you there because hey it's a two dollar tournament it's fun and then you just shut the door on him you want a nice little pond that that that ships you up quite nicely there so let's let's go ahead and try to work that into our games let's go ahead and work that into our game a little bit more so that's going to be our first little fun entry-level basic exploit that we're going to discuss today as far as how to exploit micro 6 players try to limb jam 20 to 30 x more from the small blind as you move up in stakes people are going to be a little more wary of that play so it's not nearly it's not going to work as much as he'd like but in these lower stakes tournaments it does work quite often let's uh continue if i can ever get my damn clicker to work uh villain 18 goes ahead and opens here and again it's a three dollar tournament you don't know a whole lot about anyone what would you like to do here would you like to fold call or raise and yeah the way this uh powerpoint presentation is going to work is if there's a fun little exploit you might not have seen before or maybe you just haven't been exposed to before or just a little one a nice one that you can use in micro six games i'll go ahead and highlight it like i just did there but if we're discussing fundamentals we'll just keep that to here so here what would you like to do speaking of fundamentals this is another one you see a lot of micro six players do which is okay i have king 10 off suit okay that flops pretty well i want to see the flop i'm getting a discounted price from the small blind all right i should go ahead and call here you need to know again when you collect data on this and you look at thousands of players damn near no one is making this profitable calling and under the gun raise from the small blind out of position in order to prove you were making this profitable you would have to outperform the fold here which would be negative 50 big blinds per 100 and i i see people negative 200 big lines from here negative 250 and we're talking sample sizes of years and years and years and years they just keep running that play that's what's so nefarious about nolan holdem is you can't remember the specific results because it happens over such a long period of time and it's not till somebody accumulates at all for you and shows you the numbers where you go oh my god so yeah most uh the vast majority of people do not outperform a fold here when a short stack raises from under the gun and i mean just to put this in more accessible terms i i'd like to let you know where i get my idea from so you know that i actually i do care enough to vet it out but if you think about it logically when you when you call here it's going to be very difficult to bluff because if you just lead out people are going to go well why did he lead out into me when he checked to me as the razor so so you'll check and then when you check if if you don't leave there a lot of people are just not going to believe it and if you check there well now if they do any kind of bet they're more or less committed and then it in at that point it's going to be very difficult to bluff them and then you got to ask yourself is villain 18 really raising like a k9 suited or a jack 10 offsuit from early position from that short of a stack because now if they're not doing that when we hit the flop we're not even really excited to have hit the flop because they likely if they're not opening hands we dominate if we hit the flop and they hit the flop they likely hit it a whole lot more and if we hit the flop and they didn't hit the flop well they're not going to be giving us much and if we miss the flop there's no real way for us to bluff but truthfully now if villain 18 was just opening all the time yeah sure i'm sure there was would be a way to make this work but the problem is most people will just see a guy open twice and because they want to see the flop they'll say oh of course he's opening too much uh now that being said villain 17 here has a really beautiful all in because villain 17 it could just increase their chips by damn a third if they shove over both of us if we call there and you could expect villain 17 to take that that line a lot in which case we're just never going to see the flop and that's going to be pretty pretty bad for us so that's uh that's a fundamental i want you guys to remember while you're playing micro stakes and villain 12 goes ahead and opens here would you like to phone call erase this is the same damn thing guys i didn't give you a whole lot of time on this one because you should be able to spot it where are you looking right now when you're playing micro stakes guys remember you're going to have short stacks to deal with all the time typically the structures are a little faster the lower the buy-in you got to look to your left so a lot of people go oh it's a 6-7 of spades it's so such a nice zone oh my god i want to see the flop with this and i get that it's a it's a pretty hand it does flop pretty well traditionally but what's the problem villain nine could move all on it all in on us very easily villain eight could move all in on us very easily villain 10 could move on all in on us very easily even villain 11 could possibly do it we're not going to see the flop that often and again i'm just going to keep saying it when you try to isolate these situations when it it sounds really you know like big high floating words like database analysis or whatever all it is is collecting [Music] you could do the same damn thing with a pen and paper just writing down the results of every time you do something and then averaging out the totals and see what it is and essentially all the software does is do that for you with hand issues and yeah it's just something i see all the time which is guys call here all the time and you you'll see them be negative 50 big lines negative 100 big blinds for every time they run that because if they fold it they'd just be negatively annie that's fine but what ends up happening the reason they lose so damn much is because somebody moves all in on them so often and then if you hit you're six or seven even if everybody folds behind you which would be great and now you hit your six or seven the big stack did open under the gun it's not unlikely he'd have a big card he connected with too so you don't even know if you want to connect with that so just taking that back to fundamentals folks so let's go ahead uh villain three in this situation uh villain three has been a little active and you have king jack off suit on the button what would you like to do here now that villain 3 has opened okay time is up if this one more time guys is going to be full so many times people are playing micro six tournaments it and it's very fun to get there get involved and to go after it and things of that nature and they'll say like oh i've seen this guy open a few times before you know we've only played like 11 hands and they've raised like four of them this guy's clearly a psychopath it's a little bit more likely the guy just picked up a few hands you know it's a it's really fun to say oh he's active okay i'm on the button oh i got to do something it's not necessarily the guy's still opening under the gun now if you if i had told you like i just saw this guy open six three suited from middle position or something like that in that case what do you do at that point you could three bet you could attack a little bit you you want to re-raise isolate when you have the best hand so typically when you have the best hand in your imposition you want the person to play a big pot with you out of position because out of position they're they they they have to act first the entire hand they give you so much information you could take a four-card flop whenever you want to essentially because most of them check to you 99 of the time now if they're operating with a three card flop and you're operating with a superior hand and a four card flop that's going to be pretty tough to deal with but that being said if you don't know a ton about the opponent and the person just opened from under the gun generally give the person the benefit of the doubt also the way you're actually going to get going in micro stakes games oftentimes is you'll have to play a number of them so i assume you're multi-tabling at this point so here you're not very sure you're not sure there's much profit to be gained here so i would look for a better opportunity on one of your other tables continuing here you have pocket queens now i think many of you are going to be raising here but the question is what would you like to do here with 15 big blinds would you like to go all in would you like to min raise would you like to make it 3.5 would you like to raise the 10k i was playing a charity tournament yesterday and that was how a gentleman liked to play this spot full coal or raise time is up so guys this is a very fundamental exploit we can use in micro stakes this is i'm trying to balance this lesson here with a lot of fundamentals you're gonna need for the rest of your life if you're gonna play poker up as a serious hobby or as a serious endeavor of any kind i'm trying to work in some of the fundamentals that are you know they take a little bit of work but some of these are so quick and easy for micro stakes i i'm trying to put those in here too which is this one's really quick and easy guys which is when you're playing micro six and it's a two dollar tournament remember people are there to gamble don't get cute so let's say this was a 109 tournament and i shove 15x there in a lot of the training videos you guys see here remember when i'm at work and my colleagues are at work we do have to play as i record this i i this is sunday i just woke up early so i'm recording this so when when i'm done talking to you i'm going to go play my majors and i'm going to go play 500 buy-ins in 109s and 55s and things of that nature 215s and when i'm doing that well if you shove queens here i i don't expect someone if they got 200 on the line to look down at their fives and go yippy skippy let's get the money in so perhaps this might not be the way i play so if i were teaching you in a training video based on the 55s and the 109s and the 215s i reply i was playing or whatever it was you might not see this move but this is why we have to do a specific video for you and your microsix games you guys gotta remember in microstakes games they're there to gamble they're there to play now a lot of those folks play home games primarily they'll play like charity poker tournaments they'll play uh things of that nature uh there's entire scenes in cities where people just go to bars and play like 10 20 buy-ins that's their thing that's the way they pass time you know some people some people like sports some people like hiking some people just very much love social relaxed poker now when they get that poker itch and there's not a game on a tuesday night or something and they go online they're going to be playing the two dollar binds the three dollar buyings the five dollar buy-ins and at some point you know it gets a little deeper in the tournament they go okay i should probably get back to hanging out with my spouse and kids uh let's try to get a let's try to rustle up a stack here or just call it and you move all in and they got a pair or they got like you know a suited ace and they'd go okay cool cool let's just go with it and they don't begrudge you for having the better hand they're gambling with you they're fine with that and you just got to remember that there's definitely a reason to get cute in higher buy-ins which is sometimes i'll do a smaller raise because one of the ways you can get people to over commit and say a 109 is sometimes the big one calls with way too many hands than they should and then they hit any pair and versus the short stack they're just not folding you'll see that more in high higher six tournaments uh if you can find the soft spot in the big line and whatnot that being said you just don't need to bother with a two dollar three dollar tournament because you can expect a lot of like if i moved all in in a 109 here i wouldn't expect villain 18 to just go get it in with my fives right with all these other players back behind but instead in micro stakes we can collect nicely right there so let's go back to this slide here where i'm keeping my non-fundamentals uh easier exploits listed out just so you have an easy way to remember them as you go play micro stakes so how to exploit micro six players we already discussed lim jamming 20 to 30 x more from the small blind but also jam those 14 to 22 x stacks more with big hands these players love to gamble and you'll have an edge you'll you're gonna get called by hands you don't expect to get called by so keep it up continuing and here villain 19 goes and limps in and you have ace queen offsuit on the button what would you like to do here and again you don't know a whole hell of a lot about any of these players if if i have a note i'll read it out to you guys but most of the time you don't know a ton about these people okay that is it i gotta i gotta do my job guys fundamentals fundamentals so first of all i see a lot of you folks limping in here when you play micro sex don't do that you likely got the best hand it's like final jeopardy and you know the topic put all the money down come on it's like your topic on jeopardy go to the highest ticket and run it this is your game you have ace queen off suit it's very likely to be the best hand so when you raise here though how much would you want to raise to so you limp for 400 you have 16 000 so i see a lot of you folks right it's the 1200 or 1600 here i i'd very much recommend you raise you raise bigger because these players love to limp call once they limp why did they lamp do you remember your first home games you limp because you want to see the flop now when somebody raises you you don't go well i guess i don't want to see the flop anymore no you still want to see the flop so you're very likely to go ahead and call whatever the hell is out there and then you're playing a big old pot out of position and sometimes you'll get players to over commit and this is another example so we got another player to over commit with i mean if they think we're getting a little out of line there they can get it in there but many times versus a limp and a raise there the a7 might not be the greatest but that doesn't matter because the great thing about these players is they'll still just gamble with you villain 19 villa 9 someone's going to gamble with you so do raise those limps a little bit bigger because if everybody folds that's still fine you get three or four big blinds which hell some people that's their entire win rate for 100 hands and if you do get people to commit out of position and they limp called with a bunch of weak hands and you're playing a big pot in position with a superior hand heads up and remember they're probably going to check to you 98 of the time or whatever it is so you get a four card flop whenever you feel like it whereas they get a three card flop and you have the better hand to begin with and you get to see what they're doing i it's going to be very hard to lose with that edge so do remember to press your position right here we got the 7 8 of diamonds what would you like to do time is up did you want to play this hand slow down there cowbook look at okay so guys what do people want to move all in with it's usually like 15 to 25 big blinds something like that how many of those stacks do you have to your left right now you got you got what one two three four four of them you got you got a lot of people that five well here's the thing about micro six players if it's a little bit of a tougher site if we're being frank if you're playing with a number of euros who are currency leveraging or just folks who are currency leveraging anywhere because maybe two or three or five bucks isn't a ton of money to you and i but i've been in countries where that's you know the usd is pretty strong so you'll see folks taking this game pretty seriously now they'll know those players who take it a little bit more seriously whether they're in latin america or wherever and they're playing pretty hard they they know they're not supposed to be cold calling from a lot of these stacks but if they see you opening a little too much which they'll likely pick up on if you're the type to be opening this willy-nilly they're going to put in their 24x stack their 26x stack and things of that nature now if you're playing with let's say you're playing a very loose passive american facing an anonymous site should you open this hand those players aren't as likely to move all in on you well you'd prefer to have big cards because the stacks are pretty short right now so your implied odds aren't great so all those nice straights and flushes you want to make on the turning river we're not loving the odds we're getting to draw to him we we would much rather have say a king jack off suit here because if we get top pair versus another short sack and we get it in it's going to be pretty difficult to make a huge mistake there especially if that person let's say it's a loose passive player and they just cold call too much and you hit top pair if you take a look at their typical cold calling range and you see you know your top pair versus it you can get a lovely piece of software called flopzilla if you'd ever like to try this out and what you'll just see is you have a ton of equity versus all those ranges with the top pair so getting the money in on the flop is fine whereas you'll see if you're drawing you don't have as much equity and then you know it's likely going to be all in on the flop if the person hit something pretty decent that's what loose passive players do with their short sex okay let me see the flop okay i hit the flop okay let's go yeah that's when you get into a lot of trouble so be very careful in this spot here you have ace 10 of spades don't know a whole lot about villain 26 melon 26 has gone ahead and raised all right that's time don't be afraid of the big all-in guys there's no law that says you can't you got you have to have less than 20 big lines to move all in this is a slam dunk all in most micro six players will open way too much from the button i see a lot of you folks just call there to see a flop because you're scared to play until you hit the flop when you if you move all in here and you pick up all the money going from 9k and change to 11k and change at 200 400 is a nine day difference you get all these new tools in the tournament you got the check raise working for you now you got the three bet working for you now you got a little double barrel action working for you now you can thread some of these short stack players you can put them on the back foot you want to take those tools all right here you got the queen jack off suit it's on you fundamentals guys fundamentals you should have known it by now what am i about to say well you don't want to raise there and let them move all in with their king four suited that's a better hand than yours you know i want to raise there and let them shove their ace two off suit that's a better hand than yours put the pressure on them make them call off for all their chips especially if it's right before the bubble bursts see if they got it there's no law that says you can't you can only open jam 10 big blinds or less 15 big blinds or less you can put in more than that this is totally fine and then okay you're going to get caught sure it's going to happen but guess what in no limit oldham i've been informed that the bad beats and backgammon are something like 5 000 won but in no limit to hold him it's so funny if this happens live like where you turn the queen villain 30 will act as if this is the worst thing that's ever happened to them which is i want your life if this was that bad now but you you're never that big of a dog in no limit hold him so you should be gambling you should be pressuring even in the worst situations pre when you're just pre-flop dominated you still got a one out of five shot if i was running a parlor game where i put a ball underneath one dixie cup out of five and then you came into the room and i said randomly pick which one do you think has the ball underneath it and you picked you happened to get lucky and you picked the one with the ball underneath out of the five dixie cups and i went oh my god oh my god this is so sick this is ridiculous oh my god how you're so lucky this is such a joke i would sound like a crazy person and that's but you got to remember you got to put you got to put the pressure on them because there's a pretty good chance you still have a ton of equity even when you're called and if you win this pot just before the bubble bursts like you get people always ask how do i get a big stack on the bubble how do i get a big stack going into the money it's like you got to be you got to be putting the pressure on that and putting all the pressure of like do you want to cash all right good luck choose shoot risk your tournament risk your possible min cash all right you got to put the pressure on them and then if they do buck up if they do wake up with a hand remember you're never that big of a dog and if you win that pot boy it's going to be real fun from that point on all right that's it for pre-flop let's go on the flop all right let's get into some of these flop situations so here villain six has opened on the button i'm not in love with calling here but i know a lot of you folks do so just typically with short sex guys you want big cards if you're going to play short stack pots heads up you want big cards because you make a big pair you and you get it in when the stacks are short it's going to be pretty hard to do that incorrectly now with three high it's going going to be exceedingly difficult to hit a big pair me thanks so the board comes 10-5-5 and you get a nice little flush draw what would you like to do here check them out if you do want to call here let's at least do it right time's up we check and this player fires k it is on you full call arrays time is up we're going to go ahead and raise here now this is a more basic exploitative exploitable play that we should do a little bit more versus micro six players so the thing you need to know about micro six players is when it gets folded around to them on the button they they want to play so bad because poker they're still recreational players and poker still very fun for them that they just open way too much from the button and then when a very hit or miss board like this comes out where it's pretty unlikely for you to have flopped anything they're gonna fire pretty much just a hundred percent of the time so there's many times versus more balanced play players here where i i would just say just call just because oftentimes they'll not be bluffing such a high percentage of the hands that you really are incentivized to just cash in your equity at this juncture or just you know check check when you check race here you're you this gets bricked the board like 70 percent of the time given how wide open his ranges are so you just cash in and then a lot of times micro six players will just be like well i don't want to fool my king jack damn it and then they call and then they miss the turn you shove uh or whatever it is yeah pretty much a shot of it then they go damn it and then they fold and that's just so much money but if you're dealing with a more balanced player when you move up they're checking back some hands for paw control they're checking back once in a while uh as a give up and they're betting sometimes as a bluff but a lot of times they actually have some kind of hand they're trying to work with well versus them a lot of times you can check call once then if it gets checked if it goes check check on the turn you know they've messed with a lot of their c bet blocks and you can lead river as the out of position float and look a lot like a 10 and they'll be able to read the line and just fold to you whereas micro six players they're not doing that they're not going to read your line like they're they're not that good at that so you can you can just go ahead and take the fight to them in that particular situation so here you do have a lamp and you do have another person all in for 48 ships what would you like to do here with fives all right that's time and villain 12 has been limping quite often i change your answer we're going to go ahead and raise here in villain 12 calls and the board comes king 76 here would you like to check her back time is up we go ahead and check here and villain 12 fires here would you like to fold call or raise okay that is time we're gonna go ahead and fold and what's going on here guys whenever there's a really short stack player all in and a micro six player gets to see your hand anyway they'll often be much more casual about folding because a lot of micro six players they just want to see your hand that's you even hear them say that when they do play live like that on the river they'll even tell you i just gotta see it i just gotta see it so if there's a very short stack there and they'll get to see your hand anyway they'll fold a little bit more pre-flopping on the flop now here you do need to know sometimes you'll get an atrocious board and you gotta pump the brakes but there's a good thing here what is it if a player's been limping a lot that's probably because they're a more passive player and passive players don't bluff as much and passive players let's say here you got some showdown value obviously three to a straight flush you want to see the turn in rubber and micro six players they'll just let you see it they're just not gonna be bluffing as much as they should it so you'll be able to get to a lot of showdowns so you don't have to attack this board now i did check fold and he did have king of clubs so there you go and here we have 10 nine of hearts villain four goes ahead and opens now villain four has been helping quite a bit we go ahead and call here a little bit of a dangerous call with that short stack villain one being sure but he'd been doing a lot of this which was just calling all the time when he should be moving all in or folding so we go ahead and take the wrist sure enough we get a nice big multi-way pot now villain two goes in and leads into you here on this board what would you like to do here with the 1090 hearts full color rates let's get to work guys and gals poker lessons can run you 400 an hour you're just grinding right now and grinding you're learning how to play better focus feedback fix it let's get to work okay so a lot of people do want to call there but you want to be careful because villain one is if villain one's gonna do anything with that shortsick oftentimes they're just gonna shove and then that's going to reopen the action and villain 2 will likely blast you off the hand so with the two over cards and the back door flush draw and the gut shot it's very tempting to call there but you need to remember micro six players love getting it in all the time when they've hit anything on the board and you'll see micro six players how many times as come on guys you know this has happened villain one shoves there then villain two re-isolates and then you see villain one's hand and you're like why would you re isolate with that and it's like jack seven of clubs right but guys that's on us we need to know micro six players are trying this is their mo they want to see the flop and then if they kind of hit it in any fashion a lot of times as they're short they want you know they want to go watch netflix they want to go watch the game whatever it is and they're just going to put it in there so it's on us to be it's on us to be wary of that now if you call there that's certainly not a bad play it's just we i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't tell you guys in microsix tournaments that this is their mo see the flop somewhat hit the flop get the money in on the flop with any kind of short stack so you need to be wary of that and this was a specific situation where that came up so here you have a7 off suit facing a raise from villain 40. again you don't know a ton about this player so we're going to go ahead and call here and the board comes ace six the board comes jack six seven sorry before comes jackson seven is back to checkerbot okay that is time we go ahead and check here and this player bets 2.7 k would you like to fold call arrays all right that's it this one is a fairly easy fold what what does it mean guys when micro 6 players bet really big on a board like this what does that mean typically if they raise from early position and did you notice the person raised into a bunch of people that could move all in on them let me double check i got that right so i didn't highlight this but okay so yeah this person can move all in on them this person can move all in on them this person can move all in on them this person can move all in on them this person could move all in on them so when you see that you have to call here but you're going uh that's probably a decent hand so you're looking for an excuse to not get involved so here you flop second pair and you're going oh i do have to get involved here typically but the person lets you off the hook when they bet pot because that's typically okay if a person raced into all those people who could move all in and now they're just bombing the pot on a three to a flush board they're telling you almost every single time this is just i have queens and damn it we're getting this money in and you're not gonna beat my overpair again i've been waiting so long i've been so disciplined i i've been for some reason micro six players are just everybody when they start playing poker they think even though there's nine people at the table and if you think about it logically it's far more likely on almost every single deal one of those eight people will have a better hand than you for some reason micro six players are all of us if we're being honest when we first start playing poker if we don't if we don't get dealt a premium every single hand and have it hold up we for some reason think the world's out to get us or we're super unlucky i was playing a charity tournament yesterday i was taking a friend of mine to a charity tournament because he wanted to learn a little bit about cards and i said well it's not going to get easier than a charity tournament so let's go ahead and do that and i finished third he's like first game in like 15 years aside from just like playing with friends or something but uh that's beside the point he uh i was five hands in five hands in to the day and two three players at my table started talking about all the bad cards that we're getting they really do expect to get dealt premiums from the start now if god forbid they gotta wait 31 minutes before they get a premium which is just every day of no limit hold them that's how random distributions work it's about you that's that that's even a little out of schedule getting a premium every half hour so whatever it is they think because they've waited half an hour i mean my god that's one ren and stimpy episode that's forever they they think they deserve to win dammit with their premium so this board comes out there and this is a board you're not if i check shove on this board you're not loving your queens with no spade but they're not folding because damn it this hand should be good and i'm not gonna let you suck out on me again and even if they lose it's not their fault at their point it's your fault for playing a stupid hand but this person lets you off the hook when you got a mediocre hand here this person is clearly just bombing it's probably a pretty good pair it your seven is not worth anything anymore they're going you're not hitting that damn spade damn it my hand i've waited you know 19 whole minutes for this hand and i'm so deserving of a big pot because i'm so moral and patient that we're gonna go ahead and just play for stacks because i deserve this pot right now and if you're gonna have to pay a lot of money if you think you're gonna suck out on me mister and that's your cue to exit stage left ace 10 middle position full color raise i think most of you are raising here and i hope you all notice there's not many short stacks behind you villain 21 goes ahead and calls and the board comes king nine three three clubs and villain 21 leads 750 would you like to fold call a raise five more seconds okay time is up we are going to raise here to 2.5 k and this player folds how do we know this is likely to not be the hand so first of all in micro six games there's a reason it's called the donk lead it used to be a joke only a donkey would lead here because most players in position are going to make an assumption which is a pretty good idea to assume which is hold on i'm the pre-flop razor if this person really did flop a flush or flopped two pair or some strong hand wouldn't they check to me and let me fire so they could build some kind of a pot when you lead out there it makes a little less sense with a big hand you take that play away from me so what that means is it's very likely that this is someone testing the water that means this is someone who wants to see where they're at that means this is someone who wants to see maybe if i take a cheap shot at this board i could take this away now sometimes you'll see some good players donk lead it's not a super balanced play but it works pretty well as an exploitative play versus a number of players because especially live you can get great reactions out of people if you donk lead real quick that'll help you curtail the range quite quite a bit but that being said you when you see better players donkly what do they tend to do differently a lot of so let's say a guy here wanted to donk lead as a bluff and they were a slightly better player they might lead 1500 or something along those lines maybe 2250 or something that be pretty hard for us to deal with as the in position player when a person donk leads small and you're already at a buy in level where it's micro stakes to begin with it's very likely that this is just someone who wants to see if they can get you to fold to any kind of bet so we are not going to respect this now what happens is a lot of the times people who watch poker on streaming sites they see that versus most donk leads most people just call because that tends to be a little bit more of a well-constructed range when you're playing against better players you do not have to respect these players this donk lead is very likely to be a very weak exploitative play by this person they're hoping you're multi-tabling you look down at your hand you don't have a whole lot and you fold a little too much and to be fair when they bet so small their bet doesn't need to work that often you're going to be better than that and with a large percentage of your continuing range you are going to go ahead and raise here so going back to our list of exploits we're going to be using a stakes tournaments and i tried to make these simple so everybody could get something from this video even if you're new to poker we're happy to have you here if you're playing for the first time i'd recommend or if you're new to the game i'd recommend these plays to exploit your opponents they're easy to implement limp jam 20 to 30 x or uh more from the small blind jam 14 to 22 xx more with big hands these players love to gamble and raise weak small donk leads frequently they're likely bluffs now if someone does do a weak small donk lead and then they call when you raise fairly quickly what is that guys a lot of the times that's a weak pair so if your hand on the turn you run into something that's a lot better than a lot of the weaker hairs on that board a lot of the weaker pairs on that board don't be afraid to charge them and get some money from them continuing we have pocket tens here now i think most of you are raising this so we'll skip past that part of the test and villain 19 calls you here now the board comes queen 10 4 villain 9 checks to you here here would you like to check or bet 10 seconds time is up if you did want to bet here how much did you want to bet the right idea here is to bet larger now we bet larger here and he folds how does that make you feel most people do not want to do large bets because it's more fun to show down our hands we feel superior when we get to show down a big hand doing a really big bet and everybody folds that doesn't feel great but you got to think of it within the term of percentages so let's say what does villain 19 likely continue with well micro six players if they flop a pair they pretty much always continue and when they miss the board they fold too much and this is a board where if you add a random aci you're not that excited about it because it's fairly coordinated but if this person has a queen or a 10 or even a four they're probably calling the first bat regardless of what you put out there so if you could bet many people would bet one third pot here 800 let's say you get called there 100 of the time which is not true okay so let's say you bet 800 there but you get called 100 of the time so your expectation is 800 but let's say if you bet 1575 you get called there 90 of the time 80 of the time it's still going to out earn the bet that succeeds 100 of the time on average it's just you're gonna have to deal with it when you fire your set pretty big and the person folds and then yeah the peanut gallery would always tell you oh man you fired too big you shouldn't have done that but what they don't see is now look i'm i i play against a lot of weak players that is my 90 of my job is game selection i like to play against weaker opposition a lot like your micro six opposition i can tell you when they flop pairs they have a hard time folding everybody says the same damn thing to me these people never fooled and then they'll flop a set on a board where people are calling you with king jack jack nine spade drugs ten nine ten eight jack kington ace ten queen eight suited queen nine off queen jack off queen 10 off king queen off uh ace four five four six four suit seven four suited that they're colony with all these hands and they go oh man these players never fooled quick bet one fourth pot get real cute the name of the game is taking other people's trips that's what you're here for you're not here to show down hands to show everybody how awesome you are you're here to make money and if that means once in a while you're cracking a couple of eggs to make an omelette so be it you want to put these big bets out here when on this board let's be honest guys calling with a high card is not fun because it's such a coordinated board your opponent's probably just gonna call you with the pairs and they're probably not folding regardless of what you put out there with their pairs because they can always justify to themselves like maybe he's got a draw so you gotta go for it and that brings us to another exploit i want you guys using with micro six players we'll go through all of these again before we wrap up today but right now when they flop pairs they can't fold so bet big and don't be worried if they fold they likely just missed the board and they were gonna fold anyway it shouldn't make you feel any kind of way when they flop pairs they can't fold so bet big so if you're on a flop where it's really unlikely anyone was gonna call you with high cards anyway bet bigger because it's mostly going to be the pairs that are going to continue and they're not that sensitive in regards to the bet size they just like to continue they like to get to showdowns it's fun it's like they're home games it's like a casino game continuing got the queen jack off suit here guys are sufficiently deep so you raise here villain two re-raises now villain 2 has been a little lively has been a little gung-ho all right what do you want to do here full color rays okay that's time we decide to call and the board comes seven nine ten and this player bets would you like to full color raise versus this aggressive player 10 seconds all right that's time if you did want to raise here what did you want to raise too go ahead and raise to ten thousand here because here's the deal you're willing to get this money all in anyway with the over cards and the open-ended straight draw versus a very loose aggressive player that's fine that's fine but you need to know micro stakes players like to gamble so if you just shove here what they're gonna see a lot of the time is draw and now you've given them a license to call off with their sixes or their a7 suited or whatever it is if you make them hit the all in button with those weak pairs they're going to have a much harder time doing it i used to shove here not understanding how loose recreational players thought and i would be flabbergasted when they beat me into the pot with ace kick but you need to know if they sh if you shove here they're thinking draw because they want an excuse to continue playing and it'd be fair to the guy he's amassed all these trips and maybe he wants to gamble and that's his prerogative but you need to help him find the exit you raise bigger here and you hit make them hit the all in button with the ace queen or the sixes or something like that they're not going to find that as easily now on this one we did get it in and i think i won this one so just a total so as you can see yeah we had him pre-flop uh on the flop we're we're both getting that money and as you can see he was goofing off with uh toward me quite a bit during that day and you got to be ready to gamble you got to be ready to gamble when you're playing with recreational players because remember that's how some of these folks blow off steam they got a tough job they got a tough gig they're taking care of their kids this is how they relax and sometimes online they get a little bit more wily than they would be live where people had to would be able to talk to them or whatever it is all right let's uh let's keep it going let's keep drilling this time we got a lip from villain five we're in the small blind here what would you like to do we're going to go ahead and limp here as well if you said raise that's fine the board comes jack 73 would you like to check or bet time's up we check comes around the villain five building five bets what would you like to do here you go ahead and call the turn is the ace of diamonds do you like to check or bet time is up go ahead and check here this player bets 5.2 k it's on you full color red 10 seconds okay that's time i'm gonna go ahead and fold here let's discuss another way you can exploit these players so most your job and element hold them is getting people to pay off your value bets the biggest pots you're going to win are going to be when you secure a river bet that's bigger than all the other bets combined and you can't secure a river bet with a bluff so the way you're going to secure that river bet is by value betting now the name of the game is getting them to call you with as crappier hands as possible so you can value that with as many decent second pairs and weak top pairs as possible if you're like every other player who waits tell us they get a set once a session decides to start value betting you're not going to get where you want to get in all of it hold them the great thing about low stakes players microsix players they like to call all the time they love to call they don't like folding folding is a guaranteed loss that's boring they don't want to do that so what you're doing a lot of the time is trying to play big pots heads up in position with superior hands now notice i didn't say premiums i said superior hands you just have to have superior hands to the person you're playing against so if you've got a guy opening 6-3 suited and what not you can three bet jack 10 off as a value bet if they're just going to raise call you with 6i and then you can start shelling them once you [\xa0__\xa0] you flop some pairs it's a high variance way to play it's worked for me for decades the big blind keeps calling you nobody's three betting you you just keep opening and getting that big blind play you with fifty percent of the hands and you just keep value betting them to death death by a thousand cuts you keep going at them you got a thousand spots you got a thousand spots with weak players the only way you're gonna give it away is letting these people take it from you when they finally decide to play pot now if most of these players are loose passive that means they escape your purview most of the time they expect they escape your notice because aggressive players you know are aggressive 55 minutes in 15 minutes in because they get attention now if someone's lose passive and all of a sudden they get very interested in a pot you should get very wary this person normally doesn't like playing why are all these big bets going in if someone is a bluffer you're going to catch them bluffing nobody bats a thousand nobody pitches a perfect game you will see bluffs at some point you haven't seen bluffs out of a guy in fact you haven't even seen aggression that could have been a bluff they don't deserve your money they don't deserve your bets they didn't do anything to earn it you got your wheelhouse you with your three bets where you're targeting people with your raises where you're getting the big blind out there with too many hands it's like a martial artist the better a martial artist gets the less moves they need a great boxer can beat you to death with just the jab and the cross now if you're a weaker fighter you're going to try to draw them out into a firefight the dumbest thing a great martial artist a great boxer could do is just get into that firefight but the smart ones will stay on the outside like sorry i will beat you to death with the fundamentals i will beat you to death with the basics that's what we're trying to be now this guy's trying to draw you out into a firefight this is a fire fight so i was a little wary when he limped this guy wasn't doing that that often but i didn't say that before the start of the hand because honestly you can fold here always what's the most important thing to be asking yourself before you make a big call and this is a big call what do you have to ask yourself first thing you should ask yourself is does he do this with x and x is the best value hand that you beat so what would that be jack 9 suited tens that doesn't make a whole lot of sense he's playing that hand pretty strong for an ace being on the board it's not impossible it's just not that likely by the way guys there's a lot of times people play poker and they want to be perfect there are no good options here every we are comparing two options folding which sucks and calling which sucks the question is which one sucks more let's avoid that there is not a third hypothetical situation where the guy suddenly takes the bet back and then there's a showdown right here on the turn and we get to see if our hand is good or not that does not exist so if you're looking for that do not expect it it doesn't happen if you don't like any way to play the hand don't opt for the one that at least gives you a showdown so you can sleep well at night that's how good players take advantage of you why do you think netflix shows you the cliffhanger and then just starts playing the next episode humans abhor an open loop in their heads if i tell you a joke without a punch line it's going to drive you crazy if you hear the tune to a song that you grew up with but you can't name the artist it'll drive you insane humans hate that open loop so they'll pay good cash money to close it by calling down when they should not your options suck here one option sucks but you'll get to see what the guy has and then you can i don't know some people like to think some people i really think get a thrill out of thinking they're unlucky they really get something from that and i don't understand that they really love it it's uniquely not their fault and they'll call down just to see the person's hand they'll give away their money just to see the person's hand so one option sucks but it gives you the payoff of a closed loop so you don't have to wonder at night like did that guy bluff me and the other one sucks but there's an open loop now the question is which one sucks less in which one will cost us the least amount of money and which one logically should we be pursuing so again i'm gonna say it again do not expect perfection from a game of chance there's a reason people do this at four in the morning while drinking whiskey and barely avoiding fist fights and screaming at each other it is gambling things happen now thankfully we can do it on the internet it's a little bit more hygienic than the check cashing places i played in the back of growing up but it's still gambling so do not expect it to be perfect there is no third hypothetical beautiful option that saves us from how annoying this spot is so remove that from your mind now let's get back to business he does a big bet does he value bet anything worse maybe but probably not that seems pretty odd for someone to play tens or jack 9 like that most of these players love to see showdowns and if they have a mediocre hand that's a perfect time to get to a showdown so is this a value hand we beat most likely not okay how about a draw now a lot of people are fixating on that yeah that's it he's got a diamond draw how many combos is that how many combos if you don't know it off the top of your head you probably should not be gambling on it just for reference every one of the combos is one it's one king ten of diamonds that's one eight nine in diamonds that's one how many combinations is an ace there it's a whole lot more i'd recommend you get a copy of flopzilla if you want to get down to this and it's a there's a lot more there are far far far more combinations of aces there than there are flush draws so okay could it be a flush off maybe maybe but there's not many of them okay is he turning a pair into a bluff then now that actually does happen with low six players sometimes but if you haven't seen them getting aggressive before it's unlikely to have happened and is it an absolute bluff it's the same thing asking ourselves is it an absolute bluff it's the same thing if we haven't really been noticing this person then not and one of these things you might have it right now but why would you give them the satisfaction why would you do that to yourself why would you get out of line like that you're going to beat them up with the fundamentals by the way the hands not over if you call here guys there's still a river to play you gotta let this one go so let's go back to the big board of exploits and discuss this one put it simply when loose passive players start bombing the pot get the hell out of there if you have not noticed them before that means they're probably not that aggressive which means there wasn't even an opportunity for them to be bluffing earlier it's very unlikely this is their first bluff it's possible it's just not likely so you're not going to gamble on it it's like a pitcher who throws a really terrible breaking ball five percent of the time could you knock that one out of the park yeah should you be looking for it no why because 19 out of 20 times it doesn't come if he's got a mediocre fastball that's the one you're looking at if he throws that sixty percent of the time what's their mediocre pitch they can't call down correctly they don't know how to do it they just call down all the time so just focus on that when loose passive players start bombing the pot get the hell out of there now if you see something you see some kind of bluff you see them getting aggro you see them consistently too not like no showdowns they played a few parts aggressively because that's most likely the hand but if you see them get caught bluff and you see that kind of thing then by all means start calling it down okay continuing all right guys let me show you how to do this on flopzilla real quick so the board came uh the way we did this the board came three seven jack the person limped in so we put their hand there over here we put jack ten hearts the person limped in we check called let's assume they take a shot with the entirety of their range on the flop because it's a pretty hit or miss board now that's not totally accurate but i by the way guys this is just a thought experiment i'm not saying this is 100 accurate i'm saying this is how you would do it at home right you can adjust any assumption i'm making here really i'm making assumptions for the purpose of expediency is that the five dollar word for that but to be quick so all right so he fires so we put a blue filter next to everything air and okay then we turn this from red to grain now he fired all of that turns the ace of diamonds as you can see our equity is pretty swell here all right 73 percent things are looking good ace of diamond comes not good all right so he fires again now what is he firing let's go through arranging uh now a set two pair yeah okay and i i got him limping so so typically this is another thing guys loose passive players low six players in casinos or micro stakes they tend to raise their best hands in limp they're good in mediocre hands and then they fold their crap so i tried to make the limping range what i thought was like good in mediocre hands and as you can see he's there's no ace king kings queens ace queen suited because those are the hands most of them raised so he fires on that turn so yeah it's gonna be sad yeah it's gonna be two pair yeah it's gonna be top pair and then we didn't really think he'd fire middle pair because he'd probably try to get that to a showdown and then okay cool we'll give him some uh draws and you know we'll give him you know the five four suited there okay so we're getting giving him a bunch of draws and like top hair better when we do that you just see our equity just just hit the floor at 22 now and a lot of people fixate on oh man he's got a lot of flush draws there too right the name of the game isn't put the guy on one category a hand you're ahead against right now and then continue and put lots of money in that that's not the name of the game the name of the game is obviously looking at the entirety of his range and asking how it's going to play now what you're going to notice is we're not doing so hot and like i said every diamond draw you can think of you can see it it's one combo you see that little one underneath the six four suited that little one underneath the six five suited that's one combo now let's go up to the ace queen off he might have limp now that's nine combos look at that ace jack even the one we're blocking that's five now look at the ace ten that's another seven and don't forget there's the ace jack suit it's the ace ten suit it's the ace nine the all the suited aces that's a lot of them man it's a lot of them so as you can see if we're going like oh yeah he could have draws like this is a time a person could have a lot of drugs like i'm trying to give him a lot of draws here there's no indication he 100 limps six four of diamonds or something like that but you'll even see then it's only about a quarter of the time he's got all that and that means the other 75 of the time we are just screwed and by the way he gets to hit he gets to see the river if we call we all catch that right the hand's not over so yeah we're not looking so hot okay continuing final note on that hand guys because this is a big one like if i could remove one error from all my friends and my students who are getting into micro stakes low stakes because low stakes casino tournaments things of that nature it's when loose passive players finally get active that's usually because they had a pretty big hand just because he had top pair on the flop doesn't mean you need to continue this would be the one i would tell them the most like it's okay to not pay off nut peddlers it's just fine you'll go home your bed's still going to be there your bagel's going to taste the same in the morning your coffee is still going to be there for you nothing bad is going to happen and once again i hope you noticed we needed 30 equity on that turn to call if you were saying we got a call there but you didn't know what equity you needed what you likely had or even just a guesstimate or anything like that if we didn't even realize like holy smokes even when we call here he still gets to see the river if we weren't thinking through all of that we were we were just getting out a lot we were just purely saying i thought my hand was good on the flop and damn it it should still be good on the fl on the turn and that's not how poker works things change all the time so here you have ace king villain 11 opens on you full color red that is time go ahead and raise it up this person calls and the board comes ace queen seven so here would you like to check our bet time is up we check here and villain 11 checks back turn is the three of diamonds would you like to check her bet time is up go ahead and fire 6.5 k and this person folds so a couple of notes here i'm trying to trying to give you some work you you were kind enough to show up here today you were ready to train so i'm here to let's get the work in i i want the work to be good you know your time is valuable so let's get as much as possible out of it so here i went for a play i went through a micro sex play i love i do this a lot in casino tournaments here so you check here and a lot of guys who are just getting into the game they think a check is like oh cool he missed and they just they fire a lot of hands they should check back here like if you got eights here with the eight of diamonds you probably shouldn't be firing that's a pretty bad board but a lot of the times you you'll be playing like a 50 100 casino tournament or just the three dollar tournament online you check to someone they go yippee skippy and they fire and you just jam and then they go uh-oh okay cool and you'll get a lot of weak bet calls from just crappy aces and crappy queens essentially the rule is with micro stakes low six players if they can put you on a draw they're calling so when there's a draw out there you're trying to maximize the money going in when you have especially a top pair top kicker now when he checks back there that is a lot of crap that's a lot of because the person probably would have bet a lot of their really good aces and probably would have bet their draws so we're not that maybe not but a lot of them they didn't and remember there's not many combos to begin with so when they check back there what is that well that's a lot of really crappy aces queens and yeah just some mediocre pairs that didn't take the bank so we don't want to bet our hand here so a lot of times people go crap he checked back okay 10k no no no no your hand's easy to play it's right in front his hand their hand is very important to you your hands right in front of you you know what it is what's their hand they just told you it's terrible so we do a bet that works with micro six players we just do the same bet as before before in a lot of the times that will get them and didn't work that time let's go with the ace nine one player raises another player calls let's go full color raise i did some simple exploits but now we're gonna work let's play some streets we go ahead and call here board comes 6 8 10. check check and oh excuse me check are villain 20 on you you decide to check there villain 19 checks and the turn is the five what would you like to do here a few more seconds to check to you here would you like to check about time is up we check this player checks river is the king of diamonds villain 20 checks it's on you would you like to check or bet 10 seconds time is up here and this player bets would you like to fold call or raise 15 seconds 10 five zero all right you're going to fall there all right guys now what is going on here i'm testing you i'm testing you so often when you take a test from a poker coach every play is going to end up being some big old bluff big old value bet some exciting and well guess what a lot of your work is not going to be like that so you might have been thinking to yourself oh i blocked the nut flush ooh maybe an over bet will do some no not with micro sticks players they don't fold you guys tell me that to begin with they do not fold if they will not fold do not bluff unless it's a specialized good situation you know it's not a specialized good situation it's going to be a multi-way board on a super connected flop because most likely someone hits something and they're not going to be folding let's go again did i get you to fall for that one all right let's pick up the tempo i think you all are ready for it so we raise our ace jack here and villain 26 calls villain 28 calls the board comes queen a2 villain 28 checks to you would you like to check or bet time is up go ahead and check here film 26 checks back the turn is the six of hearts building 28 leads here would you like to full color raise this one is very close but something i want you to know about microsix players they struggle bluffing they very much struggle bluffing so if they got a weaker ace high there they gotta draw a lot of times they're just gonna check and see if they can get it to showdown so you're up against a stronger range there than you realize you still got a player left act behind now the person could be poking around with whatever but with one player to act behind you can let it go and i i wouldn't get overly involved in these multi-way pots because you see a lot of people lose their ass off there and most of the time in multi-way pots with weak players they're going to check too much and let you realize your equity so when they're firing you you can let him take it wouldn't do much it's a small point but i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't bring it up so here you raise the king queen and you get called by a couple of people the board comes king jack seven villain 28 checks you here would you like to check a bet let's do a couple of multi-way pots because that's what you guys always tell me nobody ever folds to me well here we go let's drill it time's up now did you bet half pot did you bet 1100 1200 why would you do that what are they going to continue with are they going to continue with a6 of diamonds no that's a terrible board for a high card so what they're continuing with is pairs are they going to fold a pair to pretty much anything probably not i guess if you go over 2k you might lose a seven but you're probably not going to lose a king or a jack regardless of what you put out there so bet bigger when there's flush draws and straight jaws out there they're not folding pairs that's not what they signed up to do people play poker because i hope you're sitting down for this they like to play poker people gamble because again i hope you're sitting down this one might knock your socks off people gamble because they like to gamble nobody goes to the casino to watch other people play blackjack they came there to gamble themselves have you ever seen somebody go to the casino to watch somebody play slots no they're there to gamble themselves when they flop their pair the whole reason they called you pre-flop is they want to see if they hit the flop now that they hit the flop they're not out of there especially when they can put you on a draw get a little bit more money out of there alright so villain 28 calls and villain 28 bets on the ace of hearts turn on you full call or raise on your marks get set 15 seconds 10. cinco that's it you're cooked man it changed it's over such is life moving on whatever same thing same same thing we were discussing the last hand when loose passive players all of a sudden get very very interested that's going to be most your competition at microsex and truthfully that's going to be a lot of your competition in low six casino games if you're playing those as well if they all of a sudden get interested you gotta be a little careful it's okay just ask yourself some simple questions don't don't try to stare through the internet connection and get a soul read that's not gonna help you most likely most people when they're playing live they just go into a fugue state do i think my hand's good do i is it good god why didn't i say you know and it's not really conducive ask yourself some logical questions does he do this with x does he do this with the best hand that should be does he just up in league king 10 is he just up in lead queen jack now don't do this with me i i yeah i know i've seen people do that once once once once the exception proves the rule you remember it specifically because it's so odd other times you just call down here and the guy has a little flush you forget all those because it happens so many times so could this be a weaker hand probably but not probably not maybe but probably not okay is it a draw all the draws got there queen 10 got there hard drug got there so that's not good okay is he turning a pair into a bluff that i'd like to see that i'd like to see i've spent over a decade teaching poker players how to play do you know how hard it is to teach a guy how to turn his hand into a bluff nobody wants to do it if you do a bluff and you get caught you lose a big pot and everybody sees what happened if you do a bluff and it succeeds you win a smaller pot and nobody gets to know what a badass you are that's a negative emotional free role that most people won't engage in homo sapiens don't like that it is this just a high card is this like a 10 nine of diamonds again do you see how thin this sounds the more we think about it but you'll play with people you'll even play one two and people just call here like it's their job like yeah i got i got the second pair man it was top pair on the flop they'll even say that to you afterwards i had top pair on the flop like what does that have to do with anything the term brought in the flush rod the term brought in the stretcher or the term brought in an overcard this is a completely different situation all right let's keep it going a little bit more work before i get y'all out of here today here would you like to fold color rays if you just go ahead and fold when the short stack opens from under the gun that's totally fine now me i got a little bit of an ego so i decided to take a flop board comes 288 i know a poker player with an ego hope you were sitting down checkerbat that doesn't exist does it for the most humble folks in all of creation we check here villain 45 goes ahead and bets 1.6 on you full color raise that is time go ahead and call here the turn is the jack of diamonds would you like to check about that's it go ahead and check here this player checks back river is the king of diamonds here would you like to check or bet 10 seconds time is up very micro stakes play here but here's the deal if you wanted to make an argument for turning your hand into a bluff on this river that's a pretty crappy board run out pretty bad if you thought your opponent was paw controlling with some crappy pairs yeah all right you got a point i'm not saying that's what i would do i'm saying you have a point if the player was a touch more sophisticated if they were the type of person who for whatever reason you thought i was gonna fold nines or tens or sevens or whatever there if you thought this person just a lot of the time you could get that play over on them you might have a point that being said you have a lot more showdown value than you ever realize in micro six tournaments and you have a lot less bluff equity than you realize one because they check solid hands all the time and two if you shove there's no indication folding damn near anything so take the showdown on this one and probably you shouldn't play this one pre-flop i was multi-tabling a few of these trying to get hands for you guys but i thought that was a good example because what please don't bluff people who don't fold i know kind of crazy but i can't tell you how often i talk to someone who's just making their life harder for themselves just like i tried this bluff and it should have worked how did he call me with sixes there and it's like you're the one who tells me they never fold just don't do that so okay here we go we go ahead and raise with the nines filling 46 all and the board comes ace jack eight it's on you checker bat that is time go ahead and check here this player checks behind turn is the ace of spades checkerbot time is up go ahead and check here don't turn that and into a bluff like we just said and the river is zoinks it's a nine checkerbat ten seconds five all right that's it so if you did want to bet here how much did you want to bet too remember they never fooled you that's what you're always telling me right how does this make you feel when they fold shouldn't make you feel anything the guy probably totally break the flop that's it that's literally probably like ten seven of hearts or excuse me ten seven of hearts that be a hand that's like six five of hearts okay so but it it's it's almost if these players don't fold two things can't be true at once okay they these players can't simultaneously never full to you and then they also are the players who with 85 000 tournament ships will fold a jack to your slightly larger 5 000 chip pot bet those aren't the same player so what does this guy have here when it goes check check check check most likely he has nothing most likely he has nothing so your bet's not going to get called the question is how often what and he's not going to block don't check you're expecting in a bluff these players are loose passive for reasons so most likely the person has nothing they're not bluffing with it okay so we're going to fire a bet here that is not going to be called the majority of the time that's fine now how do we get the most out of the few times we do get called think about it does this person have an ace you might say that's crazy he would have fired you would have you're the type of person who if you're still listening to the sound of my voice wow i've been talking a while you love to work on your game you are grinding give yourself a pat on the back i legitimately am proud of you i'm not joking about that most people say they want to get better you actually want to get better you want to be a better poker player that question can only be answered with action and today you are acting so give yourself a pat on the back but here's the deal a lot of these players are not like you you know you gotta bet an ace you know you got a bed mix but they i'll tell you how this works i'll tell you because i've worked with a lot of different poker players at different buying levels so this board comes out and they got like the ace 10 that the cold called with or the ace queen this board comes out and they go that's kind of a dangerous board after you check to him i don't want to bet here and get check raised so they check back so the turns and ace and they really like that and they're like oh the flush came in he might have the flush i don't want to bed and have him race so i'm going to check back crazy to you and i right because we're trying to get money from our hands but to them it makes perfect sense because the worst thing that ever happened to them once was they recreational players hate when they make a big hand it loses that feels terrible to them and if we're being honest that that felt awful to us at our first home games remember the first time we had three of a kind and somebody had a flush we couldn't shut up about it we told everybody about it oh my god so i had three of a kind and the guy turns it over and he had a flush so we just got to remember they might still be at that level okay so does he have an ace here yeah some small percentage of the time what's he gonna call with an ace pretty much anything that's not an overbat okay how often does he have a jack here he has a jack here a lot he has a jack here a lot why that board not a lovely board to fire a jack on after we check so he checks for pot control that's what they they don't even know what that word they don't know exactly what that means but that allows them to get to showdowns which is what most recreational players are there to do they want to see flops because you know what when the flop's coming out you're not thinking about your boss shooting you out at work not thinking about the problems you're having with your kids not thinking about your financial difficulties not thinking about your weight you're not thinking about how little sleep you're getting you're not thinking about your 401k you're not thinking about any of that you're free and at the river when everybody gets to show down in your hand there's another moment where you're just weightless you feel nothing and truthfully that's what a lot of gamblers play for that release from the stress and monotony of the day so they try to get to showdown a little too much they might say to you paw patrol paw control paw control they they're not exactly sure what that means what's that jp morgan quote a man does everything for two reasons a good reason and the real reason now so this person sees a jack on that board uh kind of coordinated i want to get the show now okay i'll check tarn little okay the ace paired could i have an ace spade came in all right i'll check it back again is the jack going to fold to anything you put out there no no no of course not no no not when he's got 85 000 chips he's not folding to a 5 000 6 000 chipot so you go bigger here and you got to accept this you can't be afraid to not get value from your hands if that's the optimal bet that's the optimal bet and the more you work through hands like this the more quizzes you do the more you work at your game the more automatic that's going to be villain 48 goes in and raises it's on you and the big blind you got to practice you gotta practice like every day i still practice pretty much every day 15 years into this okay so it's like you were a hitter a major league baseball you probably always have to be doing batting practice always go ahead and call here with the king queen off the board comes five six eight it's on you would you like to check or bet time is up go ahead and check here no 148's been opening a little bit at this table it's been raising quite a bit pre-flop it's uh villain 48 goes ahead and see bets on this board what would you like to do full color raise five seconds okay guys go ahead and raise here to 10.5 and this player calls the turn is the three of diamonds would you like to check about 10 seconds five that's time go ahead and check here and this player checks back the river is the six of diamonds do you like to check or bet 15 seconds ten five that's it give it up handy fires think you're all folding there the real question was did you run a bluff after you got caught now this is one of very few bluffs you can run what's going on here so what happened real quick and if you've seen me explain to check raise before and you didn't see this one coming that means we're not committing to it focus feedback fix it when you're studying focus then you're going to get feedback from me now that then you got to fix it you got to take it into the field with we're interrupting that process somewhere of purposeful practice if we didn't see this one and we've seen a check raise before let's get to it so we're not going to go super accurate on this but what we will show here so you got your king of hearts queen of diamonds and homeboy ears opening a lot we've noticed he's opening a lot all right cool good for him this is money he can do whatever he wants so okay let's just give him this and this is actually a pretty controlled raising range some guys get a little bit more out of line than this but okay this is opening this micro six players low six players if you check out of the big line and you guys are heads up and you just completed pre-flight a lot of them see bet 100 of the time just all the time there's just very little balance and that opens the door for one of very few bluffs you should be doing versus weaker players so this board came what was it five six eight rainbow five of clubs six of hearts and my memory isn't what it wants was eight of spades let's take a look so what you're going to notice here is no mate and is 62.45 percent of the time how do i know that because people like to raise with big cards not middle cards not low cards you'll notice this is what people like to raise with if this doesn't match with this they likely didn't hit if these hands do not match on the flop with these cards it is very likely they missed so what do i mean by that so what happened here if i can figure out how to operate a computer jeez come on man okay so we risked we risked 10 10.5 to win 21.7 so using our super high tech calculator here our bet as a complete bluff needs to work about 48 of the time meaning villain 48 here needs to defend with 52 of their hands they must call a raise with 52 of these hands that's going to be mighty difficult for him to do because let's just see how often he has any pair any draw and i mean a real draw like an open-ended stretcher well he only has that about 34.5 percent of the time he's breaking this board almost two-thirds of the time okay we'll throw in the gut shots all right give him some gut shots he wants to defend with he's still only defending 43 of the time which means he's def he's folding 57 percent of the time and by the way once he calls us we have a lot of equity because what's he going to call with mostly it's going to be his eights sixes and fives do a lot of those have a queen and king or queen in their hand no our outs are pretty clean they probably didn't raise with king five off or queen six suited even if he's a little wild those are those are pretty far out there on this one as you can see i mean it's not impossible it's just not as likely whereas if we check ray's bluff with an ace high it's really likely he has all the ace eights a6's ace five at least the suited combination so we do a bluff now here's the thing the whole reason we do this bluff is we think he opens too many hands he see bets with all of them and he only continues with a pair are an excellent draw great once he gets through that he has an excellent draw or he has a pair he's probably not going to fold so we don't wanna just go cowabunga dude and get rid of all of our money here we had a angle we took it it didn't work and i wanna i know some of you guys have always told me i don't like it when i'm learning from poker trainers and everything in their hands works just perfect everything goes perfect that's not how my games work they're messy people are loud people are a lot annoying there's slots going off in the background and dale just spilled his beer on the felt again oh my god no and you're right no my games are messy too they're always messy so this is a really good lesson as you can see there's a very good logical reason we went for that bluff there the 48 was getting a little live he was getting in there we we took the fight back to him we had a lot of outs on the term most likely we missed all of them he passed the test he wins good luck to him all right continuing all right you got the ace king villain 12 opens it's not a drawing hand guys raise it up villain 12 calls board comes queen 3 2 it's been checked to you here here would you like to check her back it's been checked to you here yep checking check back turn is the jack of diamonds villain 12 checks to you you want to check a bet cinco secondo i think i said that right go ahead and check here the river is the ace of clubs it's been checked to you here you like to check about that is time if you did want to bet here how much did you want to bet time's up we're gonna go ahead and bet 1.5 and this player folds okay guys what's going on here we're putting together a lot of fundamentals again so remember you always have more showdown value in microsix tournaments than you realize and you have a lot less bluff equity than you realize because they don't like default and what that means is the reason that's true for both of those is let's say this guy was goofing off with an acetate off not inconceivable at micro stakes let's say we three bet him and he decides to call with aced off not inconceivable well he wants to get the showdown too so you guys will likely just get to down here a lot of the time now this board is this person after it goes check check on the flop are they going to lead a lot of the queens on the turn most likely it's a pretty good how about the jacks maybe they check some of them but once they check the third time on the river they don't love their hand they probably would have let an ace at this juncture they probably would have better queen on the turn so we're looking at a jack or worse a lot of the time this is a lot of times you know six is seven so just piddly nothing bad pair and once a while it's a paw controlled pair that's confusing but remember our hands easy place right in front of us okay don't go oh my god i hit my hand 5k now there are situations that i tried to show you some of the situations where big bet was appropriate this one though pretty damn likely he doesn't have much anything so we do go for a small bat right here you got the queens and a little bit deeper in micro6 one this was trying to play some tournaments for you guys this is the one i cashed i believe yeah not for a whole heap of chips but anyway villain58 oh excuse me he limps in here 58 limps in my bad sorry misread it i looked at villain 55 and thought that was the big one so you got a limp would you like to do here oh clearly you're going to raise it up you got to get this guy involved as much as possible and you will see a lot of weird limping in micro six events even late because remember these are home game players these are players playing for fun now it's been checked to you here here would you like to check them out you have more showdown value than you ever realize you do not need to turn hands into bluffs if they are weaker than you they will often just check it down and let you see more cards they sure as hell are never folding anything they hit on that board most of what that board hit it's not good for you so he checks again do you on the turn you want to check her bet 10 seconds five that's it check it again the river is the seven of clubs villain 58 checks you here would you like to check or bet time is up go ahead and bat come on guys you know when your hand is good wouldn't he have let an ace on the turn a lot of the time or at least on the river wouldn't he have maybe even fired again fired just once with the king a flush for sure so we go ahead and we get that little value bet in there and he calls so that's one of the other things and it comes right back to let's just go discuss the fundamentals one more time some exploits some plays you can use versus micro stakes players and this will work a lot of the times in your local casino let's go over all of it that was a lot that last hand referred to when they flop pairs they can't fold so bat big now in that hand you saw they can't fold damn near anything he called us probably with very little but you see they can't even fold that so we didn't bet big but we bet something we always got to be trying to get value from these players because they can't fold now let's go over the five exploits real quick that we discussed in this video so you can just you can just look at this write it down and be good to go before you go to your session remember you got to try to apply everything we discuss in these videos you can't learn to swim by reading a book you got to get in there and fight it out yourself and learn so limp jam 2030 x more from the small blood you get to do that a lot in micro stakes events because people just want to gamble they just want to raise they just want to fire and also jam on that note jam 14 to 22 xx more with big hands these players love to gamble give them that opportunity to go bust let them get it in all right i want to go watch netflix with the family great i'll shove my 19x with the queens you can call with your ace 8 suited or your jack 7 diamonds or whatever it is and we'll run it and if you beat me good luck to you sir or ma'am raise weeks small donk leads frequently also i see too many of you guys just call all the time versus these doc leads but you got to understand when micros stakes players do that they're likely bluffs they are testing the water they're seeing what happens they got a really crappy pair that they want to quote find out where they're at with end quote or they just got nothing and they're hoping this will get you to give them some cheap cards or just fold because you're playing too many tables do not give into it now when they flop pairs they can't fold so bet big we discuss that extensively especially on boards where it's very coordinated and it's unlikely anyone's just going to be calling you with a bare high card if they got a pair they're not folding regardless of what you put out there because it's all funny money to them it's a very low buying it's fun so bet big and again guys when loose passive players start bombing the pot get the hell out of there they most likely have it alright guys that's my time for today i hope you enjoyed this one take care i'll see you for the next one of these oh and one more thing to contact me about private coaching please email alex at pokerheadrush.com

[Document(page_content="what's up poker coaching members Evan Jarvis here for pokercoaching.com and today we have a very special video coming to you we are going to be reviewing the 10 000 buy-in scoop 2022 No Limit Hold'em main event final table with all cards up where first place took home 1.14 million US Dollars Booker in the big blind with 10 9 suit it looks like a pretty good spot to defend and take a flop um occasionally some players May opt to three bet all in with this hand due to the fact that you can get some better tens and some better nines to fold and you also have decent Equity when called by hands like Ace King Ace Queen also 15 big blinds are really nice reshuff stack so Derry does go for the reshuff and the jonic snap calls with Ace King flops a flush from a dairy poker there's that good Equity we were talking about flopping two pair turning a boat and even though dejanic river that flush on the end it was no good so Dairy poker finding the double up there to 34 bigs and now we're over to welcome Inferno who has the aces this looks like we we may see a three bet from 2000 not that likely but it is possible given the as the blockers um so this one probably going to make it through vermiculous with an optional defend medium strength Ace uh only issues with it shorter stack and play a little bit of ICM pressure and let's talk about the payouts here because Ninth Place in this tournament is a hundred and two thousand eight hundred nineteen dollars eighth place in this tournament hundred and twenty seven thousand one hundred forty dollars seventh place in the tournament 173 961 second place is two hundred and thirty eight thousand twenty five dollars fifth place 325 682 dollars fourth place is 445 621 third place crazy money here 609 730 second place eight hundred and thirty four thousand two hundred and seventy three dollars and first place takes home A cool one million 141 510 all right we should see an open from remunculus here with Ace eight Suited and I think off of 22 Biggs this is a spot where or 22 effective spot we're welcome Inferno is going to be three betting probably with the intention to be willing to play for all the chips uh Jacks for 22 bigs in a late position battle is totally fine hand to be getting all in you don't necessarily love it um but you can you can definitely be ahead of some of the hands that romiculous would go all in with now facing the three bet although is hand suited um unless he thinks he's bluffing which he does I think we would see a fold but in the instances where he thinks maybe welcome Inferno is trying to push him around and try to use his big stack it's an okay hand to four bet all in with because you have the ace blocker which decreases the likelihood your opponent has an asex calling hand like Ace King Ace Queen an EB Ace Jack suited Ace Ace obviously and when called because you have a suited Ace it's the all you know what they say 30 of the time it works every time he's gonna have 30 when he's up against a pair and up against those dominating Aces slightly less but the suitedness does help so I think it's a spot we're going to see welcome Inferno make the call not love it but make the call get in two to one and he's gonna see if he can hold flush draw for a muculus needs an ace or a heart does not get it on the end and welcome Inferno going to begin that knockout for 22 million chips find open here for dairy Ace Jack and interested to see what welcome Inferno does with sevens he is deep enough to have the odds to set mine he also could just use his stack to put some pressure on Dairy poker here with him being the chip leader Derry poker being one of the stacks that's kind of in the middle of the field and these pay jumps being so big it's a great spot for him to be three betting a lot of hands that he could flat with in close spots um to put pressure against a player who probably doesn't want to be playing big pots with anything but the best hands because the the pay jumps are just so large so welcome does flat call decides to play this hand in position because the same way he could leverage pre-flop with a three bet he can leverage post-flop with floats betting when Chuck two Bluff raises the main thing is he wants to play pots as the big stack against the medium-sized Stacks as much as possible with playable hands so that he can put them in tough positions post-flopping on uncomfortable positions post slop in jail as uh some of my tournament friends would say welcome to science go check check on the Flop this is a board where dairy can be checking a lot of his strong hands um looking to get to a showdown could be checking a queen could be checking an over pair could be checking an indoor pair and could be checking some give UPS as well uh if he's checking those hands though welcome will win just by checking it down and I think it's a spot where he doesn't feel the need to build the pot it's not the best board for him there are the over cards out there and there are a lot of draws out there like Ace Jack has a gut shot King Jack has an open Ender Ace King has a gut shot I think he's just probably not getting too many Folds um from hands that have equity when betting and he's getting a lot of calls from hands that haven't beat Dairy poker here Society wants to just take his hand to show down going into a check call mode seeing if he can get a bluff from his opponent so if you're welcome Inferno what hands are you trying to Bluff out maybe you can get nines to Folds I think that's pretty much it he's gonna go for it we know Dairy poker is going to call here a queen's probably not folding and and eight I don't know how an Eight's in there so I guess the bluff is to get a hand like nines to fold um unfortunately for welcome Inferno that was not what was happening there do you like the BET size though put the most pressure on a queen put the most pressure on a nine if you went for a small bet size that's never working so fair attempt there and dairy poker plays his hand well to get max value with his uh aces up all right he's King ace four suited stack size that could shove and he is going to take that shove spot welcome Inferno that's gonna be a snap call with Ace King uh potentially oh great plot for him opponent drawing dead on the turn well I guess a six would make a chop but um for the most part drawing dead and with that Aziz mancha takes the reshuff with ace4 suited off of 22 big blinds against a loose opener can't blame him for going for it unlucky to run into Ace King and also unlucky to not get there with his 30 shot of winning as he's machar 8th Place finish are going to be taking a 127 140 and 21 cents and our remaining seven players now guaranteed 173 961 dollars now we see welcome Inferno going to be opening a wide range and probably going to continue to do so because remember the deeper we get in the tournament the fewer players we have remaining the larger the pay jumps become for each ladder both in terms of buy-ins and in terms of raw dollar amounts so with welcome Inferno having the big stack and these other players all being kind of in the middle of the pack with one short stack here I think we're going to see him opening a very wide range of hands which includes your king Aid off suits your 7-6 students other suited connectors other asexes things of that nature Centaurus with Ace King here off of 40. uh hand that typically is going to be three bet especially against the loose opener uh oh yeah I was going to say only concern is potentially having to play out of position against one of the players who can take you out of the tournament when you're sitting on you know top three stack and the difference between seventh and second almost seven hundred thousand dollars so it makes sense that sinterest just as Ace King's probably the best hand I'm all in 40 big blinds I'm all in this way he's not going to be forced to play out of position uh his opponent is going to fold a lot of hands and he takes down uh you know a decent pot there 10 ship up sometimes with Ace King that's just what you got to do you got to protect your hand and just ship it in may seem like a lot but think about the alternative of three betting to any other amount getting called and having to play out of position versus the chip leader in a spot where you know you're gonna be missing that flop oh two-thirds of the time all right oh this could be trouble for Mr Numbers welcome Inferno picking up queens on the button and Mr Numbers having a stack size and a hand that can both justify reshoving that 15 to 25 big blind range great spot for reshuffing especially against a loose opener who happens to be opening from the button we'll see if he does go for the three bet all in or if he just decides to defend the big blind both options have Merit but I think the shove is more likely and wow welcome Inferno just picking up all the right hands in all the right spots just needs to fade an ace that's exactly what he does picking up another 28 million chips to be up to 116 blinds uh welcome Inferno and he says love this game it's nice when it works like that he's loving it as is everybody else who's getting these ladders uh our seventh place finisher is going to be taken home 173 961 that's Mr Numbers and everyone remaining guaranteed 238 thousand 25.91 cents this one could be interesting dijonik with queens and acha bogdanov with a very nice hand uh for reshaving King 10 suited and with a very ideal stack size for reshaving 15 bigs he's also the shortest stack on the final table currently so that could justify jamming also it's a hand that plays pretty well post flop uh and he's getting almost three to one on a call only needing 25 Equity to justify continuing so I could see him going either way with this hand he's going with the jam to jonik easy shove here in Ocho has priced himself in I know it may look like oh why is he calling the four bet all in he put in more than half of his chips on the three bet um so he's never folding there so it's going to be Ocho needing a another miracle maybe more diamonds or this time of King it's not looking too good and on that run out he is going to be going home in a sixth place taking home 238 thousand twenty one dollars and 96 cents we're now down to our final five players everyone here guaranteed 326 25 682 on this scoop 2022 10 000 buy-in main event final table all right we're definitely going to see an open ear from welcome Inferno ace four suited the interesting thing will be to see whether or not monsman goes for a three bet with his king queen there is one shorter stack we've seen monsman play the more conservative approach thus far but he recognizes king queen a couple of tier two blockers the king and the queen very worthwhile against players opening very wide now question is what's welcome Inferno going to do he's got that suited Ace he's getting a decent price three to one on a call also has the option to four bet All In and get all the three by blocks to fold and even when he does run into a hand he's got that 30 of the time it works every time um and yeah Mom's with default welcome Inferno doing a great job working the big stack obviously it's easy when you're picking up big hands and your opponents are shoving with worse but also he's he's making the use making the most of the spots where he doesn't have those top tier premium hands and still making great adjustments a spot where we will see a three-bat a committing three bet from welcome Inferno all in and I Dairy poker with sevens here kind of a tough spot he is the shortest stack Seven's off 20 blinds we know welcome Inferno is going wide I wouldn't be surprised if we see a call but it is very close it's about to be very interested to see what the icmiser looks like on this Dairy poker thinking it through again fifth place 325 thousand dollars fourth place 445 000 big pay jump here if Dairy poker calls and wins though they'll go from being the short stack to being in third place which is greatly increasing their equity in the tournaments Dairy poker does decide to fold it's always a really tough spot when you have those medium pairs there your opponent may be shoving somewhere's Paris but isn't necessarily doing all them and if even if Malcolm Inferno is doing all the pairs about half the time he has worse pairs Deuces threes fours five sixes and then even more the time he has better pairs eights nines tens Jacks Queens Kings Aces so seven better pairs versus five worst pairs then we're flipping against most of the rest of the range the hands that we do have dominated would be those pseudidases Ace two suited Ace three sudodays four Studios five suited but they don't comprise all that much of the range when you really think about the combinations all right here with Queen 10 I think we'd see Dairy poker defend here I think just flatting makes the most sense take a flop uh often a good play to make with these Broadways see if you can flop top pair or some kind of strong draw over cards in a gut shot or an open Ender before committing any more chips and on boards like this where really just whiff completely other than a couple of back doors just an easy fold when faced with a bet welcome Inferno going for a Min bet here no reason to bet anymore he's trying to invite his opponent to continue with as wide a range as possible he wants his opponent to get in there with a pair of fours pair of twos um you know a five six maybe even a back door draw like this one but he's not going to quite get that action Dairy poker good laid out and here we are going to see some fireworks it's monsman picking up pocket tens the dying pieces Dairy poker picking up queens the ladies this money is going to be going in the middle almost certainly Dairy poker will make it committing three bet whether it's eight blinds and then calling off the rest or just the full 16 right here and I don't see how monsman is gonna get away from pocket tens here for 16 big blinds because in this case when we think about the better Pairs and the worst pairs right Jacks Queens Kings Aces four better pairs but worst pairs nines eights sevens sixes are going in here fives are probably going in here and if you add any more you got a lot of worse hints that are going into so I think there yeah monsman's hand way too strong you snap calls it's queens versus tens bondsman's gonna need a 10 on the river to get back in this does not get it unfortunate for him very unlucky Dairy poker get in the double queens versus tens and our monsmen on the ropes here and we'll see welcome Inferno probably just shove here for six blinds and monsman snap call with Jack three suited I'm uh I'm a little bit surprised by that I guess he expects welcome Inferno is maybe going to be shoving any two and uh therefore versus that he feels like he has enough equity to justify calling Let's uh let's just go back check it out it all just happened so fast okay so we're looking at four million to win a pot of 9 million all right so we have four million into nine right four four no four four and four point five so four to eight point five and he's calling 3.3 it's 3.3 8.5 needs 38 equity and we could just use the equilab and see which act 3 suited against what range do we need it to be to have that equity 25 percent not quite uh 40 should be there no not quite fifty percent fifty percent is going to be right on the line so if uh welcome Inferno is shoving any suited face card pretty much any Ace uh any pair two cards above an eight and the suited connectors the Jacks free suited is good enough to call seems very close but I think it's reasonable to think that welcome Inferno shoving this wide if not even wider uh just put the pressure on so the other thing is monsman is really short here and if he doesn't take this spot and the blinds go through he's going to be down to five big blinds and it's most likely he's gonna go out next they're also playing short-handed where the blinds are being hidden more often so in a close body as to maybe take close to a flip or close to break even in terms of pot odds makes sense to try to get back in the game and give himself a chance to actually Ladder Up This tournament fortunately for him he spikes that pair of Threes on the river he could not hit a jack as that was going to give welcome Inferno a straight and all right he's back in the game with 13 big blinds and the shorter you are the more valuable the overlay of the small blind big blind and ante are in terms of um significance to your stack right because that's some some added overlay to the pot and the fewer chips you have the more meaningful it is you know if you're all in for five blinds and there's two and a half extra in the middle or even two in the middle that's a lot more percentage-wise than if you have 20 big blinds and there's two in the middle now I understand you will modsman take the reshuff here with Ace eight yes he does love it recognize welcome inferno's going very wide recognizing an ace likely the best hand in this four-handed situation and he's increased his stack back up to 17 blinds three hands ago he had five now he's up to 17. see if to jonik wants to open up Ace rag I think if the chip Stacks were reversed we'd see dijonik open up with Ace five there but because the big Stacks in the big blind and he's shown a willingness to use that big stack of propensity to put pressure back to jonik correctly adjusting and not opening the weaker hands in his uh typical opening range welcome Inferno not going as wide as seven Deuce there and we could see an interesting one here Dairy poker making the adjustment not opening King 9 suited we saw earlier he did open that and got three bet this time he does not Cinder us with an open this will be a three bet from welcome Inferno question is what sizing I think with their beans larger Stacks behind of 50 blinds it's going to be a non-all in three bet but instead he goes for an all this is an interesting spot Citrus gonna have the best hand here very frequently and I think if welcome Inferno had done a normal three bet since Ross would four bet all in with Ace Queen having some fold equity and the chance to increase his chip stack very significantly to the tune of almost 10 blinds now being put all in uh he doesn't have any fold Equity but he does have the best hand a lot so the big consideration is the paid jumps and the fact there's one shorter stack I'm very curious to see uh what will be here and we'll take a look at the icmizer numbers as well sinterest does make the fold and that shows the power of using the big stack and uh getting aggressive with those blockers that you know have 30 Equity even when called getting a dominating hand to call because interest just doesn't want to call us chips off so nice play there from welcome Inferno three betting all in for max pressure the the risk is of getting ambushed by dijonik who has 50 blinds but also that being said because he's in second place facing the big stack he's going to call with a very very very narrow range um which yeah a very very narrow range which is being blocked partially by welcome Inferno having that Ace decreasing the chance of Ace King and Ace Ace all right you see a spot here Dairy poker with sevens says let's take a flop let's play it three-way uh to jonik having a better hand than welcome Inferno pre-flop but not wanting to build a pot out of position and just find himself in some sticky situations post flop no piece for anyone on this board Dairy poker having the best of it with the Ender pear sevens welcome Inferno not wanting to bet into two players more players who see the Flop more likely someone has a piece of it the less likely your C bet is going to be to work and a dairy poker having the best of it not sure if they can bet for protection though they do have the best hand but welcome Inferno definitely checks back some hands that are better than sevens on this board so Dairy poker decides to bet but to bet very small it's kind of a block but I'm just looking to fold out those hands that have some equity that are live but not looking to build a big pot against a potential eight potential knives potential tents welcome Inferno calls for that price and improves to the best hand on the river question is will Dairy poker go for another blocker bet here trying to get as cheap of a showdown as possible against both 8 X's maybe Ace highs or will he check because 910 has improved to a better pair Queen 10 10 7 the gut shots have all improved to straights and um yeah he can check to potentially induce a bluff from hearts or he may just be checking to check fold welcome Inferno definitely with a strong enough hand to Value about the question is what size does he want to make it he's targeting a pair of eights or a hand like Dairy poker hands small pair he goes for value does not get called but a nice pot nonetheless for welcome Inferno taking it down there and we will see a little bit of action here to Johnny picking up A7 suited definitely a strong enough hand to be opening and welcome Inferno picking up a big hand again Jack's in the small blind I've seen him play quite aggressively will be interesting to see how did yonic reacts to a three bet oh but Dairy poker decides to go for the three bet with uh a tier two Blocker of the queen and tier three Blocker of a jack and um now welcome Inferno just got that four bat spot uh gonna be a full fold nice chip up there for welcome Inferno Dairy poker may be saving to jonik from some paint we'll never know because we didn't get to see the flop all right Dairy poker picking up A7 hearts definitely going to be opening here and if welcome Inferno had not woken up with Jax there if Dairy poker did not get ambushed on that previous hand uh this Reba with Queen Jack probably would have worked probably would have gone through so fine adjustment there recognizing to jonik with the medium-sized stack has shown a propensity to open a little bit looser than average and a dairy poker adjusting to that by going for a light three bet now here flopping top pair may go for a very small bet something to the tune of men or may check to give his opponent a chance to improve to a second best pair all right now with that blinds are going to be going up to 350 700 000 which is going to shallow out the stacks just a little bit let's do a little update our short stack monsman 15 big blinds it's probably going to be a little less short after this hand because he's got a great reshuff all in spot against our loose opener welcome Inferno who's our chip leader currently sitting on 131 big blinds our fourth place player Derry poker sitting on 21 bigs third place centauros with 24 and second place stack to Johnny still on 39 big blinds so we've got some reshuff Stacks we've got a medium stack and we have a very large stack who has over half the chips in play with that Dynamic and these pay jumps expect to see welcome Inferno opening a lot of pots three bedding a bunch for bedding a bunch and just applying a ton of pressure to his opponents he will not be uh looking for that fold button any more often than is absolutely necessary Terry poker opening Ace six Suited me with the Ace in the big blind getting a decent price definitely a Troublesome hand makes the defend gonna play cautiously flopping bottom pair it's a board that has quite a lot of draw potential so Dairy firing a small bed here the monsman's got to continue for at least one bottom pair probably can't continue versus a second Barrel but that being said I don't think it's very likely Dairy poker is going to fire a second Barrel here with A6 suited on this board straight draws have improved to either a pair or a straight flush draws still willing to continue in this case flush draws have improved so the one hand he could get to fold is a pair of fives but a pair of eights going over a pair of jacks going nowhere a pair of 10 is going nowhere everything better going nowhere and dairy poker just having little to no equity with E6 of hearts on a board with nothing but the other suits it's probably just going to be given up with the handle now on this River could go for a bluff yeah flush gets there straight gets there so now on this River he could get a pair of eights to fold maybe you can get a pair of tens to fold so nice job there dairy poker recognizing that on most rivers it would be a give up but on that perfect River where he can get a lot of one pair of hands to fold that are beating his A6 nice spot to go for a chunky Bluff take it down great play there from dairy poker all right we'll see an open here from welcome Inferno with King 3 suited for sure and off of 14 blinds this is another easy reshuff for monsman he's getting a lot of these optimal spots that you want when you're sitting on that 12 to 25 big blind stack which is a loose opener opening from late position when you have a medium to strong strength hand that being those pocket pairs the bigger the better and those asexes the bigger the better and of course your king queen suited your king queens and your suited Broadways as well but welcome Inferno not going to be slowing down we'll see another open Dairy poker very playable hand here with king queen question is how to play it there are two shorter Stacks but with how wide welcome inferno's going I wouldn't be surprised if we just see this one going all in I guess he could conceivably flat um and commit more chips when he improves his hands we can keep in those dominated King x's and queen axes oh he does decide to fold actually probably due to the fact that these two stacks are both shorter and the fact that welcome Inferno is opening from first position or maybe it was because welcome Inferno has just been running so hot with all ends and every time someone re-jams welcome just seems to have it and dairy poker didn't want to be the next one to uh Fall by the wayside either way dirty poker folding what was technically the second best hand but what certainly would have been a strong enough uh and to to make a play with and while Queen Inferno would have been folding that he's four suited for that many big blinds did johnik opening A7 Suited welcome to Inferno getting a great price but on a pretty weak hand suited six High three gapper says let's take a flop it's bottom pair for welcome Inferno top pair for the jonic backdoor diamonds for the both of them certainly a strong enough hand for dijonik to bet here he wants to get protection from over card hands he wants to charge the draws he wants to charge the worst Pairs and he wants to get value from the worst pairs I do Sephora are going to call all sevens or Worse sevens and Johnny probably gonna be wanting to just go for three streets with this hand if he gets a good run out goes for 1.4 the small bat size I think a large bat size is also reasonable here to get more protection and welcome Inferno doing a check raise Bluff your reason he's making this play is twofold first he thinks to jonik is betting with pretty much his entire range there are going to be a lot of hands that to Johnny has just missed with which are the over card type hands things of that nature second is if he is up against a pair that is not top pair top kicker an even top pair top kicker maybe we'll just call but a lot of one pair hands are just going to call here uh which means welcome Inferno is effectively semi-bluffing with the five outer so on the occasions where dijonik is just betting the parts of his range that have missed uh welcoming friends looking to take the pot down right now risking 3.5 to win 5 million nice odds and even when he is up against a pair he's semi-bluffing with the five outer which will improve by the river a little bit over 20 of the time with the back door straight draws and backdoor flush draws working for him as well so this is a play you can make on dry boards where you think your opponent's going to be betting a lot of Misses now the question is well did johnik re-raise here for protection or will he call we certainly know he's not folding by calling he keeps in the worst Hands by shoving yeah I think I think if he shoves even a seven is going to be really considering things because it is a significant amount of chips so I think he's kind of stuck just calling and allowing welcome Inferno to to keep betting we said it's probably he's probably looking for three streets and one face with that check race he got two of the streets right there now welcome Inferno checks the turn I think it's a spot to jonik probably wants to bet uh not too many of the two pair hands are checking and when welcome Inferno has one of these One Pair of Hands he still has a 10 chance to improve on the river and I think to jonik wants to bet for to charge those hands but he decides he's going to check uh wanting to get to The Showdown and now he will probably be snapping off any bet from welcome Inferno let's not make a bat and with the two over cards coming off to johnik not wanting to go for value on the river reason probably being he's second place he's up against first place these other Stacks are very short starting to get very short and very shallow and he just doesn't want to take on any extra variants all right Dairy poker with Ace Jack suited cintras with Queens will be interesting to see what we get here probably a non-all in three bet since it's off of 21 blinds that would be interesting to see what Dairy poker does tough spot tough spot for like a smaller sizing with the ace Jack being suited but if you think about centauros's range for going all in here there aren't a lot of worse Aces these tents East nines and there aren't a lot of worse Jacks we're probably not seeing a lot of King Jacks who did Queen Jackson going all in so unless it's interesting making the play with those weak suited Aces there aren't a lot of worse hands that cintras is going to have here and even those are balanced out you know ace2 suited ace3 suited ace four suited is already balanced out by one combo of Ace King off suit and if you add the suited in there too all your suited Ace is Ace two days three suited ace four suited Ace five suited for four combos each of 16 is going to be balanced out by one combo of Ace King which is 16 so even if he has a few of those weaker aces in the range it's still balanced out by all the much better ranges that dominate us back so overall Central is going to be dominating Ace Jack suited way more than he is dominated by it so it's actually an easy fold for dairy poker easy open and then an easy fold when faced with the three bat let's see if welcome Inferno going this wide he is mons man it's it's the same spot he's had the whole time King 10 suited strong enough hand uh suited Broadway it's one of the hands we mentioned earlier off of 17 bigs he's going to commit make the committing three bet and uh welcome Inferno just got another fold here just another raised fold and if it firsts you raise and fold then raise the pot again come on stop doing this they will ban us for chip dump I love one on these final tables these guys are still just like happily chatting away it's one of the fun things about watching the um the big buy and final tables where they have the big prize pools even though these guys are playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars they're still able to be pretty chatty and pretty fun and I think it's partially because they've already locked up so much money everyone here is guaranteed 300 000 yes they're playing for another 800 on top to get to that Millie 1.1 Milli um but uh you know a lot a lot of pressure is taken off when you've locked up 300K plus 30 buy-ins so I welcome Inferno defending another suited hand flopping bottom pair we'll probably see them continue this time with the check call if the board had been I Know Jack 7-2 we may have seen him work in that semi-bluff check raise on a dry board again but on the ace high board which really favors monsman's range and mosman has the range Advantage I think while conferno decided he shouldn't make that play and then just folds to the turn bet and uh oh bondsman find an unlucky spot with the tens once again since you're asked with Kings welcome Inferno going to be opening with fours monsman with the three bet here question is will you go none All In he has quite a few more chips than he did before she goes for the not all in centauros is going to be four betting here with Kings it's a spot where you may be a little tempted to get fancy and just flat call issues with that are you're making your hand look very strong to begin with so your opponents know they're up against a strong hand and what may play cautiously post flop try to see more cards for free the other thing is if he just calls here he invites welcome Inferno into the pot closing the action now he's up against two players instead of one and um there's he's got a 50 ship up if he takes it down right now and most of the hands that he wants to get it all in with against bondsman are still going to be calling here Ace kings queens jacks be interesting to see if monsman can get away from tens here I feel like it's kind of tough but uh when cintras is cold forbidding all in from the big blind versus Under the Gun open and under the gun plus one three bet he does need to have a very strong hand and um I just I don't know if you know pocket nines is in this range or pocket eights is in this range and therefore if it's only Jax plus an Ace King maybe monsman does get away from it and indeed he does so welcome Inferno saving monsman there because if it had been a single raised pot for monsman and then a three bet from centross all in I don't know how monsman gets away from it it's only because it went raise three bet and then cold four bet that monsman was able to lay it down and it's always a really good question to ask um when you're facing a reshuff three bet four bet whatever um what's the what's the worst hand that my opponent would do this with and am I beating that hand and how many worse hands are there that he's doing this with that I'm dominating versus how many better hands are there that he's doing this with that dominate me that's kind of how you can do some simpler math uh in game at the table to make your decision because you know we don't have uh equilabs calculators uh built into our brains it's jonik with fives we saw a full 10 9 suited previous hand suggesting the fact that the big stack was in the big blind resub Stacks in position and that he wasn't that deep at 40. but opening five so I think we'll see a three bet from welcome Inferno tier one blocker with the Ace Plus a tier three blocker with a 10. and I don't think to Johnny can continue here with pocket fives should just be a raise fold okay interesting spot here Dairy poker easy open with Ace 10. interesting to see if cintras will make the three bet here with Ace 9 suited Tier 1 blocker suited hand with a strong kicker against a player who is doing some raised folding so definitely has hands they can raise volume from first position sinterest does find that three bet this is going to knock monsman sixes out um I think it's probably gonna win the pod Dairy poker would have to expect Centris is three vet bluffing enough to justify four betting all in here and we just we haven't seen centauros do really anything out of line yet on this final table I think Dairy poker probably is going to fold here that being said maybe these guys have a dynamic from earlier in the tournament or from previous tournaments they do have tons and tons of games played Dairy poker with 36 000 tournaments plates in trash blocks from search probably has even more they definitely have a lot of dynamic from previous games but Terry poker does find the fold there I wouldn't be surprised if welcome Inferno three bets here again tier 2 blocker with the king plus a tier three blocker with the 10. decent blocker score on this hand and just once again great ship Stacks to be leveraging into now to jonik a hand that flops well with position king queen Suited but again with the two shorter Stacks pretty tough it's probably a little fed up with three bedding maybe once before bed all in does find the four bed all in because he doesn't want to have to hit the Flop post flop to improve and with him having the king and queen he's got blockers to Ace King Ace Queen kings and queens a lot of hands are going to be calling have you just seen welcome Inferno is doing tons of three betting so makes sense to jonic just says I think you're three betting way too wide I have a hand that is possible to be best and even if it's not it's a hand that's going to have a lot of equity so I'm all in and the thing is if he jams and gets called but wins the all in suddenly he's the chip leader and welcome Inferno is in second so all the three betting that welcome what Inferno wasn't doing to apply pressure to Janik now the rules are reversed and to John it gets to do that versus him plus he has positioned a little more often on him so always scary uh when you're second place pushing all the chips in against first place especially when the pay jumps are so significant but it's uh one of the ways to ensure that uh the chip leader has to slow down and uh doesn't slowly chip you down into being in the same stack size as everyone else so Props to dijonik for playing back there taking a stand and not finding the right time for it speaking of the right time right River coming for dijonic River in a straight Broadways through 10 monsman rivering two pair this pot's not going to get crazy big but uh dijonik definitely going to take it down probably go for a smaller sizing here two and a half three three and a half million something that two pair can possibly call yeah there it is three and a half million Mon's been knowing his hands no good easy fold uh now this could spell disaster for dairy poker dijonik premium hand jacks on the button Dairy poker a really good hand in a really good stack size for shoving all in this is kind of an ideal situation for dairy poker to be getting all in uh pocket sevens small blind versus button 20 big blinds um yeah this is just very likely going all in and it's going to be a snap call for dijonik there's really no other way that Dairy poker can play the hand this is just really unlucky because if you've seen all the hands to jonik's opening you think about how wide he's opening there's so many hands he's going to be opening and folding so as dairy poker just need to get lucky here does not and dairy poke are going to be our fifth place finisher there taking home 325 682 dollars 84 cents those spots really just taking the good odds to defend your big blind pre-flop and then um taking the good odds that are offered on the flop when you have two chances to improve and speaking of improvement monsman limping in flop in a flush drawn to jonik checking his option flopping a gut shot may see a bet from tajonik to get the random Airy hands to fold but says let's take a free turn card I'll wait for my opponent to check twice before I believe he has nothing and uh unfortunately for him his turn second pair is not the best hand mom's been turning the queen High flush betting for value to jonik very likely going to call at least one here that River not the best Forum um he now beats none of the pairs King x7x are all better and 3DX makes trips so he's beating missed straight draws and missed flush draws I don't know if that's going to be enough to justify calling and uh for an over bet effectively All In feel like to John I'm probably going to find the fold but we'll see we'll see monsman hoping his opponent has either a king or a three going for a size like that can't fault him also probably figures that a seven and a six aren't going to call any bet size anyway so he might as well just Target the strongest parts of his opponent's range to Johnny picking up fives here hasn't opened the question is what size will he go with on the button here goes for men welcome Inferno Big Lick in the big blind get four to one says let's see three flops a gut shot well the jonak flopping an Ender pair here does have the best of it may go for a small bet for protection may also just check it back try to get to The Showdown that's what he's doing welcome Inferno had a hand that could conceivably check raise on the flop it's a similar spot to earlier on the 7-4 deuce board where he's got some Equity with the gut shot and it's also a board where his opponent is going to miss a lot I bet now he turns the best hand but because it's a lower part of the range being third pair with flush and straight draws possible he's going with that smaller bet size wants to take the betting lead wants to be able to get called by worse doesn't want to narrow his opponent's range too much to only being better hands which is what might happen if you went with a large bet size on this River dijonik has the best fit with the straight but if welcome Inferno followed it up with another bet here on the fourth Spade coming through very good chance to jonik would lay that hand down all right monsman could be re-shubving all in here could be taking a flop uh if it was Inferno snapshove dijonic opening pretty wide but not quite as wide as well quinferno also it's coming from under the gun also Mon's been having a few more big blinds here with 18 getting closer to centauros's stock so playing a bit more treading a bit more cautiously here just calling pre-flop and on this board then we gotten two streets of value maybe three Johnny betting small on the flop now if he bets larger on the turn he's looking to get value from a queen but think about it a queen is probably only calling two bets here rather than three so it makes sense to check back see a cheap see a cheap River and um not build the pot against the better Aces because there are more better aces in monsman's range than worse Aces and a queen's only calling two bets anyway so it makes sense for the John to play PAW control he river is a chop now we'll see if monsman goes for a large bet here he does and that's choppot he's the open here for welcoming Inferno King eight Suited pentatonic King 4 does have a tier two blocker um but not the best stack size for three betting being so deep so he's just gonna call with the King High both players flop and top pair Inferno could go either way here you can definitely bet for Value a lot of possible draws here straight draws flush draws worst pairs that can call sevens and fives he's got a strong enough kicker that he can get called by worst kings so he's gonna bet high frequency low sizing and Queen of Clubs bringing even more draws possible so that's one reason to lean towards betting if you're welcome Inferno you want to charge those draws you don't mind folding out a five and a seven if we do bet here probably going to be checking back the river because the kings that are continuing are starting to be more better Kings rather than worse Kings and welcome Inferno going for the really large sizing that is because of all the draws possible now he wants to get a lot more protection against the front door flush draw the back door flush draw the possible but unlikely open-ended straight draw and he wins this pot all right jonak with a playable hand Queen nine it folded Centaurus with a playable hand A7 and a welcome Inferno with a defendable hand King Ain't decides not to play and Centaurus straight plane is strong a pre-flop poker All In I believe I have the best hand welcome Inferno says no thanks see if he makes the same play here with Ace King on 22. I'm just gonna see an open shove or is this a strong enough hand that he's willing to invite a little bit of action give his opponents a chance to reshuff with Ace Queen Ace Jack king queen suited Ace 10 where you can call them dominating that's what he does and we may see some fireworks here monsman oh okay mom's been 18 bigs on the button into jonic with sevens that could be a flip but with welcome Inferno opening it's gonna be a shove for monsman off 18 and I don't think dejanik really needs to call with sevens um again there are some worst pairs that monsman's doing this with sixes fives maybe he's fours and threes and twos but there are also all the better pairs that monsman's doing this with eights nines tens Jacks Queens maybe Kings and Aces do some kind of a slow play and then they're all the hands that are flipping so jonnic not really crushing monsman's range there it's going to make the fold all right to Johnny Ace Queen easy open likely be getting it through unless uh welcome Inferno decides to get frisky with the student gapper we have seen welcome Inferno being willing to do some light three bets but typically he's doing that when he has blockers when he has high card hands which decreases the chances that his opponent has a handheld continue with we haven't seen him reach all the way down to the suited Gap or portion of the range which is starting to get pretty splashy and with the Johny showing a willingness to play back that's also a reason maybe welcome isn't going to take all the spots speaking of spots on bondsman with another super easy rejam here 20 big blinds Ace 10 versus that loose button open and uh stars stars keeping an eye out the chip dumping continues from Malcolm Inferno to monsman welcome loses one wins one loses one wins two and he's still finding his way to uh chip up throughout this process because it's hard to wake up with a hand bondsman just happens to be getting dealt the right cards at the right time just another version of getting lucky all right neither player getting lucky on this flop monsman with the best of it just stays High pretty dry board though Queen eight two not a lot of draws possible which means fewer hands that welcome Inferno can continue with or semi Bluff with takes down with a c-bat welcome Inferno nice playable hand here with the King seven Suited have seen him taking the aggressive option mostly thus far with a lot of raising he's just gonna go for an all-in shove making it very tough for monsmen to continue Johnny picking up Ace King suited for 20 bigs uh we could see a shove we could see a raise Centaurus I don't know if this Ace is strong enough for him to be going all in he seems to know his reshuffing ranges and his open shoving ranges pretty well so I guess we will find out just a minute what Centaurus wants to do the ace is good the three is pretty awful though and the stack size is pretty delicate on 20 bigs he does take the shove to Sonic snap calls Ace King suited oh Centaurus thinks the three it's gonna be a queen or a king needed for the Johnny does not get it and sin Taurus gets lucky at the right time now doubling up to 40 big blinds so things are interesting now dijonic and Centaurus tied for second with 40 bigs welcome Inferno in first place with a hundred monsmo 25. all right some action here mom's been picking up sevens that's going to be an open from what we've seen from Malcolm Inferno I expect that he's going to be three betting here putting bondsman All In and oh it's gonna be an awkward spot for sevens but he is the shortest stack tough though 20 bigs definitely playable stack short of Stack oh man sticky situation for monsman here big pay jumps does make the call it's a flip he needs to hold here no Ace no Jack not going to be the run out Bond's been wanted but uh strong call there he's going to be our fourth place finisher taking him 445 621.86 the chip dumping talks are off the tables and uh just a few minutes ago while conferno was saying that monsman had found his best friend on the final table turns out that was probably not the case man I'm excited we got some three-handed play here a lot of a lot of play left in these Stacks you know almost 40 effective all around and uh we're playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars between some very experienced players against interest blocked from search but one of the ogs of pokerstar has been around forever to jonik with uh 10 000 games played smaller average stake of only 60 but uh large winnings seven figures and welcome Inferno kind of our mystery man who only had 51 games average stake of 2 000 but clearly no fear playing high stakes poker here I mean with an average blind of 2000 clearly the man capable and comfortable and we've seen him really playing in a fashion that would uh reflect that bringing out an overbed here on the turn probably targeting exactly this kind of hand definitely getting three to four trying to put pressure on a king here even a weak Ace it's gonna be feeling a little uncomfortable Centaurus makes the call is welcome Inferno going to go for the Kamikaze triple barrel with nine High had no draw on the Flop did not improve to any draw on the turn just had absolutely nothing but maybe a range Advantage button versus big blind will he go for it here what puts into us in a very tough spot I I do not think that sinterest could call here and wow welcome Inferno triple barreling with six nine suited nine High absolutely nothing putting centaurs to the test wow what a play just using the range advantage awkward spot for sinterest you beat the Mist backdoor flush draws um you just don't be very much though and a great play by welcome Inferno right when we were talking about how he was not afraid to do battle seems very comfortable playing for these high stakes shows us exactly why he's able to do that triple barely with nine High knowing he has a range Advantage knowing his opponent is kind of capped in his range and knowing that his opponent is very much interested in this 230 thousand dollar pay jump probably not wanting a hero call off with the worst hand so wow great play there for welcome Inferno don't try that one at Home Folks uh welcome Inferno with threes here if it was 20 effective I think we just see a shove for 40 effective not sure since her ass with Queens strong enough hand to do a non all in three bet based on what we've seen before it may just be a jam do not expect him to just call though yep he's going to go for the non all in three but I like it giving his opponent room to 4 bet All In but since he hasn't done a ton of light three betting I don't think welcome Inferno is going to fall for it and he does not finding the easy fold with threes the downside to having built a tighter image is you are typically going to get less action on your big hands when you actually get them the benefits to building a looser image is that you are typically going to get more action on your hands when you pick them up which is kind of what we saw help happen to welcome Inferno where people were just willing to slam it on them with the the weaker suited Aces and other hands that just happen to be in really bad shape because I assume the chip leader is going bonkers and speaking of Bonkers he's going to be three betting with the tier two blocker King four not really wanting to play uh this hand out of position being an off suit and now to jonik pressures back on you my man you've got the ace blocker you know the opponent three bets really wide but do you want a four bet all in with 40 bigs with your Ace suited when there's this potential pay jump and play and a shorter stack the answer is yes dejanic knows exactly what's going on here he knows that welcome is going to be full of it at a very high frequency of the time and just says A6 suited my hand is too strong man I'm all in give me that 20 ship up that's what he does kudos to dijonik for having no fear he hasn't had a battle with Inferno all the time but he has been willing to put in those four bets uh when he thought welcome Inferno was full of it with those three bets and uh just propsed him really well played really good adjustments of recognizing what welcome Inferno is doing trying to leverage the pay structure trying to leverage ICM and just being willing to uh go for it despite that despite the fact he's in second place and there's a shorter stack in place that's exactly why welcome Inferno is making the plays he's making really good example of the importance of being willing to be Fearless when you know your opponent's strategy all right nice turn here for welcome Inferno turning two pair Centaurus with the gut shot if he's betting it's to put pressure on an eight a four he does got the gut shot his back up kind of curious to see what welcome Inferno does here a lot of draws possible backdoor Spade draws possible uh straight draw as possible pair and straight draws possible so a lot of hands that while quinferno may want protection with and also it may be a spot where a strong King would call the All In so I wouldn't be surprised if we see a check shop here just with how draw heavy the board is but if he wants to keep his opponent semi Bluffs in and give him a chance to keep barreling at it maybe he wants to represent he has a hand like eight seven or something maybe he just calls so that he can go check on the river and give sinterest the opportunity to um three Barrel him off his hand which I think it's pretty unlikely to get folded so cinderos could wrap the back door flush draw does not do so just checks it back and uh welcome Inferno picking up another pot there and this could be a spot if Inferno gets lucky Centaurus picking up a TENS if he just goes for a Min raise it's a good spot for Inferno to put him to the test if he goes for a shove for 13 not sure if uh welcome Inferno will call off with ace4 suited here because he's he doesn't need to be in a rush to busts and tour us out of the tournament but first is the Min Rays he's certainly going to go for the reshuff there's some Hanson Tauruses raised folding and even when he runs up against it 30 of the time it works every time uh no 10 no King and Centaurus gonna be our third place finisher maybe a little bit unlucky losing that 70 30 there but we did see him get lucky earlier winning a 25-75 against Deja with the ace three versus Ace King so that's in Taurus gonna be our third place finish taking him 609 730 dollars and eight cents I'm going to raise from the jonak King nine welcome Inferno definitely a defendable hand here with Jack 10 and we will see some chips going in the middle here that's without a doubt it's mid pairing an open-ended straight draw for welcome Inferno it's bottom pair and a gut shot and an overcard for dijonik the trade notes here to John x two pair would give Inferno the straight inferno's two pair would give dejanic the straight and both players make the other two pair on the turn that does not give either a straight it is queens and tens for Inferno going for the value bet it is queens and nines for dijonik who's not going to be laying it down for a single bet here May fold for the second bet the reason he may call the second bet if the river's a brick though is that uh Jack X misses Hearts Miss diamonds Miss so there are a lot of semi-bluffs that welcome Inferno could have been leading with on the turn that have missed on the river 7-8 does get there but they're a lot more of the other two flush draws than there are seven eights so I wouldn't be surprised if tajonik decides to make a hero call here on the end and depend on the sizing welcome Inferno going for two thirds pot over to dejanic with the worst of it but uh some decent Showdown value with the nine does make the call because of all the missed draws and unfortunately for him while quinferno shows the goods extending his chip lead to about six to one here it's 154 bigs for welcome Inferno 26 bigs for dijonik and we will probably see some action here Ace 10 versus Ace Queen for 25 blinds both pretty strong hand set up especially on these shallow stacks if dejanic raises here maybe a spot welcome inferno's going for a limp shove if dejanic just shoves I think welcome Inferno probably gonna make the call here with Ace 10 for 25 blinds see I'm shoving will it just BLM call yeah it does go for the limb shop snap call for dejanic he's a 75 25 3-1 favorite here just needs to fade a 10.

[Document(page_content="mostly what we're going to be working on is understanding pre-flop Theory it's going to be incredibly difficult to look up difficult and inefficient to look up pre-flop ranges all the time uh while you're playing well first of all it's against TOS now to do that while you're playing I think or I'm not even really sure anymore but looking at prefab charts all the time and trying to study by memorizing the grids is very difficult so I think a much better way to do it is to get a deeper understanding of why we're you know why we're three betting from what positions what size is what type of hands more like a general base understanding of you know why are we three betting uh what's the point and how we're balancing value in Bluffs and and general structural uh understanding of of three bedding so we're going to work on that and then a little bit of post Lop I'll give you guys some really nice shortcuts for post swap uh that make a lot of money so all right so I took a bunch of notes I've spent like 10 hours today uh looking at all these uh pre-flop spots for three betting and I took a bunch of notes to sum everything up so you guys can get a quick understanding of what's going on so for in position three bets this is when you know under the gun or middle position opens and um we are in position to that player um I took notes on different stack sizes we have 100 big blinds we have 60 big blinds and 30 big blinds the sizing that we're going to be using most of the time for 100 big blinds is 3.5 x and as the stack size gets smaller we're going with smaller sizings some guys even are using 2.6 x uh but these are the study these are the sizings that I've been studying so we're just going to look at what do we do uh what what are our range what does our range look like with these sizes so at 100 big blinds when we 3.5x in position with three bet we're using roughly 45 value 55 Bluffs from all positions uh versus utg open the EP early position three bets are linear and the lp3 bets are polar so what does this mean so if we are if under the gun opens and we are in the Under the Gun we are under the gun one our three bets um will be the top X percentage of range there's no split we don't uh the Bluffs that we're using are just hands that are slightly worse than our value pane so a hand like Ace Coin off or Ace Queen suited would be considered a bluff here and you're not through betting a lot now why are we using this linear sizing it's not a plus EV for this player that's under the gun one player to be flatting a lot and that is because there are so many players left to act that uh you know hands like Ace Coin suited are going to lose value when flattened when you play them as a flat because other players can come in uh behind for a very cheap price and uh at the top of our value range is not playing well multi-way so this type of range when when an EP range opens and we three vet uh our the top 10 of our hands just really like the three bet uh and then we're folding everything else and then if we look at the three bets from light position it's polar so we're three betting the best hands and then we're also three betting uh some Bluffs that are significantly worse than our flatting range and this is because Flats can be so profitable for a late position player versus an early position razor hands like Jack 10 suited on the button hands like king queen off on the button six seven suited on the button all of these hands are printing uh by by just calling so they those types of hands want to do that and then we also want to have three bed Bluffs you know generally what you're going to see here is that when you're three betting you're almost always going to have half value half Bluffs and um you know that type of balance is very difficult to play against and maximizes the EV for the three better so 60 big blinds we're going to be sizing down 3x sizing we're still going to keep maintain the same ratio of value to Bluffs roughly 50 50. um ep3 bets once again are linear and we're going to look we're going to look at examples of all these uh and then lp3 bets are polar Bluffs are pulled from a sex suited King X suited off suit High cards with nice uh removal and then keep in mind that when we're three betting off of like a 60 big one stack or a 30 big line stack the spr sax pot ratio post slop is going to be uh very small meaning um that you don't our Bluffs don't need to be making flushes um you know and straights a lot Simply Having High cards in these types of pots will be sufficient hand like king queen off uh plays really nicely as a three bet with short SBR usually a king or a queen uh will will be good uh you know that that's things change a lot when you play 200 big blind poker you your your Bluffs are uh hands that can make us like massive hands rather than just pairs so in position 30 big blinds 3x sizing again we are doing less bluffing as the stack size decreases we can't Bluff as much uh if that opens the doors to just getting four bet shoved on a lot so we just have to have more value and you see this in you know this is a post-law poker Theory as well um when you're when you play deeper Stacks you get to have more Bluffs on early streets and that's because of the amount of pressure you get to leverage against your opponents overall uh four streets of play uh when you're short you just don't have that much leverage and you need more value uh in your re-raising range ep3 bets are polar Bluffs pulled from high cards lp3 bets are polar Bluff bullet with height guards preventing from the small blind okay sizing you're going to notice is significantly larger we are going 4.5 x off of 100 bigs 3.5 x off of 60 and low the strategy is much different as well as you guys know uh we're using linear ranges meaning that we just three BET our best hands and then we're calling a section below our best hands versus Under the Gun were only three betting six percent calling 11. and I was looking at this today this is uh it's quite a wide calling range here even hands like pocket twos and jackknine suited are even be pipped from the small blind versus middle position worth rebending the top eight percent of hands calling 11 versus late position could have been 18 calling 10. now notice how much this three bet jumps up from six to eighteen uh based on what position you're in I would say that the pool pools are under three bedding overall but especially in late position I don't think uh anyone at the mid-stakes glow sticks level is hitting this uh 18 three bet you know and it's a 10 B pip so this is a 28 the you know a small blind is supposed to be b pipping 28 versus an out the open you just never see that happening um you know this is a huge difference 18 is very aggressive and then if you have you know if you have a pool that's having a hard time calling Three Vets enough this 18 can be kicked up a bit as well so 60 um so we're using a 3.5 x sizing Now versus Under the Gun seven percent calling 12. three betting versus Mt MP is nine through betting versus LP is 17. calling 15. so the shorter stack size here gets to VIP more than the deeper stack size uh you're going to be seeing that a lot 32 vpip versus a 60 big blind open and 28 versus a small uh I'm sorry versus a 100 big 100 big line set so 30 big blinds we're still using 3.5 x uh and this is the stack size where we really can't be three bed bluffing a lot because the opponent can just four bet shove a lot in our face so we this has to be kind of a value more value oriented our range top six percent top six percent and top twenty percent calling 12 12 and 7. all right betting from the big blind big blind three bets so we're using slightly larger sizing now from the big blind 4.5 4 and 3.5 very very tight versus Under the Gun and we're using a ratio of a 50 value fifty percent Bluffs so we are going polar the small blind was played as a linear three bet the big blind is played as a polar uh three bet and why do you ask well the big blind can call a bunch of hands profitably there's no one left to act behind um so it just plays much differently than small blind so we're bluffing a lot we're value betting a lot five percent total three bat versus Under the guns we're not three betting almost every versus Under the Gun and then versus late position that gets brought up to 16. and the Bluffs are pulled from pseudo connectors and then just some random nice hands with blockers asex uh King X and um just kind of like a sporadic amount of different combos I don't think it matters too much what you have uh what's combos you're using as long as your your three bet is at least 16 from the big line versus LP I think that's going to be more important and also just be pipping a lot in general UH 60 vpip versus about an open I don't think population uh could ever hit that so I'm sorry this is 60 call so it's going to be a 76 percent uh versus a button a button open off of 100 bigs and you see this actually increase as the stack sizes get shorter and that's because reverse implied odds are much less significant you know if you hit a low pair uh it's just worth a lot more when you're shallower stacked and when you're deeper stacked so you see the vpip climb here it's uh 79 and here it's 82 so it goes from 76 to 82 uh let's see 60 big blinds we're using a 4X sizing from the big blind um three betting six percent very very tight versus Under the Gun F value half plus like 47 of hands and then versus light position we have three batting 16 of hands half Value Plus calling 63. so very tight strategy versus uh under the gun and middle position opens in pretty aggressive versus blind opens 3.5 x sizing off of the 30 big blind stack three betting six percent you notice here the value to Bluff ratio is is constant and it's it was almost exactly constant in the other three betting uh grids as well so when you when you played 200 big blind poker with uh with no Annie you actually get it it becomes like 67 Bluffs and 33 value um and then as your stack size decreases it becomes more balanced like this just kind of like the post-wop theory that we always discuss so versus Under the Gun tight MP tight versus the button very uh aggressive three Bet 19 calling 63 so we're only folding 18 of hands off of 30 big so once the button opens pretty wild okay so now we just went over our three betting strategy we didn't go over specific hand combinations uh I'll show you guys you know the grids and go through them very quickly but you guys have a general idea of what the frequencies look like let me just make sure everyone's hearing me okay all right yeah this video up um so facing so we're going to look at facing three best now how to handle these three bets what are we going to be doing so when we open hijack plus one I just use this as a base um we open hijack plus one we Face a hijack three bet and we Face a by the three bet how are our strategies going to look so we're going to four Bet 19 of the time of which we're mostly going to have value sometimes bluffing so we're hitting them we're going to be four bedding about one-fifth one-fifth of the time we get three bet we're going to be four betting we're gonna be three four betting mostly value and we're four bedding to a 2.8 x sizing so we're getting smaller with our sizing why that's because the spr is decreasing yeah so we're using a 2.8 X4 by sizing we're mostly going to have it sometimes not our Bluffs are going to be like asex suited 82s through A7 Suited uh mostly just hands with blocker quality and hands that can suck out and play you know that will have good equity in a short spr pot calling 39 and folding 42. so we are V pipping versus a three bit the majority of the time here 58 of the time we're doing something I would say the pool probably Folds um close to GTO they probably over call after they race from early position and then over fold uh when they raised from late position it's just harder to play wider ranges you know and know that if you raise the cut off and get three bet uh you know hands like King eight suited our peels that's that's a tough one tough one to get so um versus uh button three bets after we open hijack one we get through that from the button and keep in mind the button is going to be uh three betting 3x or 3.5 x off of 100 gigs our four bet is going to be 18 so roughly the same one in five times we're going to be four betting 66 value 33 Bluffs we're going to go over the exact like value threshold like rb4 betting Jacks Plus or Queens plus here's you know we're going to look at that and then 33 Bluffs so we're rebluffing him same exact ratio also we're bluffing less because we're out of position generally that's just kind of what you're seeing is we we're bluffing less what we're out of position calling 47 only folding 35 uh so we're defending 65 the time out of position 60 big blinds same exact thing to Shorter stack now so we're going to be four bedding we're using a smaller sizing for one 2.5 x we're going to be four betting 18 almost exact same 4X frequencies almost the exact same value to Bluff frequencies but we're folding much less so we're folding 28 and 21. and this is uh kind of the same theory that we saw when we're defending the big blind when we're short stacked and we we defend the big blind we can do so with a very wide range um and then when we're deeper stacked we defend the big aligned with the tighter range we're seeing that same type of idea here and then it drops you know it drops again when we raise off 30 big blinds folding only 25 percent to three bets which is wild I don't think you see this happening um and then also the you know 30 big blind reopened from hijack one get three bet sizing for the four bet is all in only there's nothing else we're three betting more linear and that's just because we are going all in as opposed to you know erase holding parts of our range calling 50 folding 25 so just a ton of VP facing a three bet after opening uh this is from the small blind so different stack sizes the four bet sizing for this hundred big blind you know we we're going to be opening from either under the gun MP or LP we get three bet from the small blind the 4-bet sizing is very very small this is a fact a couple of reasons we are in position so uh we have an advantage post flop that's why we're sizing down and then also spr is becoming shorter so very very tiny four bit size here once we get three bet from the small blind after we raise under the gun or four betting very infrequently here all of these are infrequent under the gun fpop very infrequent 10 or below here when we do four bet it's mostly value in some Bluffs when we play cash games 200 big blinds you'll see this uh shift dramatically but off of 100 big blinds we just don't get to Bluff that much we mostly have to have value and we're just not forbidding that much now this says 10 that that does not mean 10 of starting hands that means 10 of the range that you open so if we if you opened 18 from under the gun 10 of that range would be 1.8 percent of hands which is you know something like Aces and Kings or maybe kings and queens and somebody's King and then you know Ace King isn't even considered uh semi buff at the stacked up calling 47 folding 43. uh folding increases a little bit once you raise from LP uh it's a decent amount of folding here um let's see what else let's jump to 60 big blinds so when we're at 60 big lines we are four betting much less we're going to be playing our hands with a lot of traps I think at this stack depth Aces is going to be played as a pure call um this why do we format so infrequently it helps out our overall range at this specific stack depth to have strength in our calling range when we call when we just call hands like Aces kings queens Jacks Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack king queen suited um the the small blind can't just Barrel off as much as he would uh be able to if our range was very very capped so the calculator just tells us the best strategy is actually to leave a lot of strength in our calling range so um very infrequent four bets calling the majority of the time and look at how low these folding frequencies are so at this specific stack depth um with the spr the way it is and the ranges you know the way we have our RFI set up uh this is a very nice just call and I have notes on what hands we're using here so only ace King and King King are four bet all in here got this stacked up everything else is called from MP only queen queen king king and Ace King are four bet all in everything is how every other value hand is is uh is just called and then from LP only ace King Jack Jack through 9 9 and 12 Bluffs so we're doing basically to sum it up we're doing a lot of just peeling in position uh we're playing very well against small blind it's very hard to play out of position that's why small blind is sizing up it's a disadvantage to be playing out of position and we can you know push our EV the highest by just flatting by just flatting heaps now this is a solver answer you know that we want to be slow playing all these types of hands uh I think in reality you probably want to four bet Aces and queens and Jacks a very high frequency because I think it's hard for a lot of the low segment sticks opponents to just be bomb bomb bombing off um when they're already starting with such a tight range pre-flop I think they're just gonna not find all of the Bluffs that they should you know I think that they're gonna just try to show down with nines a lot when they should be bluffing or Ace King a lot when they should be bluffing um so I think it's probably better to just fast play the top of your range as an exploit but this is what the solver says uh off of 30 big blinds now we're starting to really format heaps in position uh short spr were not calling uh very frequently at all and we're folding way more facing big blind three bets so three stack sizes same setup here we're raising from under the ground middle position in the late position and we're facing a through bet from the big blind um when we get three bet from the big line we're using a 2.3 x format sizing very small it's because we're in position and spr is small and then for 60 big lines 30 big lines we're just only using for about all of them uh if anything all right so we're not formatting a lot at all on 100 big blinds or 60 big blinds when we do it's mostly about we are calling quite a bit and we're folding about half the time um 60 big blinds four betting very infrequently calling a lot we saw this in you know versus a small blind as well the imposition player just gets to show a lot of EV by calling pre-flop um and then only folding only folding a small amount of time so we're going to be v-couping a lot versus three bets I think especially in many position it's going to be very hard for people to fold less than this you know if if the population's opening the button 50 of hands and they get three bet I think probably gonna see folding frequencies higher than this 42. uh you know which should also affect your post operations if if someone never ever calls three bets then you probably don't want to be buffing them as much post lop and you should shift your strategies wait away from GTO 30 big blinds um four betting fifty percent yeah and we're stuffing it a decent amount calling calling a lot and folding about half the time okay so the key takeaways from all of these notes um the big picture ideas here is larger three best sizing um is preferred when we're deeper stacked we saw sizing go from uh 3.5 to 3 if you're playing 200 big blinds you're three betting the 4X larger three best sizing when out of position and that is to deny the imposition player equity by just peeling which we saw people can do very wide linear three bet structure with many players left to act so that means if under the gun is opening we have a much different three bet strategy if we are under the gun one uh than if we were button and that is because of how many players are left to act when you're under the gun one with a hand like Ace Coin suited if you just want to get the pot heads up you want a three bit small and hopefully play the pot heads up um when you're on the button you can be flatting tons of hands because you're most likely going to be playing heads up or three-way uh so you don't have to worry about getting the players behind you um to fold with you know bad hands that are profitable Appeals um yep cooler and you know in uh in the same direction pull it through that structure with fewer few players left to act if the cutoff opens we can play a ton of hands on the button as a flat kind of like heaps of hands you can be paper 15 or 20. um so we want to be able to flatten a lot and then therefore we can three bet with uh three men with worse hits hands like King 10 off is too suited uh King 8 Suited more bluffing when we're deeper sacked um you know this is General poker Theory the more pressure you can put someone on later streets the higher your betting volume can be on later streets the higher your betting volume should be on early streets to leverage uh leverage that fact four-bet sizing is much smaller um when spr is should be that should be spr is short more for betting when out of position versus versus IP so you see a very agre we saw a four betting of like 25 percent um when we open MP and LP three events s and that's just because it's much more difficult to play out of a position than in position is much harder to realize equity you're always going to be uh you know acting basically giving the other person the petting lead not closing action uh it's just because it becomes more advantageous to four bet keeps um and take ships down pre-flop roughly one to one ratio of value to Bluffs we saw that almost everywhere when three betting you almost always want to have a one-to-one ratio of value to Bluffs unless you're going to be all in you know unless you're short stacked and you're going to be all in in which case you play more of a linear range you know or maybe like 70 percent value 30 Bluffs but anything above 60 big bonds or above you want roughly separation uh one to one ratio of valuables all right so let's look through my range converter so we're just going to look at my range the all of the ranges that I have on this website uh are from moncker the guy who makes it charges a time I think I played paid like three or four k for all of my pre-flop ranges but he updates them I don't think that you guys need these I wouldn't recommend buying these um I think that the ones on pokercoaching.com are sufficient um but you know I got these like two years ago and the guy's been updating them forever which is you know really nice but they're also very very accurate in the user interface is good um so let's explore some ranges here so let's say under the unfolds and these I think these are like the most accurate ranges you're gonna get on the market not that you really need them at midsticks but just so you guys know all right so we should see a linear three betting strategy we talked about this by the way this is um 100 big blinds linear three betting strategy uh almost only three beds not a lot of flats and all of the three bets are coming from the top see the top eight percent of hands okay so let's see how that shifts and only so vpip of 10. hijack you start to see the range become more a little bit more polar we have some worse hands being uh added to the three bet but we also have more flatting so the benefits of becoming more polar with your Bluffs is that you can now start flattening some of these hands um that we played as three bets before we're using a let's see 8.7 3.5 x sizing here and you know the value threshold pretty much like nine you could just make this like purely nines plus once to three buffer value and then Ace Plus one's three but for value and you could you know just play a simpler strategy where you you just played knives 100 pretty bad it's between 100 three bet and then flat Ace Jack suited 100 of the time um if you look at the EVS of like all the different actions of like three betting or calling here it's negligible and and it doesn't doesn't matter at all um if you're just looking at one hand uh so if you're up against you know a very very soft opponent maybe you just want to purely three bet and try to get the pot heads up with him um maybe you're up against Adrian matteos and you have King ten soon and you just decide to full recognize suit and just decide to fold because uh you know your Eevee isn't that good against him or maybe you just played the past three pots in a row and you have Jack 10 suited and you just decide to fold it because you know that if you with the flop you're pretty much never going to be getting folks post block because uh they think you're a maniac so you don't have an you know you don't have much fold Equity post-op so you just fully injected soon or maybe you haven't played a hand in three hours and you have Jack nine suited and you decide to three medal so you know playing poker executing correct poker play is you know there's a dance to it uh and as long as you're around somewhat around these pre-flop ranges you're going to be uh you know it's it's okay to make deviations especially pre-flop where the values aren't worth as much folding versus flatting versus three betting a lot of these hands is not going to make you a ton of money so anyway let's keep looking at GTO ranges so cut off so now we're seeing the ranges become more polar here lots of flatting uh hand Deuces five four suited getting very very wide here with Flats and it's becoming even more polar when we get to the button loads 6-4 suited as a v-pip 86 suited to Savita King five suit is a v-pip um all right and then the small blind three betting range is linear as we saw quite a lot of v-pipping as I mentioned in the uh when we went over this Deuces here is even a call Jack ate suited as a v-pip here so you're vpipping quite wide um always make sure that you're playing in flow poker is a game of flow if you know if you if you've been very aggressive you should tighten up and if you're then very tight you should you should be more active uh you don't have to you know you don't you could use all of these grids to find creative ways to play with the people who you want to play with at the speed you want to play with put pressure on on the right people all right enough of that big blind three betting very uh not very much debating at all six percent half of this is going to be Bluffs so we're three betting you know this Top Value region makes about three percent of hands Aces they're queens and Ace King that's you know it's amazing Point suited that's going to be about three percent hands and then all this red down here is going to be about three percent and it's 50 50. okay um let's look at some 60 big blind we'll look at this time we'll look at a middle position open foreign so we are shorter stacked now and we're opening from later position hijack we're seeing the same principles we're three betting to a smaller amount polarized strategy a lot of V pipping I guarantee you that everyone here is not calling Queen nine suited jackknine suited as much as they should be three betting 10A suited as much as they should be able to say generally the population is under three betting and under re-pipping pre-flop it's really just incredible how many hands that you can play and then we'll just look at a three bet here to see our response as an MP player so three bet is going to be 3x these two players fold and this is MP's response so we have about an 18 for bets when we do four bets we are going mostly 2.3 x so we're formatting about one in five times that we get three BET our four beds are going to come from Queens plus and then just kind of a mixture of different hand combos with blocker values like I keep saying you know it's not important that you are three betting Ace or four betting Ace to suit suited at this frequency um but you know these are the types of hands that you want to be rebluffing with from time to time and then over a 30 big blind uh 33. stack we'll do a hijack open all right so hijack is going to be opening pretty wide here 28 percent and there's not many players left to act so you're going to see a very very aggressive strategy from the players behind cut off um vpipping 16 of hands here this is the stack size where cutoff cannot be through by bluffing a lot because the hijack can just slam tons of hands if he does that so this is where you see him have mostly value like 70 percent value 66 or 70 value 30 Bluffs um as you can see here nines is like the bottom of his value range here for three bed getting it in Ace Queen so a ton of value in the three betting range and then uh you know only some Bluffs here and a decent amount of flaps but in the pipping 22 percent here mostly value with a three bet again and just using a selection of these uh combos at the bottom of the calling range to three bit the small blind I think we'll play so the small blind is just going all in about half of the time that it three bets and three betting small about half the time so three betting about 12 percent here uh slamming the hands in red and then three bet inducing these hands three bat folding some of these hands and calling all of this area green area and then we can see the crazy big blind uh calling folding 27 hands V pipping 73 of hands three betting mostly value it's going to be 70 30 again and uh it does have just a piling range the dark red is piling the orange is through betting smaller and yeah such as heaps of heaps of v-pipping let's have them three bet here and the hijacked player is trapping with Aces Kings Jack's tents nines trapping with Ace Queen only going all in Ace King is Queen and queens and calling as wide as 0.9 King 7h 10. okay so that's enough on free flop now I have some great post lock shortcuts for you guys the biggest one um that I like is just very simply C betting 100 frequency as the three better when you're in position you can see that every single I'm sorry you can see that 100 frequency for a 20 size when you are the three bed aggressor in position and when you're out of position you can see bet 100 frequency 35 sizing um as a three better and I would recommend that you guys do that as a baseline And if you want to get more creative from there uh once you start playing Iron Stakes then you can do that but that is the most incredible Baseline it's the same shows the same EV as uh GTO and then it's also incredibly hard to counter when someone is facing a very high frequency small C bet size a they have to continue a lot and B they have to raise a lot they have to raise more thinly for Value that's a part of the game three that's much less studied uh you know they have to raise thinner for Value then they have to know how to play turns and rivers and this is all out of position versus a range that should have a lot of nut hands it's not easy so um as a baseline just 100 C bet as the three bot through that aggressor when you're in position you go smaller you get about 20 pot and when you're out of position go larger 35 pot I can prove this in node lock I have some Sims here um to show you and go through the proof on that all right so first tree I have here we have button versus cut off cut off opens button three bets but uh cut off calls the Flop is eight seven four and we're just gonna look how to play this on the floor the in positions range looks something like this a lot of strong hands out of positions range looks something like this and by the way one of the one of the reasons why I'm spending so much time on pre-flop today is once you understand what ranges your opponent it's good for yourself to understand like what you should be playing but also understanding what your opponents are doing because most people are getting pretty close to GTO nowadays but being able to assign your opponent a range going heading to a flop will make you will allow you to have much more accurate decision-making post law so this is stuff you really need to study and you can't look past even if you think your pre-hop ranges are great um you know always be studying so that you can understand your opponents better and generally I would say you know populations probably just don't three bad enough uh with Bluffs um so factor that in and they also probably don't be pip enough when you play enough poker you start to understand like you know people aren't vpipping pocket twos and pocket threes every time you open the hijack it's just not happening Queen a suit is just not happy so uh you know signing your players your opponent's accurate range is very important so in position range looks like this for the three bet cut off out of position range looks like that we have an eight seven four four flop I specifically chose this flop because it's one of the worst flops for imposition this flop should be much better for out of position but guess what you can still see about 100 frequency for a small size this is the GTO solution for what a this um is the GTO solution for what uh our strategy as the C better should look like all using all these different sizes sometimes betting three into 14 sometimes spending six into 14 sometimes putting 11 and 14 very complex strategies mixing checks um and you can see the EV of the imposition player is 8.12 8.12 on average the in position player is going to collect from this 14 big blind pot so he's getting you know a little over half pot share so the IP player has on average is going to get 8.12 big blinds back now I have the node locked SIM for what happens if we just bet three which is 20 pot at 100 frequency that's why all these boxes are red um UV of Ip 8.06 so it went from 8.12 to 8.06 foreign foreign this is point four percent posture that we're losing by just using the simplified strategy of betting 100 frequency for 20 sizing if you guys want to know how to do no locking yourself um I can just show you here let's just say we bet at calls turn this to two of Hearts this guy checks you just find the note of the tree that you want to that you want to lock um so I'm just going to lock this turn strategy so turn this is what the strategy looks like in GTO if you want to node lock and play around with it you would just go to set strategy set strategy and lock node you're in here and what you're trying to do is change this grid into different colors based on how you think that you are going to play or your opponent is going to play and you can do so by messing with these strategies right here there's one two three four five five different options here on the turn if you want to fix something and lock it you just click fixed let's just say uh we wanted to bet everything we're just going to fix fix a 100 percent large size bedding and then you can leave everything else as proportional but anything that's locked as fixed um will that's that's Auto locking a strategy and then if it's marked proportional that means that that strip strategy adjusts based on your fixed strategies so all of this all of these proportionals that are somewhat yellow right now all of those will turn pure gray because we have locked and we have fixed this grid here then you click on block all hands set strategy and close and then you just click go where you run this in so this is not only good for testing pure strategies on flops but it's also good for testing how you think your opponents are going to play so for instance I can go in on that flop and I could say I think my opponent is actually going to fold you know 35 percent instead of 40 percent and I think he's going to float with these ends you know maybe he's a maniac he's only going to fold let's say he's only going to fold 25 so I would go in and I would adjust the opponent's strategy facing my bet down to 25 lock it rerun the Sim and then the next time that I looked at my C betting strategy it would be different you know it would be much less Bluff heavy it would just be more value heavy uh you know and this is what this is how the top players study by the way I talked to Top Cash game players on ACR right now you know what are you doing that's making you the most TV in your games oh I really like to node lock I just kind of I play 40 60 hours a week I have a feeling how my how my opponents are playing or I play against knit and then I play against lagtards so I just go in and I know lock what I think that their strategies are and then it helps me create better strategies to exploit explain what they're doing so this is running click stop check out the new low check out the new sim it'll be 100 but uh and that's how you study this stuff or you can just watch videos with me and I'll just tell you the shortcuts so we're going to go to this next flop this is hand number two small blind versus button so this is button raising um small line three betting and then buy them calling so the small line is going to the three bed this 16 17 of hands in position player flaps with this look at all the strength in this flatting Ridge Hot Wings King's Aces all right ten seven five flop um this is the GTO strategy tons of mixing we have 18 big lines in the middle different bed sizes 4 7 14. there's checks uh you know very complex decision grid what's the expected value of out of position player the small blind guy that we're studying it's 9.96 okay so on average he's going to make 10 10 big blinds out of this 18 big lead pot all right let's go in and let's node lock the small blind to playing a pure strategy of that for one third pot so now it's just gonna appear about 6 and 18. all right simple enough e-e-o-o-p-e-v so this is the EV of the small blindness 9.866 now so it dropped from 9.96 9.96 it dropped to 9.8866 from this incredibly complex strategy to just peer betting so 9.96 minus 0.866 divided by she's 18 ships in the middle so half a percent you're losing half of a percent by playing a more simplified strategy um and I looked at the same before and just so you know this is a really interesting Sim um the imposition player is only folding seven percent of hands and is Raising five hands like Aces kings and queens are played as pure calm uh really interesting output you know and keep in mind that um that strategy of 100 C bet for one third was taking into account that this guy's only going to fold seven so if this folding frequency in real life is 12 then it becomes even better to be using uh high frequency small sizing on the flop all right so the last hand we're going to go over um we're doing big blind versus big blind three bet versus a button call same exact thing we're just testing our Theory with high frequency small size C bet um big blinds range looks like this pretty aggressive 16 three but a and eight it's going to be about eight percent value eight percent Bluffs here uh and then in position flatting range looks like this a lot of strength all right Queen ten two this is the GTO Station sorry uh lots of half checking lots of big betting uh 14 into 18 7 into 18 4 into 18. Evo p is 9.7 and then I just locked it 100 C bet one third pot PV of out of position is 9.5 9.7 minus 9.5 option uh nothing just by just playing this simple strategy so just keep in mind just remember that when you're in position you go much smaller you go about 20 pot on every single board and then out of position you size up to 35 percent pot and you will be printing okay thank you guys for joining um goodbye", metadata={'source': 'MvzroVBwogA', 'title': 'BEST TIPS on 3-BETTING From James Romero', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 20907, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvzroVBwogA/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-10-19 00:00:00', 'length': 3172, 'author': 'Jonathan Little - Poker Coaching'})]
[Document(page_content="what's up guys Evan Jarvis here for pokercoach.com and today we are going to talk about an extremely important Concept in poker knowing when to quit the Old Saint from rounders was when the money's gone it's time to move on personally I think that we can quit long before the money's gone and we can follow a better Mantra which is don't let one bad session wipe out four good ones in our previous presentation we talked about how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year playing online poker and part of that is going to be all about protecting your losses and minimizing your losses during losing sessions and maximizing your gains during winning sessions so let's talk about the Baseline methods of when to quit there are two methods you can use that are your Baseline for when to quit your session to protect yourself from catastrophic losses and help yourself get your maximum gains the first one is to set a set time and I learned this from daily underground use master class I use this when I was playing online poker sessions as well and it was to check in after a certain amount of hours to ensure Peak Performance for me when I'm playing online poker and multi-tabling I find that putting in about two hours of play allows me to stay at my a game and then after I hit the two hour mark and a lot of times even at the 90 minute Mark I start to see a slight drop-off in my play which progressively gets more and more pronounced until the point that I'm at the two and a half three hour Mark and I can see a significant decrease in the quality of my play now for you that might be a different amount of time and I invite you to watch your play and check your time while you're playing your online sessions and noticing at what point does my quality of play start to drop off at what point do I stop going and after the pots that I know I should be going for and play more aggressively at what point do I try to protect a wind that I have at what point do I start playing more passively for example and consider checking in at that set time every time you play a session to determine if you want to keep playing when I'm playing live poker on the other hand that number tends to be around four hours as opposed to two because well in online poker I'm multi-tabling I have to make a lot of decisions very quickly processing statistics live poker is a much slower Pace there's a lot less information coming in that needs to be processed and digested and therefore there's a lower drain on your brain while you're playing live poker which leads to typically being able to play longer while still being in a state of Peak Performance so again for me The Sweet Spot is two hours of play online I like to do a check-in and when I'm playing live poker at the about the four hour mark I do a check-in and we'll talk more about why on a future slide for you it could be anything it might be 30 minutes it might be an hour for online poker it might depend on how many tables you're playing that's typically a key factor and it will evolve as your stamina does so another thing you can do is check when you're one tabling at what point does your play start to drop off well whereas when you're for tabling or six tabling or nine tabling or 12 tabling at what point does it seem like your play starts to deteriorate and make note of that so you can be more conscious in future sessions and make better decisions about when to check in so that you can ensure you are executing Peak Performance when you play your poker sessions at least the majority of the time if not all the time the second Baseline method that we can use when deciding when it's time to quit a session is a stop loss and a stop loss is typically an amount of money that we know once we lose more than that amount of money we're going to hit a state of numbness we're going to hit a state of kind of no return and there's no way we're going to be able to recover the quality of our decision making once we hit that point now typically this is a pretty significant loss amount for me it's probably around eight buy-ins in online play and typically around four buy-ins in live play that when I hit that point I know it's very unlikely my quality of play is going to come back because I'm going to be in a bit of a chasing mode and I'm going to be in a bit of a frustration mode so for you it's probably going to be a different number than the ones I've outlined but it's good to be aware of it and take note this is a number that should rarely be hit you're very rarely during the course of a session going to hit the point that you have to execute your stop loss but that's kind of just a hard stop that will protect you from continuing to play when you're frustrated almost guaranteed to be tilted because you've hit this kind of volatility threshold of the most negative variants that you can withstand before you're just thinking I'm done with this game I can't stand it but you still might be chasing so we'll talk more about that on a future slide as well so we can expand and talk about a more conscious approach to both why these two things are really useful and as well as a method that we can use that's not just a baseline method but that's a bit more intuitive and allows you to really maximize your gains these are more about protecting your losses the intuitive method the conscious approach about maximizing your gains so let's take a look at that setting a time to quit which will give us a bit of a deeper dive into the mental Game of Poker and first question is why would we set a time to quit a session you know why wouldn't we just plan to play Forever and quit when we get tired well the thing is when you're playing a poker session you're probably going to be at your best at the beginning of a session when you have the most energy you have the most mental energy you have the best state of focus you have the most motivation you have everything working in your favor and you want to get in your reps when you're in that state the same way when you go to the gym to work out you typically want to do a short workout for a set amount of time you know maybe 30 to 45 minutes or an hour if you really want to push it so you can get really quality reps in and train your muscles in a way that they're um that they're working at their best when we are training our brain when we're playing a poker session we want to make sure that we're getting those quality reps in so that we're focusing on doing the right things having the right habits focusing on the right things because the more we train a habit in this case making poker decisions the more likely we are to access that state as a default when we are playing poker sessions whereas if we put in a lot of poor quality reps we put in a lot of sessions when we're really tired when we're exhausted when we're chasing when we're gambling that's going to be the programming that gets imprinted into your mind and is going to be kind of your default for how you play and we don't want to be training the low quality Play We want to be training the high quality play so setting a Time ensures that you get the quality reps in when you're playing at your best it helps you build the habit and stamina and also allows you to see I can play poker for an hour and that's just fine I can play poker for 30 minutes or do a study session for 30 minutes and I'm going to get quality out of that that's going to pay dividends later not every session has to be a marathon session and um that's one reason when it comes to tournaments that practicing with sit and goes is very useful over exclusively playing large field mtts that are going to take a very long time this also ensures it's easier that you can actually show up and get your time in and get your reps in because becoming a fantastic poker player a world-class poker player is all about consistency and getting those quality reps in not just binging on a quantity session so that is the benefit of setting a time to ensure you get in there now let's talk about the risky times to play so that you ensure that for the most part you're going to be getting quality reps in so when you have unmet needs or unresolved issues before you sit down and play a poker session those are going to come with you to the table and they're probably going to negatively affect your play so there are four main things four main states that we're going to be in that are typically going to lead to negative play the first one is being hungry obviously if you're hungry um your your brain's not going to have all the fuel it needs to function exception is if you're used to fasting and it's going to be a lot easier to get tired and it's also worth noting the longer that you play you might get hungry because our brain is using sugar to make those decisions and when we run out of fuel and we run out of reserves our body doesn't know what to draw from to make those decisions so it's important that we check in with that set time to say oh am I hungry do I need some food okay cool and then we can refuel the mind as opposed to just running on the adrenaline and running on the dopamine that comes from you know plain awesomely fun games like poker second state is when we're angry right if you're in an angry State you're probably not going to make those calm rational decisions it's much more likely that you're going to end up making emotional decisions and we don't want to have emotion at the poker table also note the longer you play events will happen that can cause anger or tilt examples are bad beats examples are missing out on a big draw if you you know expected to that drug entitlement were you entitled to a pot that you end up losing being around people who are in a negative State being around people who are complaining little frustrations that can happen at the casino there are many events that can happen you know noisy TV noise the other tables that can lead to feelings of anger so it's important over the course of a session to check in at that set time and be like have I hit my threshold of emotional capacity and I can't handle it anymore and I'm kind of breaking down maybe I need a reset or maybe I'm fine next one is when we're lonely the less social we are typically a former state of loneliness that can lead to a bit of a like depressive feeling and it can lead to needing to get a win from the session to create a positive feeling because we don't have that positive feeling already as a baseline um a lot of times we're sitting in the poker table since it's a battle it's a bit of a war we feel like we're sitting with enemies and that can lead us to feel progressively more lonely yeah so being social at the table is going to help to decrease that and diminish that but also just checking in at that you know two-hour Mark or four hour mark or whatever it is will be very helpful and then maybe you go talk to your poker buddy or make a phone call or do something to reset that will allow you to feel like you know you're connected and you're not feeling lonely and that'll help with that need uh last one is when we're tired obviously if you haven't had a lot of sleep your brain's not going to be firing at its full potential and it can lead to making less than Stellar decisions note the longer that we play the later into the night it gets we are going to be feeling fatigue we're going to be feeling tired that's where you know typically people use coffee and espresso and stimulants that will help um and it's it's important to gauge the quality of the game to decide if it's worth using you know something like caffeine to keep us going or if it's better to go get a good night's rest and come in really fresh with that higher quality sleep and higher quality energy okay all these things are natural all these things can happen so checking in at a specific time to see am I hungry am I angry am I lonely am I tired is very useful because when we're in the game it's hard to check in on those things because we're focused on playing but when we step away from the game we can actually check in on those things and say okay how am I actually feeling and then make a decision based on that so yeah cool all right so the best times to play counter to the risky times to play When the needs are met make sure if you're feeling fed calm connected and rest you're probably going to play your best poker and when you're in the middle of a session if you can check in and ensure that you're meeting these needs and resetting these things so you have a full tank of gas ready to go you're probably going to make your best decisions and get your best results coming into a session with the expectations you know I want to win big tonight or I want to double up fast these are going to lead to kind of typically forcing the issue because you have an unmet need because you have an unmet expectation so coming in with no expectations and just the intention to play your best poker is typically going to lead to the best results accepting that variants happen accepting that bad beats happen in another part of the game will also lead to having less of the frustration less of the anger working against you and allow you to just play your best poker being in a state of peace with what happens with where the cards fall and where the chips land to and in the long run you're going to be coming out ahead if you can follow that so Bizen either unaffected by events that will allow you to play longer sessions or if you have a difficulty doing that or you haven't built up the stamina stamina to do that then just be willing to make good quits when you hit those points when you're feeling off there's always going to be another poker game you can always play again tomorrow you can always play again next week it's not the end of the world to make a quit go home reset and get ready for the next one cool now let's look at a stop loss a little bit of a deeper dive why we would use it and the main thing is to avoid the point of numbness so when you don't feel the losses anymore because you've kind of lost so much in one session and you're so frustrated and you know there's no way to get back to even it's really easy to just stop caring entirely if you've played underground poker games you know that sound when someone's like chips chips chips and they're calling for chips all night and they just get buried for you know 10 20 buys and crazy amounts of money that are extremely hard to recover um it's important that we quit before we hit this point okay just like being blackout drunk where you've had where one's had too much to drink and they are making awful decisions there's such things blackout gambling where we've lost so much we're so disconnected from you know the the pain of losing and the feeling and the significance and the meaning of the money that we're just making awful decisions all over the place this is the thing that happens just like there's a risk of taking too much of a substance and you know being left in a really bad position there is a risk of taking too much risk during a session uh and busting your bankroll I've definitely done this before in my younger years and I have no problem uh admitting that and sharing that so it's important to have this stop loss to say I know that when I lose whatever it is four buy-ins six buy-ins eight buy-ins that my quality of play is awful and I'm taking tons of risk and splashing and playing loose and so when I hit that point I'm just gonna quit I'm gonna have a hard stop and rarely are we gonna have to reach this but it protects us from the catastrophic losses that can just wipe you out wipe out your bankroll and all that so an important thing is to make sure your stop losses aren't too small like two to three buy-ins because that's going to be natural variance that's going to happen during the course of a session and if you have a stop loss of two to three buy-ins you're going to be quitting your sessions way too early and missing out on plenty of opportunity so it's important to be comfortable with the usual variance of a session and the swings that are going to happen and setting a stop loss that's more rarely going to be instituted but going to be protecting you from really low quality play when it does this is why we don't keep all our money in one place this is why we don't bring the ATM card with us to the casino while we don't withdraw from the credit card because we don't want to be in a position that we can bust our entire bankroll on one session of really bad tilting really bad decision making this is why your pocket bankroll the money that you bring with you to the casino is separate from your total bankroll the money you leave at home or the money you leave in the bank this is why your bankroll online is not your bank account and why we have money that we can play with online versus money that's cashed out and protected and will require time to get back and play because that time in between is going to be the time to reset and check in and say oh I can make some better decisions than this let me check myself and let me get my head back on straight now quality of play is more important than the quantity of hands played in the previous video on the channel we talked about how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year that volume is important to getting results but it's not just about putting in the volume focusing on Purely getting volume can lead to a trap and that is because not all sessions are created equal if you could play 50 000 incredible hands of poker Planet your A game your best decision versus a hundred thousand hands of average quality poker you're probably going to make more money on the 50 000 high quality hands than you will on the hundred thousand average chance and if we start adding in bad quality hands in there you can imagine how that's going to affect things so the quality of your play and the quality of your opponent's plate is almost like a multiplier on your winnings per hand and that's how you can see that playing quality hands is worth a lot more than just playing quantity hands when you're playing well and you're in a good game you like to squeeze as much juice out of the situation as possible and that's where we're going to talk about the more conscious approach to quitting that's going to ensure that you can make the most of your sessions when you're playing well and you're in a good game so take a note making good quits is more important than making your hand Target for a session a week or a month the targets the goal the amount of hands that we want to play is all about setting a Target to get us moving in the right direction it doesn't mean that we need to hit the target exactly the the check mark of completion is not necessary the important thing is moving towards the direction that we want to go and that's what having a hand Target per session or per month will do it's going to help you Sarah I'm going to sit down and try to play whatever it is 1 000 quality hands today 2000 quality hands today if you make it to 800 fantastic if you need to implement your stop loss after 200 hands because it's just the worst day ever probably better to do that than to force yourself to play 800 more low quality hands that are going to have a negative effect on your bankroll better to come back fresh and maybe play 1200 hands for the next four days to reach your target at the end of the week or just say if I hit 4 000 hands this week instead of five thousand it's still a win because I'm building The Habit putting in reps putting in quality play and setting myself up for a great year of Poker and potentially a great career of Poker so when we focus on Purely the quantity and we say we have to hit the goal and we have to get that check mark Goldstar whatever it is that can lead to forcing the issue which rarely works in your favor so while it's useful to have a Target we don't always have to hit it and if you feel like that's something you need to do I hope that takes some weight off of your shoulders I know it did when I learned that slow and steady wins the race and it's all about just following a quality Pace moving the right direction playing quality poker putting in quality hands and really just making those quality quits so let's talk about the finer approach of knowing when to quit now that we know the importance the value of making good quits and we know the Baseline approach which we're now building on so there are three things we want to focus on when following this Final Approach the first one is quality control how is the game and the questions that you want to ask yourself to figure out what the quality of the game is first where do you rank are you the best player in the game the worst player in the game if you're not the best or the worst and when you're the best you should keep playing when you're the worst you probably shouldn't how many worst players or fish or spots in the game are there and that's going to determine how much dead money there is in the game and How likely you should be to stay in the game if there are a lot of worst players than you if there are a lot of spots they have a lot of chips in front of them it's probably worth continuing to play whereas if all the weak spots are busted and everyone's playing really good quality poke you're just kind of average in the game there's probably not a lot of need to force a long session or force a lot of hands in that game so next question is how is the lineup who is winning and who is losing even if you're in a game with a lot of great players if they're steaming they're on tilt they've hit that point of no return and they're playing really bad poker they've become a spot so just because someone's a regular just because someone's typically a good player doesn't mean they're going to be a good player on every night and typically the players who are losing are going to be playing worse than the players who are winning and typically the players who are losing a lot are going to be playing worse than the players who are just losing a little so it's really value to look at who's winning who's losing and how much and using that to rank the quality of the game next is how is everyone's mental state it kind of ties into what I was saying before who's on their game who's tilted if you've got a lot of tilted players probably worth staying in the game if you've got people who are all on their A-game and you know maybe you're not there then it's not worth staying in the game and that would be a good time to quit next is the technical game and that's so the quality control is how is everyone else playing the technical game is how are you playing are you playing technically good poker are you following the material and the strategies you learned at pokercoaching.com the answer is yes you're good to go if the answer is no maybe you want to check in on that are you taking the spots as they come are you maximizing your EV are you playing aggressively and putting pressure on your opponents are you willing to take on risk if so keep playing if you're playing cautious if you're trying to protect a win if you're just playing kind of timidly passively it's probably something's going on and it's worth quitting the session to come back in sharper motivated more energized whatever it is third how are you feeling and again this is a check-in on you and this is the value of having kind of that two or three or four hour check-in Mark are you playing your A game B game c game d game e game or F game if you're you know at the top there the A or B can probably continue playing if you see yourself dropping the CDE or F game uh it's clearly a sign that it's time to quit the session okay so again just the key questions reviewing them where do you rank versus the players on your table best worst somewhere in the middle how many spots are on the table are there bad players recreational or dead money who has the most chips in front of them if the recreationals have none of the chips and the regs have all of them then it's probably a bad game even if it used to be a good game who is off their game what kind of bad beats have happened that's going to throw people off their game has there been Trash Talk has there been confrontation that's often going to throw people off their game because it's showing they're in a Charged emotional state did someone get beaten by their villain someone has an arch nemesis and that person's getting the best of them that's going to cause a lot of emotion and probably a lot of poor play is anyone getting too drunk is anyone stuck too much money that's going to lead to them being off their game did anyone come in kind of rattle before the session started and you can tell that they're just trying to get their emotions out through the game then that's probably going to lead to them playing poorly as well big question how much dead money is on the table what are your chances of getting it as I said on the previous slide a reg can be dead money if they're playing poorly and chasing losses so if you want to write down these five questions as kind of a check-in while you're playing feel free to do so it's very useful stuff to check in on the quality of the game okay so we have gone over the quality of the game we've gone over the quality of your play both the technical game and the mental game and we've gone through both the conscious approach the refined approach of knowing when to quit and the Baseline approach so let's go through these points one more time the Baseline approaches for knowing when to quit hey set a time that gets you to hit a minimum Target of hands gets you building the habit and gets you ensuring that you're putting in quality play and most likely playing in a Peak Performance State when you're putting in your sessions by having a stop loss you can limit the backwards momentum and guarantee kind of a maximum downswing per session this is how you can ensure that one bad session doesn't wipe out four good ones or eight good ones or something like that and ideally it's rarely going to be triggered because it would take a lot of negative variance for that to come into play next check in on your mental game by focusing on having a high quality mental game focusing on showing up when all your needs are met not playing when you have unmet needs you're going to ensure that you have the best return on investment per hand because you're going to be making those high quality expected value decisions next checking on the game quality this is going to ensure that you have the best return on time investment for the time you put in so again the mental game the game quality are about adding the multiplier to your winnings per hand the set time and the target number of hands is about ensuring you actually get a large enough sample to receive the rewards of your win rate and the stop loss is about protecting those really big downswings that are going to happen very rarely but can lead to getting a really bad mental and emotional state that can lead to poor play so stop loss set time is about getting the Reps in stop loss is about protecting from major losses mental game and game quality is about maximizing your multiple flyer and your earnings per hand and your win rate because this way you'll be planning games with high EV due to there being lots of dead money up for grabs on the table and you're going to be in your best state of mind to capitalize on that all right so that is going to wrap up this presentation on knowing when to quit and how to ensure that one bad session doesn't wipe out for good ones I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned a thing or two this has been

[Document(page_content="two of our coaches recently battled it out heads up as part of the advanced tournament course on pokercoaching.com that will be released on November 25th 2022. both these players are regulars in the biggest poker tournaments in the world Jonathan Jaffe has been crushing online heads up games for many many years and he has over 6 million dollars in live tournament earnings his opponent is Justin Saliba who actually just won his second World Series of Poker bracelet both these players know a thing or two about heads up poker these hands that you're going to see feature a big blind ante which is the structure you will be playing in a live poker tournament most casinos now use the big blind anti and you want to make sure you understand how to adjust your strategies to account for it it turns out you have to get in there in battle very very hard as you will see in these hands and especially one where Justin limps from the small blind Jonathan Jaffe shoves it all in for 40 big lines and Justin has to figure out what to do would you believe you're supposed to be making gigantic shoves like this that's what good poker is when there's a big blind Auntie anyway I hope you learn a ton and enjoy the lesson really big exercise we're fighting really hard for pots it's just not that hard to have um you know Equity versus each other's ranges and um in this format so it's interesting because I need to like even pay attention to my own mind because on this 10 10 3 it's kind of like that one board where it's like a middling board with the ace above it and I kind of thought to myself again like if he checks maybe I should check back my hand and it's very possible that I'm just checking my Ace too much to that spot because I don't want him to because when he checks he's obviously gonna have a pretty polar check raising strategy um so it's possible that I'm not not betting often enough in that kind of spot would be kind of reasonable to just push Equity with my hand checking is also pretty easy maybe I should go bigger then I'm gonna check but man it feels weird I wanna I really did kind of about 60 again there where's the running hot Emoji yeah nice answer I think I probably would have uh yeah 10 10 3 so disconnected then maybe I just bet for Value a little bit more often with the sand but yeah hip checks probably okay and this is kind of that same spot where versus a check um you would find some amount of check backs with this Ace nine right versus a check I would have found sorry say it again uh so like after check check flop turned Ace it's kind of like that spot we saw where it was like a middling board um Turned Ace again where like some of your tens are definitely gonna bet but you're also going to look for a lot of check raises so I think like putting some asex into a turn check back makes sense totally especially if you don't think your kicker is going to play so you're not getting the cooler so Ace nine you do think your kicker is going to play a chunk of the time but like you know when you're working with an ace four ace5 I I close to auto check those on the turn there's just so little incentive because you're not getting two streets often nice nice love that one and I have 10-5 over there so you dodged a little bullet yeah with that object I will say that you know you mentioned often betting it for value and I'm totally with you um I think I would mostly bet the ace nine and that's more product of the fact that um despite the fact that board pairs get um that too frequently like you talked about in our um smaller anti-video but um the 1010 boards are really good for the opener and I think part of that is a product of me three bedding so many 10x especially suited 10s but the other part is that your Broadway is which you have far more of than me are going to have a lot of Leverage to bump me off my 3x my pocket four stuff like that so you've got all this queen Jack king queen Ace Jack stuff that is going to have some leverage later on that's been nice whereas if we change it to 993 you're really lacking that leverage nice yeah I like that I like that that makes sense if you're enjoying this heads up content from two of the best poker players in the world just wait until you've seen their entire heads up battle and pokercoaching.com's brand new Advanced tournament course you can actually get 61 off right now head over to pokercoaching.com Black Friday check it out and I am sure you're gonna learn a ton what do you think about my race size like I just felt like it's just so hard to get paid here maybe I went too small but what do you think yeah I think I think you did the right thing here from an exploitative point of view I think I was full oh wait I folded to both didn't I I don't remember no maybe I called this yeah no I call I snapped this it was small um and I think I was gonna fold to the big size but if we go back just a second just to look at sizes um so you go 13. here's my pitch for going to let's call it 26. in general are you twice as likely to get called for this 13 than you are for the 26. I don't think so I maybe here exploitatively against me I think I was ready to make a fold against you but I can actually think that and still make the call um let alone like it just it's really tough to start executing Bluffs when your bluff size is this big and you have infinite combos of hands that can Bluff yeah you know when you call the turd you've got every Jack queen king Jack king queen plenty of spade combos um 3x you know like so many possible hands and you have to be able to have you know a chunk of raises here where I'm basically 10x and Bluff um and maybe even a bunch some King highs possibly um but yeah I think that for the people who are kind of always finding the small size I think we mostly want to have a bigger size but again I don't know I can be that critical because from a metagame point of view I think you probably chose the right thing okay okay yeah I mean you're talking about the Bluffs like twos through nines four five four I mean like there's so many hands right in my in my range so yeah I think I love like twos fours are awesome because you block me from my most likely Ace which is an auto call of course nice nice yeah yeah that's great yeah I think there's the lowest pairs to get counterfeited or are uh yeah pretty reasonable in those spots I really like how much you think about off-seat bases and most likely Aces and things like that even the case there's so many combos yeah I mean even with two Aces out there just knowing that I have Ace two and ace four maybe not close to Pure because I won't bet them on the turn always like I did here um but still there's eight combos of those you know that's a lot yeah yeah for sure for sure it's actually even a spot on the turn where like if I would have bet small I felt like I like if I bet small I would push Equity quite a bit on this turn like this um it's a spot where like the 9 10 9 Jacks can about far more often than like the ace nine right yeah um but yeah when I'm a big bet I think I just play check check a lot easier this is also a spot where I think that talk about robust strategies right like we talked about the Flop a little bit um I want to just like say a quick note about like board coverage a lot of players are going to be very polar on the flop in terms and they're never going to have an eight or nine in their range and so jeffy's gonna like if he's playing somebody like that is going to realize that and on an eight or nine he's just going to mash me with everything right so like I think having some board coverage in different lines is super useful against strong players because like if this nine comes and I can never have a nine here he can Bluff everything right I mean you would just be all in here with so many hands I would assume against a lot of different players yeah and I think you know what you're talking about here is that when you look to a big bat the instinct is to think polar Justin's got pocket nines Justin's got eight nine suited Justin's got Ace Queen and then he's got some cool Bluffs 10-7 suited seven six King ten all that makes sense and those are the first boxes you should check when you learn a big bet the last layer is the most difficult to learn which is this middle grouping where you're like wait I thought Justin said when we bet big we should be polar yes most of your range and then there's a small sliver that is the Ace nine the 910 that kind of like fits the middle group I can remember um I used pocket eights for like a pot sized bat on a jack seven five against Brewer in uh one of these high rollers and it just works really nicely where you pop the Flop you check turn basically pure and now you've got this middle grouping of hand whereas when you pop flop and check turn if you don't have that type of hand you never have value unless you're doing something silly like checking Ace jack on a turn yeah yeah I think that's great man I think that's great yeah and using like the pocket pair above the second card and the board is perfect right because like you're getting those that protection from the whatever it might be the 910 that has no equity but against your specific Canon it's kind of nicer to fold out and you're you're getting a street and a half of value from his uh middle pair or bottom pair while at the same time you know providing a ton of um protection against other stuff yeah yeah for sure so you find The Jam you've had value in the spot but I like your jam size it seems perfect to me seems like you're gonna be in this spot when you have that Queen low or that 4X you know that I have Bluffs um and very often you just have nothing there uh am I you know you're just gonna have a king 10 or whatever and I don't think my block is going to get paid much at all anyway so let's go ahead and jam take your you know Queen X and put it in a really tough spot and then which I don't think you have often but I think you know you could definitely big bet check like a queen three suited 100 yeah even some Queen 10-0 right Queen 10 oh Queen 7-0 like I think I definitely gonna find uh some amount of checks on the turn yeah 10-4 suited um and you're just in a tricky spot knowing that you almost never have a nine and if Justin does have Ace nine here I don't see how I don't lose all of it anyway yeah yeah 100 and definitely need to put some hands at the stocked up into a pretty strong limp range man it feels so bad to call 40 bigs I mean Ace hit suit is so good right foreign so look at this my my but my mouse goes to call yeah yeah it's now we're playing 40 BBS deep and this is a spot where should we bring up the 35 and see if anything comes up there and yeah well off that yeah absolutely probably a little closer than the 50 is yeah I agreed and I think that um I think that the 35 is probably the last uh last shoves that exist yeah yeah I'm seeing a bunch of shell yeah so look at this this is the first this is the 35 BB um big blind versus small blind limb strategy and so this is again a function of the fact that there's an entire big plan in the pot you have 35 big so when you shove you're increasing your stack by almost 10 right you're picking up the three bigs so it makes sense to have a lot of shoves now let's see small blind lamp first big blind Jam for 35 I'm peeling into ace5 suited 10 9 suited King Knight suit and so do you want to talk a little bit about Jaffe about one of the um adjustments that you were making it kind of yeah I thought you were going to overfold but I never dreamed you're gonna fall they say too didn't offense oh you're good you're good yeah I I honestly I thought you were going to be my best guess is you were going to be around 880 A6 suited um I thought maybe pocket fours and then I thought there was a portion of the middle like um actually I thought you'd probably be about King Nine suited so I was just off there I thought that might be a little lighter um but the biggest portion that gets neglected is people don't call off with Queen 10 suited Jack 10 suited 10-9 suited everybody like it just looks like you're not trying if you call with those yeah um so I think that gets neglected a lot where I think people may overcall and I'm projecting this is where I might is King Jacko that's about the only one I can see okay um but yeah I so if we see where I'm supposed to if we go back to the other chart um jams are coming you know the ones that I remembered was I remember the 9-6 suited because it's kind of on an island outside of what's below it there um eight six suited um I remembered that and then I remembered the ace lows although I remember them being more prevalent I thought it was like Ace two through ACE four were close to Pure which is not the case okay and I was not gonna [\xa0__\xa0] around with the top of the chart the Ace queeno Ace Jacko king queen I thought that that was garbage because I thought um I was going to get under called by the hands that I want there nice um so that was kind of thing and then I said you know what we're gonna Pump It Up to some even uh to some bigger depths and especially like if we have a 10 or the low Queen students because I didn't think you're gonna hit like a queen 10 suited call um so or um that type of hand class so I thought um that would be a good spot to just really stretch and um and just bang away yeah yeah man I mean like like even just looking at the spot I mean my immediate reaction is call but like it just is uncomfortable looking at a 40 big blind jam and I'm just like okay at this point you hadn't done this before and I'm like man okay so what's going to be the first hand that becomes easy to find this Jam exactly my mind just went two through fives Ace 9-0 you know that was just like at least nine interesting like I thought ace and I know in my mind was like just gonna be one of these hands that gets in there I was like I don't know if he's gonna find like you know the nine six suited to just rip here and stuff and so yeah this was a spot where I adjust in One Direction You adjusted the other and you were all of a sudden gaining quite a bit of EV sure and then it would have been really interesting if I wasn't showing my hands you know like what does this look like the rest of the way where you're just like what the [\xa0__\xa0] how many low pocket pairs is Jeffy getting dealt yeah I don't know and so I think that this is like I mean if you think which is corrected I'm over folding in these spots now there's obviously some Merit to the fact like okay 40 BB big plan Annie against a weaker player maybe you don't want to up the variants but you're finding a spot where you're able to gain a lot of EV by just shoving a lot of hands pre-flop here so so I think that's definitely something that I'm going to try to utilize in big blend any formats moving forward because like it might look a little bit silly and you're gonna get called and look silly but who cares I mean you're just gaining a lot of the EV pre so I remember maybe like seven or eight years ago I'm on break of some tournament at um WSOP and Taylor Parr is talking to me and Nick petrangelo he just got heads up um it's in the Thunderdome playing heads up in a 1K um wsfp event and he is tilted as [\xa0__\xa0] because he came into it with a pretty good chip lead and really deep it was maybe he has say like 90 big blinds and his opponent has like 40ish and he just like looks exasperated and I thought he was going to ask me for some heads up advice but he sort of was but not really the kind I expected he goes dude my opponent is shoving literally every hand literally every hand is all he does is shove and he's like what do I call with I remember I'm pretty sure he said is it like a state suited Ace 10 and I'm like sounds right to me but [\xa0__\xa0] if I know like man that's tough like you don't wanna like he knew he had a huge Edge he said he was a complete amateur his opponent so I'm like yeah I don't do we call like King I know like what the [\xa0__\xa0] do we do here how big is your Edge when a guy's shoving every hand and so honestly this sounds comical for like a training course but if you know you're outclassed by your opponent and you have very little heads up experience you're not doing that badly shoving like 80 of hands yeah yeah dude I uh it's a pretty sick strategy it's a pretty sick strategy you know and a guy like I mean a guy like Taylor Parker like when you get heads up in these spots like people who have the experience that's when you're going to create the biggest overfold right because when you have the biggest Edge you're not going to want to put in a lot of chips so exactly exactly like I realistically if I were to make my best guess if we started 60 deep and I had an opponent who's shoving every hand I don't know I think my Roi is maybe like five and a half or something like it's not some huge winning spot because on average you're going to maybe lose something like six big blinds before getting in an average of like a 58 42. nice like a reasonable guesstimate um and then you know uh if you're 60 big Minds deep against a player who outclasses you and you're not a heads up player you're probably losing more than five and a half percent I can tell you that like yeah yeah and and in this story you have this is before big blunt Annie yeah that's a good point I mean like imagine all of a sudden now you're winning an extra or whatever I don't know how much it used to be but like yeah you're stupid yeah yeah I mean and put yourself in you know the guy who's getting shoved on spots sometimes you go 12 hands without a hand that's better than King six for sure let alone you know people might fold King 10 very easily or a state soon cool man yeah I think that's uh and then so yeah you showed the king six suited I believe and I actually should have I mean this is one thing where yeah I have a lot of respect um for your ability to do this and it actually came from the um 1090 hand we talked about in the online Annie where you saw one hand and you're like okay extrapolating it in a ton of directions and I think I'm gonna I'm like naturally yeah yeah I'm like naturally a little bit slower but when I saw that hand I should have immediately adjusted and I I think I was adjusting a little bit but I think I should have really adjusted because I actually think I fold another big hand to a big Jam at some point in this yeah it's a yeah it's gonna be interesting to see how that how that progresses throughout the

[Document(page_content="let's get to bet sizing on the flop we're primarily going to be discussing continuation betting but we will also be discussing raise sizes in general so if you recall the tournament Master Class your bet size is primarily determined by who has the nut Advantage the range connectivity how well your opponent its range will connect with the board such as they have a lot of decently strong hands or they just have a lot of junk next stack depth and A New Concept for this course board Dynamics we're going to go through all of these first to make sure that you fully understand them first nut advantage the player has the nut Advantage has more combinations of nut hands in their range than their opponent and when you have the nut Advantage you bet larger and when you do not have the nut Advantage you usually bet smaller again there will be some Corner cases where this does not necessarily apply but these are general rules that will almost always hold true as a very clear example of this let's take a look at a spot where you raise the low track and the big blind calls the Flop comes either 10 8 5 or Jack five five in both these scenarios you have the equity Advantage by a pretty good amount notice we have 57 equity on 1085 and we have 60 equity on Jack five five some people may think that that means you should be betting more often on the jack5 but no that is not the case because we completely lack the nut Advantage because if you look at our range we have almost no effective nuts which would be fives right we have almost no trip fives in our range compare that to the 1085 board do we have 10 8 suited yes do we have eight five suited and no but that's fine do we have pocket tens yes pocket eights yes pocket fives yes Aces Kings Queen's Jacks tens all those are racist Queen kings queens and Jacksonville are really good Ace 10 is really good so on 1085 we have essentially all the best hands or the vast majority of all the best hands whereas on Jack five five we do not so that's going to lead to bigger bets on the 1085 board notice we should usually be potting it or betting sixty percent on the 1085 board whereas on the jack five five board we should usually be betting tiny okay here is a chart you can pull up in pile solver we will have a few tools available for you to help make sure you're making good use of piosolver in this course as well so make sure you check those out this is a chart you can pull up though that shows the equity of hands in your range based on the percentile that they are in so for example the worst hands in in positions range who is the low Jack in the scenario has about uh we'll call it 30 something percent equity okay the worst hands in the out of position player's range the big blind is going to have something like 18 Equity so the worst hands in both players range if you compare those the in position player's Equity is way higher and that is the case for All Hands in this range on the 1085 and anytime you see that the uh in position player the player the line in red if that if that line is decently far above the line in green the out of position players range you're pretty much always going to be betting big and pretty frequently and that's because you have both the range advantage and a nut Advantage compare that to this chart here notice we see the same pattern where the red line is decently above the green line all the way until the end down here notice whenever you're looking at the best hands the top 10 of hands either player can have the line in red now dips below the line in green and that's because the line in green the out of position player has a lot of fives and those fives have something like 90 95 Equity right these hands are crushing the in position pre-flop razor so when you see this pattern happening you will find that you have the range Advantage but you completely lack the nut Advantage so anytime these lines cross towards the end or even when they intersect a lot you're going to find that you usually don't use all that much big bedding as the in position pre-flop aggressor because you lack the nut Advantage okay so when you have the range advantage in another Advantage usually about big and frequently when you do not usually that's small and depending on how much Equity you have you're either going to bet frequently or infrequently if we had less Equity let's say this red line was much closer to the green line we would be betting even less often okay next let's discuss range connectivity ranking activity is how strongly the board hits your opponent's likely continuing range that they had before the Flop when your opponent's range connects well with the board meaning they're going to have stuff like lots of straight draws lots of flush draws lots of pairs Etc you're usually going to be betting larger and when the range connects poorly with the board meaning they have a whole lot of just absolute garbage you usually want a bat smaller and it is worth noting that range connectivity usually only applies when you have the range and nut Advantage if you do not have the range and nut Advantage then it doesn't really matter okay you're gonna find that nut Advantage is really a strong driver of if you should be betting using a big or large size but then once you do have the nut Advantage then some of these other um traits come into play a little bit more often so let's take a look here at King 72 versus King Queen 10 LoJack versus big blind again thinking about ranging activity of the opponent's range on King 7-2 if they don't have a king of seven or a two they're pretty unhappy right and they're gonna have a really difficult time continue against any bad so the scenario we see that we're using mostly very very tiny bets whereas on king queen 10 now we are using bigger bets in general I mean we have tiny best as well but we also are using a large chunk of 60 pop bats on the king queen 10 because if you think about on king queen 10 the opponent could easily have a pair which is pretty good they could have a jack which is pretty good or an ace or nine which is also pretty good whenever a lot of their range is pretty good that leads to you betting using bigger sizes next stack depth stack depth essentially determines your stack off threshold which is the point at which a hand becomes happy enough to get all the money in right away for Simplicity it makes the proportionally weaker hands count as the knots for example if you have pocket tens on eight seven four you're more than happy to get your money in 20 big lines deep but if you're playing 75 big blinds deep that may not be the case right so essentially when you're playing 20 big blinds deep pocket tenses the knots or the effective knots on 874 but it is not the effect of nuts whenever you're playing very deep stacked so your stack off threshold determines which type of hands are included in the idea of nut advantage and the deeper stacked you are the more nutted a hand must be to determine if it actually is counted as part of you are not range here's a very clear example of this where we are looking at an 854 board with a flush draw in this scenario 40 big lines deep you see that we're actually betting pretty frequently here over half the time 50 55 and hands like pocket tens and nines are just betting big sixty percent pot every time is trying to get money into the pots these hands are very happy to play a big pot we're also betting a lot of our nines and over Pairs and whatnot just very happy to get the money in and the reason we get to bet using a kind of big size is because all of those hands count as part of the nut Advantage but if you look at when we're playing just a little bit deeper 75 big lines deep you'll see now we are betting tiny 25 pot with the vast majority of our range and that's because now all these over pairs don't really count as the nuts because if you look at our range first off we don't really have seven six suited whenever we're raising a little bit deeper stack so we lack that hand we don't have five four suited so we're lacking bad hand compare that to this range over here where we have a little bit more of a nut Advantage with both those hands in our range some but more importantly when you do happen to run into one of the many better hands that your opponent and the big blind could very easily have you don't want to get stacked so you're going to find that that leads to you having way less of a nut Advantage when you have less of a nut Advantage you bet smaller okay if you're enjoying this video from the advanced tournament course then why not sign up for poker coaching premium and get the entire thing it is long it is in-depth and you will get full access to the entire course if you become a premium member right now you can sign up at pokercoaching.com Black Friday and get 61 off don't miss out next board Dynamics so again this primarily matters when you have the nut Advantage so board Dynamics primarily matter when you have the nut Advantage board Dynamics are essentially the idea of how likely the board is to change on the turn and or river such that the current nut hands are vulnerable to being outdrawn okay and if you have a large nut advantage the more vulnerable your nut hands are these are again effective not taipans are that you're happy to get in the larger your bet size will typically be and it sometimes it's kind of difficult to figure out exactly if the board is very dynamic or not because it depends on your opponent's range and also what is possible for your opponent to have so let's take a look at a board like Ace Queen 2 with a flush draw this is a very Dynamic board because notice if you have an effective nut hand playing 40 big lines deep like Ace King that's a hand you're very happy getting your money in with it's really vulnerable to being outdrawn notice for Ace King a Jack or 10 is not particularly great also any Spade Is Not Great a two and a queen are also not great so there's a lot of pretty bad cards in this scenario for Ace King that your opponent could very easily have so notice in this scenario we have a very clear rage Advantage very clear nut Advantage okay compare this to Ace King 10 with no flush draw now in this scenario if you have Queen Jack that's the super nuts pretty unlikely to get outdrawn I know it could get outdrawn but it's pretty unlikely to get outdrawn same thing for Ace King Ace Queen Ace track these hands are almost always good but also they're very unlikely to get outdrawn so again you see we have a very big range and not advantage and some people may look at these two charts and think all right they're pretty similar so we're gonna do the same thing in both situations but no absolutely not because the first board is very Dynamic Ace Queen 2 the flush draw compared to Ace King 10. so if we look at the strategies in this scenario you'll see that on Ace Queen 2 with a flush draw usually what's going to happen on these very Dynamic boards is you are going to bet very big with your hands that are almost always good but vulnerable to being outdrawn and they're doing a bit smaller with your thinner value hands so let's take a look at what's happening notice Ace King Ace Queen Ace track and Ace 10 and a some ACE nines are all betting pot they are betting big because they're almost always good at the moment but highly likely to get outdrawn you're also going to be wanting to bet big with your gut shots like Jack 10 King Jack and King 10. these are all hands that are betting very large and then we have a smattering of flush draws and backdoor flush draws bedding large as well so you have some sporadic Bluffs down here with the five fours and threes which is always fun um but I really want you to look at the hands that are mainly betting very big in the spot if you look at hands that are mostly betting small we have a lot of Low Ace X right have a lot of medium strength hands like king queen queen Jack Queen 10. some underpayers rights pocket kings Etc so a lot of the medium strength hands in the scenario are going for a small bet and then you're checking a lot of marginal made hands as well and I realize you know this strategy is going to be difficult to implement but we're going to discuss that in just a minute anyway though I want to show you that we have a range Advantage we have another Advantage but we're actually not betting all that often here because the board is very Dynamic and when we do bet we're usually betting very polarized with our big size and a little bit more linearly with our small size of 17 pot which is one big blind we're gonna discuss that in a minute too all right on Eighth King 10 the board that is way less Dynamic such that the current nut hands are way less likely to get substantially worse on this board we're just going to bet something like 60-ish percent pot with everything because we have a big range advantage and a big nut Advantage remember compare this board here where the entire red line is way above the green line by a large margin if you compare that to this board here notice that the red line and the green line were much closer and if you recall back that was the uh that was that was this board here the 1085 where we're betting pretty big most of the time but not quite as often right so we essentially have a much bigger range advantage on the 1085 board we have 57 Equity where is on the Ace King 10 board I think we had what 60 something percent equity yeah 67 Equity so we have a lot more Equity so we have more equity which leads to betting more often in this time in the scenario 100 and also we have a pretty big nut Advantage which leads us to betting very very frequently so you may have noticed sometimes in this section in this uh course we're discussing betting very big like pot and we're discussing betting very small like one big blind and we're gonna be discussing moving from rigid to Dynamic bet sizes Dynamic bets are essentially bets that allow you to bet any option we are playing No Limit Hold'em after all understand that adding these difficult strategies to your overall game plan will be difficult to implement without a lot of study and practice but look this is the advanced tournament course you all are here trying to do your absolute best you're taking it seriously so you know you'll study and practice you'll find that choosing to play a simple strategy especially in spots that you are not familiar with may not be the the worst case or the worst thing in the world though because it may result in you losing less EB than trying to implement a complex strategy very incorrectly that said you should learn to use Dynamic bet sizes because you're going to gain more expected value by correctly playing your ranges more accurately closer to GTO right you'll also take your opponents to areas of the game tree where they will not necessarily know how to play which will result in making mistakes and make you much more difficult to play against if you consider um spots where you bet one big blind on the Flop a lot of players don't know how to respond they don't raise often enough if you consider on the river whenever you over bat the pot on the river a lot of people won't know what to do they won't know how wide to call it off with but and learning these strategies will go a long way to helping you really improve your skills I mean if you consider down negranu he had a heads up match against Doug Polk a while back where he was using a GTO solver to study and essentially he started off when he was very unfamiliar with heads up poker he realized it he was using only a few bet sizes kind of like I recommended you all do in the tournament master class on the flop in the tournament master class I recommended one third pot or two-thirds pot bets and on the turn and the river I recommended a third pot two-thirds pot or an overbat fine you are going to be doing way better off than most players if you use multiple bet sizes like this but as the underground who study more and more he started using Dynamic bets and he started losing less who'da thought and as you start using more and more bet sizes you use Dynamic bet sizes your Edge is going to increase okay understand that as you get better and better you must get skilled at using various best sizes and this course is going to go through all the common spots where you should very very highly deviate from using one third pot or two-thirds pot size bets for example let's take a look at spot where 40 big lines the button versus big blind okay we raise button big blind call swap comes Queen five five GTO strategy for all available bet sizes if we let the solver use all about sizes we ran it with a bunch of numbers the out of position players EV is 2.837 deep lines that's the big blind okay but on Queen five five same same board if we only let the button use a third pot which is what a lot of people do out of position VB is 2.88 big blinds and that may not sound like all that much of a difference but by using the correct bet size when you do decide to bet which is one big blind in this scenario remember on these low pair boards you're going to see that um very often the right bet size is one big blind you actually gain 0.7 big lines per 100 hands assuming all things are equal against a good strong perfectly playing computer and you got to realize that even though 0.7 big blinds per 100 may not sound like all that much it's actually a lot because a good win rate in high stakes games is something like five big blinds per 100 hands or six big lines per 100 hands so if you can win point seven big blinds more just by betting one big blind instead of two on these common spots it gives you something like a 20 increase to your win rate which is gigantic and I want to make sure that you are aware of all of these gigantic spots without really overwhelming you with overly complex strategies we're going to discuss simplifying these complex strategies as well as we go forward now let's um consider what if you make the mistake of continuation betting 100 of the time on the queen five five board right here if you continuation bet every hand in your range for one big wind out of positions Equity is 2.932 Big lines which you know again is worse than if you played perfectly but not terrible right however if you bet a third pot every time their EV is 3.105 Big lines in this scenario so by making the same error of continuation betting 100 of time but using the optimal one big blind size when you do make that error you gain 17.3 big lines per 100 which is astronomical just by using the minimum bet in this common spot and there are lots and lots of situations where that will be the case and we are going to discuss coming up next when you should be betting very small on the plop and then later when you should be betting very big because if you choose the correct bet sizes in these rather interesting scenarios that do come up very frequently you're going to add a large chunk to your win rate also there's a lot of exploits that come from using various bet sizes as well and we'll be covering those in the exploits and adjustments section later but for now we're gonna be sticking to game theory for quite a while and I want to make sure that you know where to start and how to play a good fundamentally sound strategy so that then later you'll know how to adjust away from this to take advantage of whatever your opponents do incorrectly but yeah Dynamic bet sizes it's important and it's going to add a lot of money to your win rates I hope you learned a ton from this video from

[Document(page_content="we see Jordan picking up a hand that's much too strong to be folding here this time pocket kings off of just shy of 20 big blinds he's certainly going to be opening this we'll expect to see Feng folding the Robbie and action is going to fold around to the big blind Eric who has a nice looking hand when he definitely wants to take a flop with 6'5 suited and in a spot where he's getting very good pot odds as well now we see a monster flop here for Eric and this could be bad news for Jordan it's a spot where Jordan with his particular hand is usually going to have the best of it despite the fact that this board connects with Eric's big blind defending range a little bit better than it does with Jordan's hijack opening range we see Eric decides to lead at the pot and it's an interesting spot because if you're in Jordan's shoes do you want to raise for protection here or do you want to call out of concern for the fact that your opponent could have flopped two pair or a pair in a straight jar or something that has a lot of equity that isn't going to be folding Jordan makes the call in on this turn well rolls have been reversed it's now Jordan sitting on the better two pair Eric with uh three pair it's not going to help him out here and very curious to see if Eric will continue with the BET here um at this point any pair in Jordan's range is going to have Eric beat but perhaps Eric wants to bet to move Jordan off of some floats some over cards that may have called that flop bet because Eric chose such a small sizing it's interesting to note that if Eric had just gone for a check raise here probably would have seen all the money go in on the Flop but as played it will not be going that way now on this River Eric does have the option to represent Spades he has let out twice and it would put Jordan in a very tough spot but should he decide to check here his pair of sixes is not going to be any good and Jordan will probably win this pot with a check behind you go check now the question is it worth going for thin value Jordan decides it's a little too much risk especially with those couple of those short stacks in play checks behind and is going to be taking this pot down for 12 million chips all right next up we tune into the action with aces in the big blind for canapong I've got a couple of hands that could potentially get involved A7 suited being the most likely when folded to we would expect Timothy to probably shove here for 6.5 blinds with A7 suited but instead we get a raise from Feng Zhao off of 20 bigs with pocket threes not the most premium of hands and a pretty awkward stack size to be opening from I would typically expect this hand to Simply go in the muck but Fang decides he wants to play now the question is does kanapong want a three bed here and try to get it in against the strongest hands in his opponent's range are just slow play he goes for the just call here and I like it quite a bit we have a couple of very short stacks in play which makes for you know better three bet bluffing opportunities but Ace is a fantastic hand of slow play especially 20 blinds or shallower it's a flop that's got to make Fang feel pretty decent about his hand uh the board's paired meaning they're only five cards that can make a pair as opposed to nine and there are no face cards out there so he follows it up with a bet here post flop hoping he has the best of it I think I would love to see canapon continue with his slow play here when you get a paired flop with Aces your opponent's drawing very thin and often dead and I love that just call there now with 9 million in the middle 16 million behind not too much required to potentially get all the chips in canapong thinking about doing something fancy ooh I love this leads out for 20 pot a price that's so cheap it is impossible almost impossible for your opponent to fold a pocket pair and if they have something with any kind of draw they're continuing and if he has just an ace high type hand he's probably not putting any more money in the pot anyway or a king High type hand he's probably just checking back so I like this lead here ensuring that canapon gets to extract some more value from those pocket Pairs and also just takes a strange looking line that could lead to um you know a very light lookup from Feng River brings in the four of Spades completes the flush canapong blocks it and I wonder if we'll see him lead one more time it feels like something like 4 million could probably get called here he goes for 5.4 and Feng only beats well missed gut shots at this point the straight draw or the Spade draw got there any pair is bigger than a pair of Threes so he would need his opponent to have Jack nine seven nine Queen Jack or something of that nature to be good with threes he correctly assesses that part of the situation gets out of the way and canapong picks up a nice size pot thanks to slow playing the aces extracted an extra few million from that situation which wouldn't have been possible if he had simply gone for the three bet pre-flop all right here we have Eric Matson our former chip leader currently second place on the final table picking up Ace Queen suited under the gun it's going to be an easy slam dunk open for Eric and uh Timothy interesting spot here only on 5 million in chips still probably not worth calling here although he is the shortest stack he's getting decent these decent odds here but uh Samuel in the big blind has an interesting situation he's got a suited hand and more importantly he has the chip lead here and he's facing the second place act in the tournament this is the opponent against whom he can apply the most pressure possible because the second place stack has the most to lose by busting out early on this final table see go check check on the Flop and this is going to open up the door for Samuel to start barreling he's got a gut shot here which is enough of an excuse to bet his opponent has also checked behind on the Flop which means he's not that likely to be sitting on over pairs he's probably sitting on a lot of Ace highs and um I mean that's probably the main things he's sitting on here maybe some medium Pairs and so Samuel's going to take that green light and bet one third of the pot here now Eric has turned the nut flush draw two over cards we know he's not going anywhere he's going to be calling now backdoor flush strut does not get there and Samuel's got to think that Eric would have bet most of his front door flush draws those heart draws on the Flop and therefore pretty decent spot here for Samuel to go with a big bet here to see if he can move his opponent off an ace high or a backdoor flush draw type hand here obviously eight High not gonna win it Showdown it's not going to beat this ace high and it's not going to be the King High and Samuel goes for a very small sizing I guess this sizing is designed to fold out king highs Queen highs Jack highs not sure if it's going to get an ace high to fold uh given that Eric is getting such an incredible price here 1.5 million to play for a pot of 12. but we will see at the same time it does look like it's inviting a call and shows a nice bit of creativity from Samuel boost in here action on Eric Matson will he find the call and if he does he'll be taking the Chipley that's what he does finds the call eight high no good ace high is the winner and Eric Matson our new chip leader once again on this final table up to 75 million all right our next hand looking like we're probably gonna see round two between our chip leaders East Queen in the small blind for Samuel an extremely premium hand and King Nine suited in the big blind for Eric Samuel starts us out with a limp has to do with those same ICM implications we talked about previously a lot of short stacks in play and as the second place stack you do want to play cautiously against the one guy who can take you out of the tournament Eric as the chip leader can apply a ton of pressure to Samuel in position blind versus blind and so that's why Sam's keeping the pot small fortunately for him flops fantastic trip Aces Queen kicker and Eric actually catching a piece here with the King I think this is a spot where Samuel probably just gonna keep barreling here looking to extract value the queen does play at this point and um also a lot of the gut shots the queen Jacks the Jack tens have improved to pair the flush draws still have outs and we see Samuel sizing it up here looking to extract the maximum value from trip Aces if his opponent has that charging those flush draws a large amount so they're not as likely to peel and picking a size that a king may be able to call if you're in Eric's Shoes you're shopping with other kings you're beating the Bluffs and you're behind the aces he's got the chips he's got position he is going to look up his opponent and a Samuel River's a straight Ace no longer playing and a little less likely to be able to get value at this point what do you think the sizing should be if you're looking to get called by a King 5 million again or do you want to go for that large size 10 plus million to get value from the aces issue is all the aces that don't have a full house are chopping their kicker won't play so a half pot bat right in the middle seems appropriate will Eric look up his opponent it's a tough spot a lot of the hands that would be semi-bluffing have improved to a pretty strong hand here question is does Eric think Samuel would have raised most of his Aces pre-flop answers no he knows he's going to be mixing it up here and he knows what the ICM situation that chip Dynamics is there that Samuel's going to be limping in a ton of his range blind versus blind here he just kind of has to Eric going deep into the tank here and finds the fold correctly recognizing that there's just not much of anything left in Samuel's range that is just going to be pure air balling and bedding all three streets there all the semi-bluffs have improved and all the made hands have a king beat so a nice fold there by Eric on the river all right next hand we've got Samuel boost and looking at eighth 10 suited on the button and Eric Matson with Jax and the small blind blinds have increased since the last hand that we had to six hundred thousand one point two million stack size is still pretty similar our shorties have in about 10 bigs and our big Stacks have in about 60 and 70. Eric here as the chip leader I expect we'll see a three bet and what we haven't seen in some of the hands that were missed between now and the previous one is that Eric has been three betting Samuel a fair bit so with Eric three-betting a fair bit Eric having the chip lead Eric having position on Samuel I don't think Samuel's just gonna roll over and let this hand go despite the fact there are short stacks in place Samuel still gonna defend a premium hand like Ace 10 Suited and here we go it's a king queen Deuce flop giving Samuel a gut shot that's not that likely with Eric having Two Jacks and a backdoor flush draw but a pretty unfavorable flop for Jax here we're behind the Kings we're behind the Queens and I'm very interested to see how Eric is gonna play this hand out of position here in a three bet pot from a range perspective I think Eric has a slight Advantage here over Samuel so I think it makes sense for him to continue to bet um and a small size feels appropriate here especially with his particular hand that's looking more to maintain the lead in the hand get to a showdown as cheaply as possible not check and start facing very large bets I like the small bat here now on this turn with the Queen of Hearts Samuel can no longer win with a jack that would have him uh Dead with a full house versus a straight but he could still win with an ace or if he's able to take this pot away so be very interesting to see what Eric does Eric checks now the question is does Samuel want to attack this pot Eric could be checking the occasional king queen here he could be checking quite a few King x's on that Queen turn or he could have a hand like this Jax and like tens a hand like Knights that should Samuel decide to bet twice he probably could get to fold once Samuel checks the turn I think we're probably looking at these hands just going to Showdown curious to see whether Eric will do anything here other than check is there any Merit to going for a small block bet here what could he really get called by maybe a smaller pair probably not he checks and we'll see if Samuel decides to Bluff it it doesn't really make sense for him too if he was going to Bluff he probably needs to bet the turn and the river so instead we see this go check check and Eric now extends the chip lead next hand we see an absolute monster for istf and pocket kings in the hijack Jan Faye fresh off his double up probably not going to get involved with these fours but I do think we'll see Jordan Sperling get involved with this Ace 10 from the big black the question is off of eight bigs here as the short stacked as you want to just shove it here against istvin or does he want to play a little more conservatively take a flop see if he can flop something like an ace or a 10 before deciding to commit the rest of his chips the pay jumps here are very big the money very significant I couldn't fault him for playing it a little bit slow and there it is Boom Shakalaka Ace is full of tens on the flop for Jordan spurlin isfin no longer having the best of it with Kings could only catch up by spiking a two outer let's see what he does there's still some value to be had from a lot of Jordan's defending range the gut shots can continue pair of tens can continue small pairs probably would have been all in and I like ESPN's player he's just betting the minimum keeping the BET and lead in the hand betting a size that can extract value from those hands we mentioned before and also set himself up to lose the minimum when his opponent does have that Ace or in this case Ace is full of tents where istan's drawing dead forgive me if I said that he could catch up with the King because he most certainly most certainly cannot catch up with anything at this point I think we'll either see yes a small bet once again or a check game plan here is probably to bet small to then check behind on the river and his thinking probably that if he checks behind here he'd be facing a larger bet on the river than he would be if he just bets himself 1.75 million we'll see if that comes to fruition Jordan checking expecting to still get value from an Ace and it's been all things considered despite getting out flopped there play the hand pretty well to lose the absolute minimum nice hand is fine and uh nice chip up for Jordan and we are now down to the final five players on this WSOP Main Event final table canapong picking up Ace Jack here Samuel boost in with a hand that definitely can continue the question is will he just flat will he three bet he's gonna flat and all right we've got some interesting stuff here catapong with the nut flush straw Samuel with a spade I think we'll see a bet here from kanapong doesn't need to bet big yeah and for this price Samuel probably going to continue he's got ace high which is the best hand sometimes he's got some Equity with that eight of spades sometimes and now he's got himself a flush unfortunately for him Kana pong has the nut flush and this is the time for canapong to go for value if you wanted to you know get hero called by his opponent he's only going to get one more street so checking behind and betting the river not that much better than just betting the turn and checking the river not that he would ever do that but against the Spade hands that his opponent could be holding those flushes it's important that he bets the turn and the river to try to extract as much value from those hands as possible I like this half pop bed here Samuel's probably going to be calling with almost any Spade and then canapon can size appropriately on the river to try to get paid if you're in his shoes you got to ask yourself am I only trying to get paid by the King of Spades am I looking to get paid by the Jack and the tennis Spades the eight and a seven Spades or all Spades and based on what portion of your opponent's range you want to get called by you bet accordingly the narrower you're trying to get called by the bigger you bet you'll get more folds but when you do get called you'll also get paid more so that's kind of the art here of bet sizing on the river kanapong thinking about it trying to decide what that perfect size is going to be and he says three quarter pot is the amount Samuel has a bluff catcher here he's got to expect canapong probably wouldn't bet this big with the 10 of the Jack of Spades so it's the king or the ace or maybe even only the ace and therefore does it make sense for Samuel to look him up here we can see the cards we know the answer is no but in game it's a very different situation if he calls and wins he'll basically be in second place and there'll be three short stacks if he calls and loses he'll be in third place if he folds he'll be in third place but it'll be a lot closer important things to consider when facing a big bet be it all in pre-flop or a big river bet ask yourself what would my chip position be if I just fold well my chip position be if I call and win well my chip position be if I call and lose and based on all three of those possible outcomes it'll really help you to determine whether or not you want to take the chance you want to take the variance on making that call because um ICM is a thing and your chip stack relative to the other ones is very important in determining that calculation Samuel really giving this one a full thing does decide to make the call and he's going to get the bad news from Kana pong who shows him the nut flush and takes that pot down to chip up to almost 100 million all right in three-handed play Eric Matson back in the chip lead with 130 mil canapong in second with 120 in feng Xiao third place 48 million for 24 big blinds got a couple of playable hands here Queen nine on the button King 8 in the big blind and off to the Flop we go which is absolutely fantastic for Eric flops top and bottom pair Fang Zhao sitting on a gut shot and I would expect we'll see a bet from Eric probably on a slightly larger size here given that his hand needs a lot of protection it's a very draw heavy flop and yeah he's going about 50 percent a little over 50 percent here Fang with a gut shot not a whole lot going on don't know that he needs to continue on this board he does have a gut shot but not much and there it is okay turn to King it's not the best hand and it should slow the action down as well there's a one-liner to a straight now 10 makes the King High straight Eric's sitting on two pair Fang top pair now Eric checking back makes sense um doesn't expect he can get two more streets of value from worst hands so he's just gonna check back guarantee he doesn't get check raised take this thing to Showdown and go for value on the river Fang checking and now Eric with a full house could go for a large bet here at this point a 10 is not going to be folding and therefore air could go for a very big bet here to go for some big value against that portion of the range I don't really expect Feng to be calling here with a king I think with a king we're probably looking at about 10 million is probably about the cap for how much he's going to be willing to call here but we'll see what Eric decides to go for he's going to go for almost 30 million and wow Fang Xiao snap calls it guess he figured his opponent was bluffing didn't expect he'd bet that much with a queen or 10 I don't know either way fantastic heads up action Eric has built his chip lead back up just a little bit blinds are still where they were previously ganapong picking up Ace Jack Eric deciding that the queen tray strong enough hand to defend and to his liking he's going to be flopping top pair great board for canapong to fire a small bat here got the range Advantage got position no need to bet big and Eric now turning trip Queens he's gotta feel like he's got the best hand the vast majority of the time at this point and it looks like he's thinking about doing something little and or unorthodox here leads for a very small amount not your typical play but one that uh often leads to your opponent spazzing out a little bit players with the pre-flop betting lead generally don't like to fold when faced with a small bat especially you know a lead out or a dog bet and Eric Gets the call from kanapong who's drawing dead now the question is what is he going to do on the river will he continue with another small bet try to eke out a bit more value is he gonna check Fame that he's given up no going for a small bet again and now if you're in Cannon pong shoes what do you beat you don't beat a queen you don't beat a six you don't beat a five you don't beat the straight draw seven four seven eight four three pretty much everything got there so can a pong can't really beat much but decides the price is too good and just cause a really nice play there by Eric um taking a hand that he knew was best against a hand that had no equity and extracting extra six million in chips two and a half big blinds from the situation where had he just checked her and that thing's going check check check all the way down to the river so uh nice funky line there to extract max value it may not seem like it a lot but to every big blind matters and every chip adds up so um great job using that line five six suited here versus Jack 10 suited I think we'll be seeing some action here Eric limping in guaranteeing that he's going to be able to see this flop even if kanapong raises if it's anything you know short of all in Eric will be able to call here and take a flop it's what he does and oh yeah potential here it's top pair good kicker for canapong it's an open and straight draw for Eric off this stack size three to one stacked pot ratio I do not really see canapon getting away from this hand and oh my goodness not only does Eric turn the straight both players turn a club flush draw this is going to spell very bad news for canapong he's got seven outs to make a better flush than Eric nope not even he's got five because two of those outs would make a straight flush Eric just calling in position not giving any signs that he's got the best of it the seven you think could maybe save canapong but I think with how much money is already in the middle and how little is left behind this money is going to be going in kanapong with the shove Eric Matson with the call and that's gonna do it my friends Eric Matson wins that pot for 300 million chips and Eric Matson is our WSOP online Main Event Champion taking home 2.8 million dollars coming to this Final Table big stack Mr Eric Matson also one of

[Document(page_content="uh this Ace Queen off this is just a pretty good flop and one that we just are pretty much required to bet as the pre-flop aggressor I think that not betting it is more suspicious um this King on the turn we're just gonna go small probably just like small small if we get check raised I think that's a hand like Jack 10. I think Jack 10 would make a ton of sense here uh I don't think I have about three bets so basically I'm just gonna call Hope For like a deuce uh Jack not the greatest of cards because now we can have Ace Jack but if they have Jack 10 we should have less a shock in our range foreign small bet on the river a small bet on the river um yeah it's kind of a it's a bet that could be you know inducing versus a hand like king queen or something I don't know basically like we just raise and hope for the best obviously the best being uh I guess that I mean well it's a lot of excitement a lot of excitement for a little bit of nothing 10 off will defend um for some men actually think three ways uh I'm not going to fold but it's not like a slam dunk uh here after we flop it we're going to lead uh I don't love my sizing 70 I should have gone 50 percent could have gone 30 percent oh boy I want this one back the nine I don't think the nine is like a card I want to bet a ton villain's gonna have more nines and I um on the ace like do I just bet like 30 or 25 percent I guess 25 percent I think that like leading three ways they're 70 is just uh yeah it's a mistake should have been 50. typically aren't betting a more than 50 very often in multi-way pots and the Button had seven five of Spades uh this Ace nine um we're gonna flat on the button and now we have three-way flop just checking this I don't think it's a hand that needs much protection villains hands that can kind of improve like villains 10x uh their single pair type hands here I don't again I don't need a ton of protection I don't think I can get called uh two streets by 10x so just going to be checking behind and then playing Rivers accordingly uh the 10 is you know that's one of the cards that promotes villains um the fact that they don't bet kind of is yeah just gonna give me the I think I'm gonna go on the larger side here go a little bit more polarized try to get Bluff caught by some like pocket fours pocket fives type hands I'd be quite surprised to get raised on the river it's a hand it makes a lot of sense a river flush the villain had six four so they wow the villain had six four off which is oh no no I had six four off they had five six off so they Bluff caught there with third pair um that's a little bit of uh questionable hero call there with third pair um so facing a big bet on this board with my flush draw I'm going to call uh yeah just going to start by calling um I should have a fair amount of Queens in my range I don't know that yeah I don't know the villain bets the turn with less than a queen um so basically we're just gonna fold to a turn bet so Ace Queen off here just gonna be uh three bet pretty slam dunk facing a four bet we will call and going back to that five six offhand that villain just played um I think yeah that says something about their strategy about the way they play they like Bluff catching uh wide formation here flopping top here top kicker we are just going to be um we're just going to be basically going for it um three streets of value gonna be 2270 in the pot on the turn and we'll bet 70 percent Jax a set of jacks should be four betting so like Jack should be four betting the value they have is really pocket sevens this Jack on the turn is not Ultra great for us it obviously promotes their flop middle pairs um now I don't think our hand is strong enough to go for three streets of value and we have a flush completing card and a straight completing card I'm not Ultra concerned with the I'm not Ultra concerned with the flush completing aspect of it they will have some like King tints in their range and now they bet um hmm three-quarters pot here it's quite I just can't think of a hand that we beat yeah I think I'm just gonna fold I can't think of a hand that we beat um which is typically a bad sign when you're Bluff catching okay okay like once the cutoff opens and the button calls we get to call some of our pocket pairs in the small blind due to a lot in part of the low rake environment of these Stakes so here with the ace 8 with the eight of Hearts uh because we block the straight and villain three bets a lot of their sets of tens probably a lot of their sets of sevens we're just going to start out big very unexpected to get raised here I don't expect to get raised like very often at all the Rays is quite small we're getting three to one um I think I'm just going to fold when you bet those boards with an available straight and you choose a large sizing the frequency in which you get raised typically goes down which means that the hands that do decide to raise you are more Equity driven by Nature so they are stronger and when you're facing a range that is full of a bunch of strong hands you typically need a hand to continue that can either realize some Equity so a flush draw for instance it's like a slam dunk continue [Music] um yeah I think that's that those are the types of hands that can that can kind of improve I wouldn't even choose that sizing with a hand like an over pair right I think that like if I did choose that sizing with an over pair the problem is that you get you know you get uh raised and then life is kind of hell um here with the Queens yeah so we're just gonna be four betting this and getting it in it fill in jams then c'est la vie uh villain flatting for about pot I think that their Ace kings are going to get it in quite often so basically we're gonna go the old 25 actually that's I've seen better carts in the deck than that checking this card I actually don't think they're gonna bet this card that often I don't think they should anyway like we're checking a lot of our Ace Kings and here checking again um you would think that once villain calls the Flop they have Bluff catchers um man um so they have Aces full for sure uh man I think again they've got to be turning a hand into a bluff like jacks or tens with no heart and I just think that's quite unlikely I mean it's possible but quite unlikely so versus this villain like we're gonna open they seem to be pretty like they haven't taken a ton of aggressive actions so I don't think that like limping is gonna do us much good um this board they have a lot of natural continues they have a lot of natural continuous I don't know that they have a ton of hands that want to call versus three streets so we're just going to start out with 50 and go bet bet on a variety of runouts including this one now we have like an eight a queen a seven a six all viable cards to have to Bluff with bet suspicious of like the 7 8 Queen tens even 810 Maybe hands that raise the turn I mean like Jack nine sets makes some sense fives and Deuces nines they're likely to three bet pre guess they could have like a jack five-ish type hand turning two pair maybe Jack Deuce suited even um big blind versus MP like wow we'll call just because we'll call just because but uh queen queen nine like we block king queen um villain started out small like we're just gonna call anytime doing these live streams and have a fringe hand to complete the big blind with just want to give action give the audience what they desire it's not good blocking um King 10 and King Chuck which would be some available Bluffs half pot here kind of strange sizing um pretty good run out thin value that bet the turn Jax intends I don't think they go for three streets maybe they do versus a nine Aces and Kings sure do Ace Queen does available Bluffs would be there you go I guess Kings doesn't go for it either I think that off the table you just want to study and learn and grow as much as you can which looks different for different people but yeah that's that's kind of the process I mean once you have the skills and you're able to recognize that you have an edge then you want to move up if you can um here with the jacks I think okay we're gonna start out with the 70 percenter um I don't expect to get raised here that often we don't have the Jack of Spades but hence like um on the seven that doesn't really change very much and you know we're just going to be going for three streets of value here I don't expect to get raised like this will be a three bet happy day got a hand that can three bet and call a four bet um ace high we block Ace Queen um I think we're going to start out with half pot blocking like Ace King doesn't really do a ton because they don't really have Ace King um they can have like ace5 or ASA pocket a it's pocket fives it's like a pretty easy three bet and call Four bet hand this villain's short 24 hands at the table they've been through bet quite a bit already uh and this is you know kind of a good board and we're gonna start by betting a quarter pot don't really expect to get raised that often uh feelings tacit offend quite wide facing this bet so on the seven turn like now going three streets I don't think makes a lot of sense so I think like just checking makes some sense um the nine pairing not especially great the back door flush completing also not especially great um hope fill in checks basically there were quite a few different runouts that I would have preferred now it's just uh pretty much checking and quite the turn card for the villain there and we're just gonna defend like all the things here flopping top two on a board where villain just has a bunch of strong hands like really happy to just bet half pot and expect to get check raised quite often um I expect villain to continue quite often like it's just I would be quite shocked and surprised if villain just Chuck Folds um we're just gonna go for an overbed here on the turn again we have a limited amount of strong value hands and that just puts villains Bluff catchers in a quite a pickle but they got out of the pickle by simply mucking their hand the eights is going to be a three bets if nothing happens if the five seat of the four seat Flats then we could consider flatting but as it is we'll just go ahead and three but foreign check raising here with the dot flush blocker and just barreling off pretty much most runouts with that specific hand let's just hope the five seat doesn't open because I think I would I would deviate and simply flat the five seed and it's tough to invite the two seat in want the two seed to play the one seat there doesn't agree with me at all um pretty slammed up call here uh flush draw with overs I mean we could raise we don't have a lot of hands that want to raise but it doesn't really stop us from Raising um the king is quite good the king like villain can rep the king um here I don't know if this villain's gonna go bad check bad or not a lot of their hands that want to Bluff to turn just like Jackson tens and nines check their 8X checks they're Bluffs tend to bet so they probably have more Bluff catchers here than they have uh natural Bluffs one kind of interesting thing we could do is go a third and then call a raise foof we did it villain had the Jack eight of clubs so they flopped top pair I hope you all have enjoyed the stream um lost about 900 didn't really I couldn't really get much going um but we'll get them next time thank you all very much", metadata={'source': 'j1GYUhEKJ3I', 'title': 'How To CRUSH Online CASH Games [Poker Play & Explain 1000NL]', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 17548,

[Document(page_content="so this is from day one of the main events uh if you've never played this tournament it's a 50 000 chip starting stack and it has two hour levels it's really really special because you just you get to take your time and grind people down you don't really have to force it you know you might hear someone say don't Bluff it off on day one of the main event you'll really regret it something like that uh folds just on the button and we have the king said no super standard open uh just to discuss opening ranges if you are confident in your play and you have two weak players two unknown players in the blinds and you're on the button you should be opening 100 of hands because they're just not going to three bet you enough uh they're not going to defend their big one enough and then when they do defend they're not going to check crazy enough they're not going to Bluff you enough so in pretty much every aspect you're gonna get played back at as little as possible for the most part I would say that most of the time you know you might have an unknown player that's very aggressive but for the most part if you're playing especially in America people are passive I'm gonna go for a two and a half egg size which I think is the most appropriate I see regs going for a 2X when they're 100 big blinds effective I think that's a mistake you want more money in the pot when you're in a position so a big blind fence and we get this low paired board with a hard card and I go for a small bet that should be the only size that's used because we're just targeting Auto folds and he has so many hands that are air that just missed you know Queen I know and 10 eight of hearts and King three hearts so on and so forth and we get check raised to a really small size and we have two options here we can either continue by calling or we can through that on the flop to talk about his check raises he should be taking his best Jack X so his Ace Jack his King Jack Queen Jack can check race uh once he gets down to like say Jack eight it's getting kind of dicey so he's going to want to mostly check call and then of course trips he's going to want to check raise pretty much all his Forex with the exception of maybe you have like Ace of clubs four that's just you know blocking a lot of my continues and uh it's just such a strong hand uh and then some some Bluffs he's going to use the low Club draws so I had like deuce three of clubs uh five three clubs all these low combinations of flush shrubs are really good because they don't have showed on value he just gets to knock me out of the pot and he also has Equity when I continue and then there are some non-intuitive hands which are you know the three to a straight and three to a flush so Ace of clubs five Ace of clubs three five of clubs three uh six five of the club seven five to a club seven six of the club and then even like a high carb with Club so like KN clubs five could do it and and like I said pretty much any Ace of clubs you you could do it with because then if you you know you pick up a club on the turn you can continue barreling and and you're blocking folks so I I decided in game just to call and we get the best best turn we could possibly get and our opponent goes for around a 40 pot size and I started thinking to myself well how would I play my range on the turn if I had a full house or if I had a flush how would I want to play it well the the spr is not that deep heading to the reverse if I call it's only about three so it's going to be fairly easy to get Stacks in especially if he keeps betting so I don't think raising with my range makes a lot of sense and I don't think it makes sense with this hand either if I was to raise and then let's say he had a hand like five four and then he came over the top and shoved on me it would be a shame to fold the King of Clubs I could see a raise with like some type of weak Club being good so if we floated the Flop with six five with with a club and then raise the turn because we don't really care if we get pushed off our Equity there that would be good but I think we are going to just call here and then the other side of that is you know if I have pocket Jacks pocket aces uh a flush I would want to just call and let him keep bluffing um and then you know be able to evaluate on the river maybe the river double pairs the board and we have a flush and heat that's really big and then we just fold so I think we want to just play a call with most of our hands then we get the queen of hearts on the river and once again he goes for about this this 40 size so I don't think he has a super strong hand anymore um on the Flop and the turn I don't necessarily have any reason to think this guy doesn't have trips or this guy doesn't have a flush but once he goes to size on the river now I'm saying well if you had a four if you had maybe King 10 with a club for straight if you had a flush I think you're going to bet more around seven or eight k at least if not betting like 10K so I think this is going to be more of like an ace um some random Bluff it might be a jack you know that might it might sound crazy to think he's betting a jack with this line but you know when you're playing a tournament like the main event you might be playing with someone who plays twice a year so they don't have really much Rhyme or Reason to be betting they just you know maybe he has a Jack and he doesn't want to check the river and face with other services so with all that being said I think he's fairly capped I have the King of Clubs I you know I can't win by calling and I'm blocking a lot of strong hands so I kind of a fairly easy shelf here and he ended up tanking for about two three minutes and he let it go folded in Ace and of course we had to show him you know it was it was the end of the day so weren't too worried about uh and been paying us back with that information later but um this is actually my favorite hand from the entire tournament believe it or not all nine days that I played because I didn't really consider myself to be a great player at the time so I struggled a lot with getting the job uh the desired result a lot of my Bluffs were inefficient because I was either making a sizing error or my line didn't make sense whatever it may be so you know momentum and confidence is really important in tournaments so just getting this one through and ended up bagging around 175k to end day one so three and a half X starting from there I never really looked back but yeah early momentum very important go on to the next hand uh this is from day two once again at the end of the day so same kind of thing where I was uh I guess so the the hand prior I was playing with that player all day and then the player in question here I was also playing with him all day it was a younger gentleman and he was pretty aggressive he raises from under the gun one and I'm in the cut off with Ace Kingo and I decided to go for a three bet I have two options I could of course three bet here which has the Merit of knocking the blinds out and the players behind out of the pot and I get to you know play in position with a strong hand against a an aggressive opponent I could also just flat with the hopes of people squeezing behind and then I disguise my hand you know if it comes ace high perhaps he will be betting into me three times and we'll just be calling him down but I went with the aggressive option here and he ends up peeling so the Flop is 109 to use rainbow and I don't think this is especially good for impedition we do have the over pair Advantage so we're going to have Aces and Kings when he never does and we're also going to have Jackson Queens at some frequency but we don't really have sets ever so I'm never three Banning pocket twos and even nines and tens so in the tournament as as long and as good as the main event like I said earlier you can really take your time and pick your spot so let's just add through that nine through value and the guy at the four bit well I'm gonna have to peel and play the pot and now all of a sudden we're playing a four bit pot with nines so the same thing with tens we're not really going to be three betting that often so he has the nut Advantage by having more stronger hands in the sets um but we still are doing fine on this board we're still going to have a hand like Ace 9 suited we're gonna have h10o King 10 suited Queen Sun suited hands like that so I can either uh small bet or check and I went with a small bet and our opponent decides to call so just talk about reverse implied Ops let's just say he check erased us I would just let my hand go I think it would create be pretty disastrous you know if we get the king turn or the ace turn and then he keeps on bidding big well it's pretty likely that we're just dead he could have Queen Jack as a bluff on the Flop and then we turn a king and then we make top Harry he makes it straight uh he could just have a set we're drawing Stone dead and yeah I just think more bad comes than good so it's just important to let this hand go if we do at checkers uh turn is the Ace of Club so now we're feeling really good about our hand considering we faded the Checkers on the Flop and he checks to us and I think our size here it should be big we're not going to really be betting small ever if I had a hand like pocket tens or Aces that's when I would bet small as an exploit because I would just expect him to be folding too much in his range but considering our range here on the turn well if I have a hand like kings or Queens I'm not going to really want to bet for protection or you know just deep getting in general for Value because now it's it just seems too thin I think he's just gonna fold the 10 and he's going to continue a hand better than Kings so we would check a hand like you know kings queens queen-sensiti King test suited so when we bet the turn we're gonna go for a large size because we're saying we have an Acer better essentially so whenever you're considering your bet size you you want to think about well what hands am I betting if you know if I get to that a lot of my range then I get to go for a small size or a large size but if I'm only betting like really good hands that means I'm polar so that that means I'm going to go for larger sizes and um so he ends up calling and we got a Super Brick on The River and we only have about two-thirds pot to play for on the river so we just have a super easy shove it's really hard to be beat here there's only one combination that's a sport suited and Ace for our hearts um if he had tens nines or Deuces he's gonna check raise the flop at the high frequency and if not he's going to check raise and turn at some frequencies so those hands are super discounted the really the only way it would be is you know if you did still play a set or if you turn Aces and nines or Aces and twos and Aces and tens and he's just letting me Barrel off but considering I cover the guy and even if I you know if I run into it I'm still in the tournament I just have an easy show for value and he pretty much snap calls with Ace Jack which I don't think is like a mistake uh once you get here it's kind of tough to fold top pair right uh you know you're playing against someone who's capable of Bluffs and you get the best turn that you can possibly get but his problem was is fluffed yo so like for the same reason that I would fold to the check raise with my Ace cane because I'm you know I'm fearful of running into a strong hand when I turn an Acer King well he just turned the best possible turn you could get and he was dead right and I just get to Value that I'm down to the river and he has to call so he's just let it go on the Flop you know even if he turns a jack what if I have king queen what if I've jacked it to you what if I have over pairs that he's behind you know if he turns an ace I could have had aces Ace King Ace Den Etc so really important to just let this go on the Flop and not let your mistakes compound unfortunately it costs it in here this whole tournament all right moving ahead to day three so now we're about 1050 players remaining and right around a thousand a page so you know so many players left and and only 50 needing to drop you you could think that we're going to be inside of the money very shortly which is an important consideration in his hand under the gun one raises to 13k 2.6 x and I peel the cut off with sixes and I I guess I should mention he's also he was a recreational player and so my decision point is fairly simple you know I don't want a three-bit this hand ever I just want to keep it simple and play in position try to make a set or you know maybe get some low board where I can that if checked you and try to take it down now it folds to big blinds who has around 40 big bonds and this is Ryan Laplante I didn't know him at the time but he's a fairly well-known Pro and and he's also fairly aggressive and he decides to slide out 65k so considering that we're essentially on the money bubble and considering it's large size and given the situation what do you guys think Ryan's range is in the spot and if you want to take a guess then you can pause this video and take it over for a few seconds so Ryan's range in this exact spot is going to be Aces Kings and a bluff and nothing else because if he had a hand like queens or his King he's for sure just going to want to through that all in um if he has Ace King he doesn't want to squeeze even if he has Ace King suited he doesn't want to squeeze and then get peeled and then break out you know SBR is going to be super low um you know it comes 1085 he's just going to be unsure as to what's new same thing with Queens if he was just squeeze queens and get an Acer King High flop it's going to be really tricky for seating with a low SBR and you're out of position and you're right about to make money right so you wouldn't want to be in either of those scenario so you you would just want to head in the hand and call in pre-flop so that being said I think I have a really good spot to back shove on him because his range is really narrow so when someone's range is really narrow that opens them up to having way way too many Bluffs so I'm going to explain this from from two sides one is the mathematical side and the second is the The Human Side so let's first take a look at the math the question becomes how often does our back shift need to work in order to be good since we're risking you know a large portion of our stack and we're risking you know 182 to win less to 103. we only have 20 Equity to win the pot when we do get called then we better be right A lot of the time so I've prepared three scenarios we're going to talk a little bit about combinations so the first scenario is if Ryan was being balanced if Ryan was being careful and he he said you know what if I squeeze here and either player decides to be aggressive and thinks I'm full of it then I'm going to lose a lot of my chips so you know what I'm going to use Aces and Kings for Value that's 12 combinations because of the pairs are six combinations each and then he says I'm going to use ace5 suited and that's going to be in my single Bluff so suited hand there's four combinations there so we have a three to one ratio now value value to Bluffs right so 25 of the time we win the full pot which is 150 000 but 75 of the time we're only going to have 20 Equity so in that situation we lose 80 000 chips and so if you if you take those two numbers you know 100 000 that we win 25 of the time and then we're losing 101 000 75 percent of the time that results in a net loss of 10 big blinds on average so of course we're going to want to avoid that situation um you know if we're if we're doing it way too much then it's it's not going to be good for us by uh back shopping I mean so scenario C I mean scenario B is versus old man coffee you know the the tight guy who literally never has a bluff so of course we're going to want to avoid this right so very easy math here we're losing a ton we're losing 20 big blinds but you know this this goes not only through this spot but many spots so let's say you have a really good bluff catcher on the river but the guy that is betting into you never Bluffs well it might be as good as having two napkins right it doesn't matter how good your your blockers are or how good your bluff catcher is if your hand is a bluff catcher and the guy number Bluffs so same thing here right if if he only has Aces or Kings we better let our hand go now moving on to scenario C which I think is the most likely scenario and let me explain why so scenario C are guys really really out of line so here's just a couple pictures it's it's the same thing just wanted to show you a little bit about combinations so here's his value range he has his Aces and Kings right now we we added in some Bluffs so we have four combinations of some of these Asus we have a couple combinations of this canine suited and then what you'll see here at the bottom this is uh this is the combinations of the offs you can so like I said with off suit hands there's 12 combinations and this is Ace Jack that's highlighted um and so why is this important so if there's only six combinations of pairs which is his value and there's twice as many with his Bluffs which is awesome hands and it's like Ace nine Ace 10 K10 King Jack a shot Ace Queen it becomes extremely apparent how easy it is for this guy to just overdo it because when it folds to a human being in the spot and he looks down at Ace Jack then you know who's to say he doesn't squeeze every time because it looks strong right where where we want to win the pot like we're on the bubble of the main event and you know we make it 65k you know there's no way these guys aren't going to give me credit right well not necessarily true right because you know if we if in our shoes if we see how narrow his range is then we start thinking about his Bluffs okay what if you squeeze in King seven suit or what if he's squeezing A6 suited Ace two suited any of these hands you know his value range is just so small and his his bluff range can be so so wide that it becomes more and more problematic the more aggressive the player is all right so so that's the the math side of things and let's just talk about his his size and his timing so I know you guys weren't there but the manner in which he did it he took maybe 15 or 20 seconds and just casually slid out 65k and I just completely was not buying it like I just don't think if you have Aces you're gonna go 65k maybe Kings Kings makes more sense because you know of course any ASAP flop is bad for you and with Kings it's way different than Aces so that makes sense but even then like I just think he's gonna go something like 53k or 47k 50k or something like that so we're turning to the combinations uh now on the second picture this is the six combinations of his Aces well look at what we've done here we're now taking away four of his combinations of aces based on his sizing so I just don't buy it right so I'm taking away four combos of his Aces he's down to eight combos of value and I say you know what now I'm going to take a couple combinations of Kingsway as well because again I just don't think you have it so where does that leave us it leaves us with him having six combinations of value and 45 combinations of Bluffs so you can't you can't see it here this is just what I came up with you know it's a hypothetical scenario of course but this is just one scenario it could be 30 combinations of Bluffs and he'd still be way overdoing it it could be 50 or 60 or maybe 70 combinations if if you squeezing like all these off suit Aces and suited Aces and other hands that I uh mentioned but in this exact scenario of him having six to 45 well now we're making 17 big blinds and that is amazing right so in game we you know thankfully we back shoved and uh he folded he he showed a three he ended up having Ace through Suited and it's a great result but you know if if we do run into it considering everything we shouldn't feel bad about you know seeing Kings because we just have to go with our read and you know I I don't think that I just want to mention that I wasn't counting combinations and game I wasn't saying oh he only has eight combinations of Bluffs or six combinations and he has like 50. I just didn't think he had it but I just wanted to show you guys the the math side of things because it you know it goes to show that if we're playing against someone we know his balance we have to be careful but you know whenever you're in a scenario if someone let's say you're playing with some European guy or some really aggressive Spaniard who are squeezing every hand you know you're calling an open and then the sky just squeezes every every time behind well it could become a really good spot to back shove on them because if they're getting really out of line you know they're they're seeing you not playing back at them or they're seeing the whole table is pretty passive then at some point you have to make a stand against certain players and it can end up being really really good um so you know if if you want to say ignore all the math it's completely fine you know just just have confidence and you know is this guy getting out of line do I think this guy doesn't have it because you know you can just back raise on from there start four betting him start uh three betting it more when he's when he's opening a lot so uh the the last thing last consideration is what if like I said what if you want 47 or 50k I would have just mocked you know like I even if I think he's getting out of line it's too much like his his sizing if he went 50k it's just so much more indicative of a really strong hand than than of a bluff heavy range so at that point I would just let it go but just the specifics you know he kind of you know gives it away then we're gonna go for it all right moving on uh this is a few hands later we're in inside the next level now and we're maybe 20 25 players off and uh LoJack raises some really aggressive french guy and we have the dream we have the aces on the button and we go 43k which is fairly large um normally I'd probably go like I don't know 39K 40K I guess it's not that large but I I just wanted to size up just a little bit to give the guy the idea that I was bluffing and he had been playing with me he he knew I was aggressive and since we're on the bubble I I expected him to play back in me quite a bit and this is exactly what happens he comes in for four bet of 125k it was pretty large um and now we have this this dilemma it's it's a good dilemma nonetheless but at the time I was thinking you know should I shove and maybe stack a hem like Queens make sure I I stack like Ace King or double up I guess because he covers me but on the other side of the coin is his Bluffs like if he's bluffing then we really would want him to blast off to us and you know considering we just talked about combinations for so long it's this is another spot where it's really really easy to get out of line so I thought the the best play is for sure just to call and you know if we do end up getting out flopped or if he has like pocket kings and we got a king High floppel we're just gonna have to have to give him the money um so he comes in for a small C bet which I think is good there's no reason it's really that large in the scenario and once again you know I don't want him to fold out his hands if he's bluffing so I just want to call and turn his attend and he just puts us all in and if we're beat would be you know we're gonna we're gonna have to Bubble the main event if we have to that's gonna suck after three full days of playing but it is with this and we end up calling and the guy is 6'40 so thankfully we know we faded the ten percent heading to the river but um you know again to talk about a spot where it's really easy to overdo it this guy's putting max pressure on us on the bubble when you know in actuality I'm not really in a three bedroom as a bluff to us just it just has an adjustment I'm going to make because I'm aware that he's aggressive he's aware that um that I'm aggressive so you know even if I had like I think if I had a hand like Queens here or Ace Queen pocket Jacks Pockets ends I might flat like every single time just to try to play a smaller pot because you know like let's say we have Queens in this exact spot well I think we're probably gonna have folding the turn it's just a little too dicey so I I think flattings hands make sense and playing a very value happy approach to three betting maybe like Ace gang suited Kings and Aces and then some Bluffs on this this spot make sense considering the bubble and considering the guys playing back at us was 6-4-0 um so yeah just don't do this like you just have so many better hands you can use a suited Ace you can use a shooting king or you know at least two high cards when you have a six and a four you're like what are you trying to do you're not blocking me from having any value you have really poor playability post flop so it was just completely out of line and thankfully that uh propelled us forward all right so now we are jumping ahead once again to day five I didn't have really too many interesting hands on day four and it was it was so long ago it was four years ago so I didn't want to mess up any details but anyways so you might notice we're now we're 10-handed in this uh in this replayer whereas on the other hands it wasn't like that and and the reason that I have it 10-handed is is I make this peel with threes and I just want to State the fact that in theory this is clearly a mistake because for a couple of reasons so if players are playing correctly behind they're going to be squeezing uh most of their range so let's say the LoJack has content suited um pocket jacks or Ace quinoa like you should squeeze most of the time but what happens in these live tournaments is people just call so I get to see the flop for cheaper on average and I also get to realize My Equity more so just like in that first hand where I was saying you know you should raise every hand on the button because you're not going to get played back at enough well you get to peel hands that you really shouldn't like I would also appeal like you know pocket twos and base two suits and ace5 suited and in the hopes of making a really strong hand and winning a big thought because we're everyone folds around to the big blind and calls we end up flopping bottom set um a board that hits the opener White's heart a lot of his offset stuff like Ace queeno and uh canquino connects and then he's gonna have of course um over Paris and uh 10x and Club draws King Jack Ace King Ace Jack Etc checks to him and he bets are on the third part and now I have to decide between a call and a race and I think arrays is by far the superior play uh you would just hate to Flat here and you know maybe you hope the big blind comes along or maybe hope that he raises it's just not going to happen and often there's so many turns that just kill the action uh let's just say he had kings in the terms of ace of clubs or the turns any club well now we're going to win a sway smaller pot when maybe we would just win it all if we race right away so it's it's really important to fast play in the scenario and also it's um some hidden benefit of when we race here the big blind has to play really tight so we don't mind him folding the King five clubs we don't mind him folding Jack nine or uh King nine or the club or King Jack because he's only gonna really put more money in the pot when he improves and that beats us with the exception of them maybe making a pair and giving us some money anyways uh he he ended up calling and then we got a super clean turn and we go for around 60 on turn uh just going to want to try to play for Stacks uh don't want to Betsy small you know if he does have a fairly we can and he would have called a small bed and folded to a large bed and then still be it we're just going to try to stack the top of his range here and not give him a good price if he does have does have a good draw like uh the nut flush draw or some type of combo draw and he comes over the top and we have a super easy call once again you know if if he has queens or tens somehow then we're just going to give him the money and he ends up having king queen and we have 100 Equity heading into the river which is you know the absolute dream for this size of the pot um so I just want to talk a little bit about his decision points with his exact hand and yeah I don't think it's necessarily a mistake to be betting on the Flop but that being said I don't think he should just Auto keep out his hand because is not going to really be able to get through streets of value from either player all the time uh like I mentioned earlier there's just certain turns that kill the action on the turn or slow him down it could be an ace or a club or maybe a 10 and he's worried about someone making trips so he could start with a check and just check to call and keep this pot smaller maybe hope that I'm that I'm bluffing and if it does check through he's still going to be able to Value bet if the turn is a blank and you know checks them he can be thoroughly confident he has the best hand of vast majority of the time so again it's it's not necessarily a mistake it's just it's it's a good consideration to just check here and then the second thing which is an even larger mistake is he decides to check Jam to turn with just a good top pair when in reality I I can't name a hand that I'm back calling that's worse than has if I had Queen Jack I'm not going to raise the Flop and then about to turn that'll be way too thin um the absolute weakest hand I would do this with is is uh Ace Queen and and even then I wouldn't do that at a full frequency um so like I guess what he was hoping for is I had some type of draw and he's denying Equity but um yeah I just I think it's a really big mistake when when you're shoving a hand for Value that can't get called by worse and I mean it's really unlikely that I have a draw anyways because let's say I have King Jacker clubs and then I raise the Flop and then I get this brick turn I'm probably just going to check the turn I don't want to get jammed on like you did and have to call it off or have to fold with so much Equity so I think this is a pretty big error on his part and I remember like just the the ace coming on the river and I immediately thought of that I was like if he called and he probably would have just gotten away from it on the river so yeah just just be try to make sure to not uh make the easy decision by you know shoving and ending ending the hand when you can't really get called by worse I think that's going to wrap it up for today and in terms of the hands so I I hope this was helpful I hope that it's going to be applicable for you guys to to use some of these Concepts in game and um if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask or any comments and I would greatly appreciate it and and thank you so much for spending the time to watch this video cheers", metadata={'source': 'dFzEQMYcOjk', 'title': 'How To Run DEEP In

[Document(page_content="what's up guys Evan Jarvis here for pokercoaching.com and today I'm going to teach you how to maximize your profits for every online poker session through the power of positioning yourself for maximum profit this is a little secret that the pros and online poker Pros know and today I am going to share it with you let's get stacking how to maximize your profits for every online poker session the key when it comes to maximizing your profits for every online poker session is putting yourself in the best position to profit all things being equal if you have the option of sitting in a tough game versus sitting in an easy game your expected value your expected earn your expected hourly rate is going to be higher in the easier game without you making any different decisions on the felt you can come armed with the most fantastic strategy and your earn is largely going to come down to the quality of play of your opponents so putting yourself in the best position of profit is going to make your life a lot easier and going to put a lot more money in your pocket this is accomplished by selecting the best tables and then selecting the best seat on those tables in this video I'm going to show you exactly how to do that then once you've got the best seat and you're on the best tables then you apply your winning strategy repeatedly and watch the money roll in so let's take a little look at how the money is distributed in a typical poker game this image is provided from my new book mastering small Stakes cash games which is available on Amazon and Audible so in a typical game we have the spot it's going to be the donator it's going to be the fun player it's going to be the person who is the game is built around and is you know providing money for the game to run by being a losing player and these numbers aren't exact but the idea here is the essential thing is that let's say this spot is going to lose their money 100 of their money minus a hundred who's gonna pick up that money well typically the player who has direct position on them the person who is on their direct left is going to get the most share the majority of that money so I assume it's around about 40 percent of the 100 is going to be lost it's going to go to this person on the left who is in what's known as the Jesus seat we call it the Jesus seat because when you have direct position on the spot you're basically playing on God mode or you know playing with the game genie to the left of the Jesus seat that player is expected to get more like about 30 percent of the spot's money so still a significant amount but less than the player who has direct position you move one over you're looking at about 20 percent of the dead money and finally when you get three spots over you're gonna get about 10 percent again these numbers aren't exact but it's the concept That's essential once you get farther away where you're across the table from the spot you don't really expect to get that much of the spot's money because the players who have direct position are going to be three betting they're going to be isolating they're going to make it difficult and expensive for you to get in in pots with the spot and therefore the farther away you are the more players who have the opportunity to isolate before you enter the pot the less likely you are to be able to see spots flops with the spot and get a share of the spot's money and then once you get to the right of the spot it's you almost don't want to be in the game if there's only one spot and you're on their direct right cool so now that you kind of understand how the money is distributed and why it's really important to get the best seats on the tables that have the spots let's look at how to find the best table so you can identify the games that are going to have a lot of dead money up for grabs anyway because that dead money ideally is going to help your bottom line a ton so here I have the typical Lobby this one's from PokerStars Ontario you can see we have the table name the stakes the game type of game which is six max number of players wait list average pop players for flop enhanced per hour so key factors to select the best table number one you want to look at the players per flop percentage this is in the column second from the right and the higher this is the better why well players per flop percentage represents what percentage of players are seeing the Flop this basically corresponds to the player's vpip in the game the higher the players per flop percentages the more likely you're going to have someone in the game who has a high VP 40 50 70 or that dream scenario someone who has a 100 vpip this is a very essential number when going through game selection it is kind of one of the most telling things if you have no additional information the second thing you look at is the average pot size the higher this is the better but this is less reliable than players per flop why well this is based on a smaller sample of hands if I'm not mistaken and if there have been a couple of all-ins or a couple of big pots that can skew this number to the higher side the time that this is extremely valuable is when this is very high because there's someone who's going all in blind and getting action and you're going to see a number that's just absolutely insane because almost every pots and all in pot likewise you'll sometimes see this number being very large because someone's doing oversized raises or you have someone who will call any size raise or just someone who's playing overly loose and overly splashy number three of the key factors is who is in the game now this is one that requires some work beforehand but it's some work that will pay dividends later and I'll show you on the next slide or a couple slides from now uh what that looks like and how it pays off but basically if you label the players on the table whether you're in the game or just observing then when you're going through the lobby you can see a preview of the table and it'll show you the colors of the players you have labeled my case if I see a baby blue or purple I want to get on that game whereas if I see a lot of the regular colors of green yellow red then I know it's just a reg Fest and not a game that's going to be at the top of my list if I'm choosing to say play four tables here because I would want to pick the best four finally we have the length of the wait list which can be a tell especially if it's very long because typically if there's a long wait list for a game there's a reason that people are choosing to line up for that game over another game the downside to this is if the waitlist is very long that probably by the time you get there the player that the game was built around will already be gone so it'll give you some information may be good for doing your labeling for you know future game selection and it's always worth putting your name on the list but often if that wait list is five six people the game is going to be no good by the time you get there okay so let's continue on how to select the best table this is information for when you don't have players labeled and you don't have any previous information but you want to kind of try to find some spots these are the in-game tells the best one best one hands down is stack size if you see someone who's playing with less than 100 big blinds they're probably going to be a recreational player often the players who have less than 100 big blinds are playing with all the money in their account on that table bot bankroll on table not practicing good game selection probably not going to be practicing great hand selection and is definitely there to gamble uh two number of tables someone is playing someone is only playing one game more likely to be a recreational unless they're on a wait list for another game uh and likewise if someone is playing four games six games eight games it's pretty clear that they are a pro uh whether they're going to be a very tough Pro or they're going to be a rewards grinder a rakeback grinder you know they're less likely to give action than someone who's one tabling so that's a big tell right there third is the screen name and if you find lazy names that are just kind of numbers uh birth dates ones that have an X at the beginning or a zed or an underscore X at the end these tend to be recreational names and the reason why is because let's say you wanted to make your name Poker Pro and poker Pro was taken the site May then suggest hey poker Pros taken but why don't you make your name Poker Pro underscore X or poker Pro 69 and if I'm an impatient player and I just want to set up my account so I can get on the tables gamble I'm gonna say cool give me the name I don't care what the name is I just want to play and whereas a reg who's gonna have more patience is going to say oh poker Pro's taken well I want to come up with a thoughtful screen name because I know I'm going to have this screen name forever you only get one on the site I'm going to put more thought into it so it gives a clear tell as to someone's level of patience versus someone's level of impulsivity which is also going to carry over to the poker game now number three is the least reliable because oftentimes the regs know about this tell it's been a no-tell for a long time and so they might make fake names that make them look like recreational when really they're a reg but by focusing on the more reliable tells and combining them you can tell who's an actor and who's the real thing if someone has a recce screen name but they're playing four tables they're probably irregular right and if someone has a recreational screen name um but they're and they're playing with 52.4 big blinds probably a recreational so you can kind of combine the three tells to suss out who's a rag and who's a recreational stack size is the most telling number of tables they're playing is the second most telling and screen name is the third one cool so let's look at a specific table and how we would go about selecting the best seat uh ideally a little note here loose aggressive players you prefer to have them on your right and tight place of players you'd prefer to have them on your left a little bit more about this as we get further in uh so take a look at the table see the players that we have labeled who's the reg who's the wreck who's got less than 100 big blinds who has a name with some numbers in their name and who's got the recreational label who has a hundred big blinds who has a well thought out name who has the reg label right so you kind of put the piece together and So based on this information which is the best seat the one here that has direct position on the recreational player what seats that the Jesus seat if we're here we have direct position on the wreck we're expecting to get about 40 percent of that dead money whereas if we went over here well at first we'd expect he's got 40. he's got 30 we'd have 20 but if someone else sits in the game here now it's 40 30 20 10 we're expecting only a small amount of the dead money so we would take the seat with direct position on beginner um given the opportunity now if there are no recreationals on the table then the best seat is the one with position on the loose aggressive players because you want to be to the left of those players so that for the guys who are playing a lot of pots you can have position on them if players are very loose and they're on your left you're going to find yourself out of position very often which is much harder to play than being in position whereas tight players aren't going to enter as many pots therefore you'll find yourself out of position less frequently versus them when they're on your left now if you're taking a shot you might consider not taking direct position on the recreationals because the regs may put a lot of pressure on you three betting you a lot squeezing you a lot called for betting you a lot because they know you're taking a shot they know you're going to be out of your comfort zone so they're going to put you to the test when they think you're trying to isolate the recreational player with a wider range in that case you may actually want to take the seat on the left of the regs and let them have the Jesus seat because in that case you'll find yourself playing more pots in position versus these regs rather than out of position versus them and if they're doing a lot of flatting versus the recreational player and a lot of three betting versus the recreational player then you can have the option to play a tighter game and be more selective getting involved with good hands in spots that will pretty much always be big pots so the typical best seat to take when you're seen as the best player in the game or one of the players who the regs aren't going to go after you in pots and put you in tough spots which is ideally the type of player you want to be in the games you sit in as you study your poker coaching material uh is the one with direct position on the spot that Jesus seat directs to your left if however you are in a tough lineup when you're shot taking or uncomfortable with the stakes which is going to happen sometimes you know you're going to want to get in some games that are tougher because you want to push yourself test yourself improve your game in that case sometimes you want to sit to the left of the regulars and let them have position on the spot this is especially useful when some of the regulars get pretty maniacal or when you have an extremely loose player who wants to isolate the spot a lot because then the pots will always be very inflated before the action comes to you and you can just play a really solid style it doesn't mean you get to play as many hands doesn't mean you get to be involved in the action as much but it does mean that when you do get involved you're probably gonna have the best of it and the pot is going to be very inflated okay so the more familiar you are with the player pool the better decisions your your decisions will be about where to sit this is the most valuable thing the more time you invest getting to know the players picking up stats labeling players making reads you're gonna know who the spots are and if you know who the biggest donators are in a lineup or on the poker site or at the location that's going to Trump everything else because you know when that player is in the game you need to get in the game I used to play on a smaller site that had a couple of Players whose vpip were a hundred remember agents Jew was the best man he was VIP was 100. we had another player called Queen desert who had a v-pip of about 88 and would only Min raise and if you potted it they would Min raise you back and so you always knew you could see the flop for cheap and they typically would keep raising post flop and you could get a lot of action post Swap and have high implied odds so whenever that player was in the game needed to get on that game didn't matter what the players per flop was I knew those were the spots we'd always try to get in that game and the more you know your players the more you'll know when it's just a must get into game even if you can't get you know the Jesus seat or anywhere close to it sometimes a player is just splashy enough that having any seat on the table is good enough now without additional information when finding the best table online look for high players per flop percentage High average pot and sub 100 big blind Stacks nothing stopping you from opening the tables taking a look at them I like to open you know Six Tables tile them look for players label the obvious wrecks so that I have more information for next time always pays dividends uh when you are choosing your seat if you have a choice in seats getting direct position on the spot is ideal picking up that Jesus seat and the more spots on a table the more those recreational players the more sub 100 big blind Stacks High vpip players the better position on all of them is best in a perfect world you have three of them lined up and you get positioned right after them that's ideal but we take what we can get worst case if you get on a good game but you can't get a good seat you can always move seats once you sit so don't worry about always being perfect it's better to be on a good table in a bad seat than to not be on a table at all and the one thing to consider when you're deciding if you want to try to move seats is if there's a lot of volume on the site if the wait list is long it's not worth getting up off the table because your seat is going to get taken if it's a time in the day or in the evening where there aren't a lot of players online and there are no people on the wait list then if a seat opens up that has better position you can consider leaving the table to reseat for the better position but always check if there's a wait list before you do that move because it is a bit of a gamble it is a bit of a Gambit and sometimes in doing so you can see your seat get scooped up and now you're sitting on the sidelines on the rail waiting to get back on that table remember it's better to have a sub-optimal seat in a good game than to wait for the perfect seat and end up in no game at all and likewise when you're starting your session it's better to get for me I would rather wait to get on good games to start my session I'd rather take 10 minutes doing game selection than just fire it up but for some people they prefer to get in the rhythm of playing so it's better to get on a couple tables if you can while you're going through game selection uh the one thing I think is important to mention is that just jumping on all the games that are available and not wait list in anything and not kind of organizing your tables and decide how many tables you want to play before is going to cost you in the long run because you won't be maximizing your expected value by just optimizing your table setup number of tables best tables and best positions anyway that's all I have to say on that topic for today I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you learned a thing or two if you did please hit that like button to let me

[Document(page_content="hey everyone this is Lexi Gavin with pokercoaching.com and today I'm going to talk to you about pre-flop hand ranges for No Limit cash games so let's jump right into the PowerPoint so important factors to consider our position components stack sizes implied odds and reverse implied odds and the table dynamic so having position is advantageous raising early will force you to play out of position most of the time so the earlier you open the less likely it is that you will act last post-wop so the earlier you open the stronger your hand should be by having the ability to act last you can gain more information by seeing what people are doing before you and having the ability to check back in pot control post swap position really is everything and you don't want to play weekends out of position think in terms of your perceived range when opening in different positions so when you open a hand you're telling a story so when you're playing post swap always make sure that your your story makes sense know that when you open a middle position and you check the Jack 10 4 turn Ace and delay see bet and bet the turn your opponent will know that you likely won't have king queen because you didn't choose a continuation bet so that's what I mean about making sure your stories it tell makes sense um and always think about your perceived range don't be tempted to play hands that have reverse implied odds uh so we're going to talk about what implied odds and reverse implied ours odds are later in the presentation so here are some of your raised first in ranges here's your button range and I also added your under the gun range I wanted to compare the two because these ranges have the most contrast so as for the button this is the best position to have you get to At Last therefore you can open the widest range so you're going to be opening roughly 56 of the hands on the button when it's folded to you so the Open Range the open raises are shown here in blue and the wipes are full so as for under the gun this is your tightest range when you open under the gun you are often going to be out of position which makes it more difficult to play post-wop We're raising most suited Aces um and FYI A7 and A6 are the worst Aces to have because you can't make straights with them so that's why we didn't include those but we did include include ace5 and ace4 so hands like king queen off is on the fence uh but we did include it here it's a marginal open so as a general rule make sure make your decision to open this hand based on your opponents at the table if your table is really tough and full of good players uh you're just going to want to fold this pre-flop king queen off can't really defend to a three bet in this position so if you're at a passive table you can play it but uh looser aggressive tables you're probably just going to want to throw this away so under the gun plus one and under the gun plus two so for utg plus one uh we added in a rough roughly another three percent we've included all suited Aces now added hands like a strap off which is like what I was saying about the king queen off under the gun um only play this if your table is on the softer side under the gun too we're adding in roughly another three percent so now we're opening 17 of hands we're opening all pairs more um more pseudo connectors with some high suited double gappers like King Nine is King Nine Suited so middle position we're now at roughly 19 I added hands like Queen jack off again this is a bit loose so only play it if your table allows for it and the low Jack uh we're now opening around 21 of hands adding in hands like Jack eight suited 10 8 suited six five suited and up in the hijack here we're opening roughly 25 percent of hands as you can see we're loosening up quite a bit with hands like teammates suited and up um I added jacket suited but not Queen eight suited because jacket suited you have more straight possibilities we added suited gappers like eight six suited and up in the cut off we're now opening roughly 30 of hands a little less um here your opens will start to depend on who the blind who are in the blinds so if you have aggressive players in the blinds you may want to fold hands like four three suited or King seven suited if there are weaker players in the blinds you can never you you can even widen this up this range up a little bit and I don't want you guys to worry about memorizing this this is these are just general guidelines um some people have tighter ranges some people have looser ranges I think that mine is a little bit more on the looser side so if you're just new to Poker and just starting out um you may want to tighten this up just a bit small blind so small blind strategy is one of the trickier spots in poker some players recommend limping a wide portion of your range the big blind is often incentivized to raise versus limp so we want to balance our range and add some limp calls or limp re-raises with some strong hands so in blue I have your raises at roughly 19 percent the hands in red are your calls um not necessarily your your calls folds um these could be calls phrases um yeah you get the point um so you should always be aware of who is in the big one if the big line is a fish you can complete the small blind more so they come along into the pot and you can outplay them post-flop against weaker players you don't have to worry about balance as much but good players will always be watching what you're doing so if the big blind is more solid you should try and mix up mix it up more to keep them guessing and keep them on their toes so mix in some limp calls limp erases lymph shoves and open raises and open trouts if you are raising from the small blind I recommend choosing a bet sizing of minimum three x to 4X the big line you always want to go a little bit bigger uh blind versus blind because you don't want to give them a good price to you don't want to give them a good price plus position so now let's talk about opponents have the weaker players folded already so it's important to know what type of players there are so left to act when opening a pot if a marginal hand if a hand is a marginal open but the three best players are to your left you should lean towards folding more on the other hand if you have a weakish hand say in the cut off and the blinds are fishy you should lean towards raising you always want to try and play pods first weaker players especially if you have positions so always try and lure them into the pot how aggressive are the players behind do they have a balanced three-bit range so if the players behind you are strong you should always know whether or not your hand can defend versus three bet and what your strategy should be if you're under the gun and you're at an aggressive table uh with a lot of three bets you may want to avoid opening small pocket Pairs and those Ace jack off types of fans and if you're planning on opening verse a three bet heavy table definitely mix in some Bella some balance floor bets I'm going to be doing a presentation within the next few months on four bets good candidates for these hands would be hands with good removal like Ace nine suited and king queen off so now you want to think about again we talked about this but what types of players are in the blinds so again it's always important to look at who are in the blinds it's more pertinent when you're opening from late position some players way under under defend their blinds where others over defend um and by that I just means some players are not calling enough and some people are over calling so first let's talk about the big blind your range is going to open up a lot in the cutoff in the button if the big one is either type of extreme if they under defend you're just gonna print money by them folding their blinds and it adds up over time you'd be surprised others tend to call way too wide because they hate the idea of forfeiting their big one that they've invested already so they're going to have way way more junk than normal and way more junk than they should and you'll be able to play position against them so if the bit line is an unknown or defending a proper range then you can stick to the charts as a general guideline if you're in late position say the cutoff or the big blind and you're on the fence about and open you'll want to see what type of players in the small blind as well again some people have a three bet or fold only strategy from the small blind so if you have for example him like King do suited on the button and you know that the small blind has a three better fold only strategy king deuce should could be a hand that you open because a your king blocks a decent chunk of their three bet range and be if you do get three bed it's a decent hand to four bit Bluff because of you have removal with the king so these are just some things to consider when you're thinking about how to play your resource in range versus the small blend so more on opponents um adjust your range based on the table Dynamic so you don't only want to think about your opponents as individuals but how the table is playing as a whole what ask yourself what is the game Flow been like if it's an aggressive table you should tighten up if the table is super passive then you should be opening a lot of hands is it a fun loose friendly table are the majority of players drinking alcohol uh these can be some things to take into consideration um as well are any of my opponents tilted so if so figure out a way to adjust to that there are different types of tilt uh some players tilt by playing too many hands never folding the three bets try and get their chips in the middle as fast as possible against these players you should tighten up until you have a hand and when you do have a hand you should be bombing it size-wise if you're at a table with tilted or weak layers you want to try and isolate them or invite them into the pot so you can outplay them post-wide other players tilt because they feel like no matter what they do they are always getting beat you ever get that feeling like you just feel like you can't win a hand every time you have a hand someone's got you out kicked or something like that so these players have a tendency to overfold their hands so you can exploit this by opening wider and see budding more versam sometimes even the best players have a bad day and it can affect how they play at the table so picking up on this is very important because you want to have a dynamic playstyle that can adapt to this properly and capitalize on the opportunity how do my opponents perceive me um is also something you want to consider so always be cognizant of how your points opponents perceive you if you if you think your opponents view you as a knit then you can get away with widening your pre-flop opening ranges a bit uh we all go through Spurs of being dealt premium hands so we're constantly opening Pots if this is the case your opponents are probably seeing you as opening very wide in which case you might have to tighten up a bit pretty flop I've noticed that people will label you based on how you've been playing the last hour or so so it doesn't matter if you've been at a table where you've been card dead for four hours if that last hour you've been blasting and opening a lot and just making hands uh they're probably going to be labeling you as an aggressive opener so take that into consideration and don't forget your opponents will be able to see if you're tilted so if that's the case take a deep breath and get your game back to equilibrium every situation is unique because no two poker players play exactly the same so it's your job to try and figure out what type of player you're playing against and how you how you can adjust your strategy to exploit them so now let's talk about stack sizes how do these stack sizes affect my range and then we're going to compare deep stock to shallow stack play so uh so I sent this play a big role in determining your range in general the smaller your stack size the less playability you have if you're shallow stats you can't afford to play a street or two post Swap and loose and opening hands that you can't defend versus three bet is an easy way to bleed chicks when you're raising off a short staff you're putting a large percentage of your stuff in the pot so this creates a low stack to pot Ratio or spr with the what the cool kids are saying when you have a low spr you are more committed to the plot so always think in terms of spr when there are short stacks at your table um you're gonna have a you're gonna have to play for Stacks with overs if the effective specs are small I did a presentation on spr and over pairs so that should be out by now so go back in and watch that if you want to learn more about how to calculate your spr so say you're opening friendly position and the players behind you have effective stacks of 10 Bitcoins and under you can't really raise fold in this type of situation because you'll be getting too good of a price to call if you get shoved on so you want to adjust your range in these spots if you can't call a three-bit shove you should probably just fold pre-flop or adjust your strategy to where you are opening your open shoving of balanced range there are many push-fold game theory optimal charts you should study for these types of situations and when you're deeper stacked uh you you have the luxury to play a wider range because you have greater implied odds the Deep the deeper stock you are the more playability you have so you can get away with more while be being able to create a higher stack of pot ratio when you're deeper you can size up your bets a bit because it's unlikely that say with 200 Big wines effective that you're gonna get your entire your opponent's entire stack in a non-free bet pot so sizing up helps create smaller stack to pop ratios this is also why you can play more hands in a three bet pot when you're deeper stacked if your opponent has like pocket aces and you have pocket fives on the deuce deuce 5 board they're gonna have a hard time folding their pocket faces uh even for 200 big ones if you if you play it fast so now we're going to talk about the differences with cash and tournaments so in tournaments chip preservation is super important because tournaments are more about survival so the number of big blinds you have determines if you can afford to open or not so as the as a tournament progresses and more and more people are being knocked out your chip EV increases so your chips are worth more money than when you first started the tournament so your opening ranges are going to be quite different in tournaments than in cash games you need to fight for pots more in tournaments because there's already so much dead money in the Middle with the blinds and aunties you can't just wait for Aces every hand um so you're going to be opening a wider range once the blinds and nannies have kicked in pretty ante Rangers are going to be very similar to cash game uh opening raises because in the early stages of the tournament you're often 100 big blinds are more effective so in the early stages um of a tournament or if you're playing a cash game a hand like King 9 suited could be a fold under the gun whereas in a tournament with 40 bigs with aunties in play you can consider opening now let's talk about implied odds implied odds how much you expect to win after you complete your draw so this means that you have an opportunity to make money off your opponent if you make some kind of nut combination so let's look at an example so you raise under the gun to 3x the big blind with pocket sevens with a 200 Big line effective step the player to your left three bets to 10x the big one your opponent is representing the strong hand like a high pocket pair or a strong suited Broadway if stats are 100 big lines or less effective this would be an easy fold but since stats are 200 Big lines effective your implied odds to sap your opponent are high if you flop a set so when the board runs out eight do seven and you have pocket sevens they're gonna have a hard time folding their pocket aces or things um so when you're deep you can make these types of pre-flop calls now let's talk about reverse implied odds so this refers to how much you can expect to lose after you make your hand so when you complete your draw you still lose frequently because your opponent has a better hand so one example would be a weak ace high if you hit if you hit a pair of Aces with a very weak kicker the times your opponent has you out kicked are going to be costly low cited cards if you hit a low flush when your opponent has a higher flush it will be hard not to pay them off example three King jack off and King 10 off these are hands with reverse implied odds if your opponent opens an early position and the board is King High they'll also often have you out kick so you basically want to try and avoid opening reverse implied odds hands from early position because their flattening ranges will generally be strong on average when you open early um and while your jackpin suited looks pretty nice under the gun you're gonna run into way too many awkward spots with over pairs on the board as well as running into kicker problems when you do hit your pair so to sum up always factor in position when thinking about a hand consider your opponents consider stack sizes think about the table dynamic and every hand of Poker starts pre-flop and it's important to understand basic race first raise first inner hinges and fundamentals so every spot in poker is essentially an ongoing puzzle with unique situations presented and it's really up to you to properly adapt having guidelines is a helpful starting place but a lot of your poker intuition comes over time with practice study and volume so I thought we would do a quiz together um so I'm just gonna list a whole bunch of multiple choice questions with their answers and I'm gonna give you a moment to think about it and then we can you can choose your answer and then I'll I'll explain to you why that is the best answer so question number one what is the most important factor when deciding to play a pot position stack size players left to act table dynamic or all of the above so I'll give you guys a minute to think about this so the answer is e all of the above um it's you have to consider all of these options as we discussed in this presentation and I know that it could be overwhelming to think about so many different things when you're playing a hand and it can seem overwhelming but over time these things are going to just become second nature and and your decisions are gonna happen really quickly and easily and they'll start to come more natural with practice so question number two why is our UTD range the tightest a there are many players left to act B you don't want to play out of position with marginal hands see you only have position on the blinds D you have the least amount of information e all of the above or F none of the above so the answer is e um all of the above your utg ranges are just the tightest like I said over and over you just want to play really really tight at a position in an early position there are many players left to act behind you you can get three bet off your hand so in general just try and play your tightest range in early position so question three players to my left have been re-raising me very often how do I adjust a keep opening the same range and make and make them keep doing it sorry this was a very poorly written sentence I'm gonna have to change that uh sorry so B fold marginal hands I'd normally open C Min raise instead of a standard 3x big blind raise the raise raised to more than 3x the big blind so the answer is bold marginal hands I'd normally open so yeah unfortunately when you're at an aggressive table you just really need to tighten up a little bit more um you could sometimes start sizing up a little bit more so answer D would be okay only if it um if someone opened and it folded to you and leave position because you can't really adjust your sizing when only one or two players at the table is being super aggressive versus you um but the rest of the players are playing kind of standard so you don't want to you don't want to like start 5x and get pretty flop every hand just because one or two players are picking on you so if this is the case just tighten up a little bit and um against these aggressive players that have been re-raising you throw in some four bets to let them know that they need to stop messing with you so next question my table has shown everyone is playing extremely loose today I have Ace jack off under the gun what should I do should you hold fall raise 3x a big blind for a value or Min raise 2x the big blind so take a minute so the answer is C raised to 3x the big line for a value now I know this is a little confusing because I've said to you in the past if you're at a very aggressive table um you should tighten up a bit but Loose doesn't necessarily mean aggressive there can be a lot of tables where people are playing loose but not a loose range pre-flop but not necessarily aggressive style so not as many three bets or or whatever so um in this type of situation when they're playing a lot of junky hands you can start opening wider for a wider value for range a wider range for value so next question which hand is the best example of maximizing your implied odds is it a is three Suited Ace 10 off nine six Suited king queen off so go ahead and think about it this is maximizing your implied odds not irreverse simple items so the best answer for this is a H3 student this is because if someone has a hand like Ace King and there's an ace on the board um but you flop a flush draw or a straight draw with it with your pair and you wind up getting there um especially when the board Runs Out low like ace deuce four and then you turn a five um you're gonna you're probably going to be able to get more value than if you had a hand like Ace Jack and the river runs out of Jack so this is just a good hand to um where you're gonna your hand is going to be more disguised than when they hit their their top pair with a good kicker they're going to have a hard time folding so let's move on to the next question you're in a tournament with only 13 big blinds and it folds to you on the button you have Ace for suited what should you do memories fold quell or go all in so go ahead and think about it so the answer I chose for this is D go all in so this is just a spot where I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend Min raising um you're not I mean you can in some situations if the blinds are not really gonna three bet you or uh or you don't think that they're gonna shove on you um and you could maybe Min raise for Value but I think you just kind of want to maximize your full Equity by gold going all in and with 13 bigs effective they could call you with a lot worse they could call you with uh in King Jack suited and hands like that so you could be dominating them and shoving oftentimes looks weaker than raising you definitely want you definitely don't want to fold this hand and calling is I think the worst option so let's take a look at the next question what is the best way to adjust your race first in ranges to a very tight table keep my ranges the same tighten my range since they're only playing strong hands themselves widen my range to take advantage of how tight they're playing or call their raises more and try to make hands so they pay you off second so the answer I chose for this is C wide in my range to take advantage of how tight they are playing um you don't want to tighten their ranges just because they're opening only tight only strong hands um that would be silly in it at a tight table there um you're just gonna win so much money by even just taking down the blinds over and over um so and another way to you you can open a lot of hands and get calls and if they show any kind of aggression post lock you can easily fold and move on so you're just gonna print money by opening a lot of hands in a at a very tight table okay so let's move on to the next question what are the best reasons for folding a ham like ace deuce suited under the gun is it a we will be out of position too often B reverse implied odds implications if they flattest with a bigger Ace C this hand is is too weak to play out of position all of the above or E none of the above so the answer that I chose is D all of the above so you don't want a hand like is do suited to be a standard open under the gun especially in cash games for all of these reasons you'll be out of position reverse implied odds implications Etc so in a if you're playing a tournament and um you're at a tight table and the blinds and Annie's are are high you can there's argument for opening hands like any pseudo days under the gun but as your typical under the gun range with 100 big blinds and more I would just fold this because it's just a little bit too weak so let's go ahead and jump to the next question so when you have a low spr you are a more committed to the pot be less committed to the bot or C none of the above so go ahead and take a moment and the answer I gave is a you are more committed to the pot so again the lower the spr the better odds you're getting and the more committed you are to going with the hand okay so let's move on to the next question what is the best way to manipulate spr is it a by raising bigger pre-flop B by three betting and check raising more C flatting more hands D is it a and b is it B and C or is it a and C so go ahead and take a moment so the answer that I chose is D A and B so by raising bigger pre-flop and by three betting and check raising more so basically when you're when you're putting more money in the pot and building bigger pots it lowers the spr so flatting more hands doesn't really make much sense so why are raised first and ranges different in tournaments than in cash games is it because a tournaments are about survival B your chip EV increases as the tournament progress progresses not has see you have to fight for blinds and aunties D you aren't as deep stacked e all of the above or F none of the above so the correct answer is e all of the above so again um all of these first of all tournaments are about survival and your chip your chip EV increases as a tournament progresses uh you need to work more to take down those blinds and Andes because they're just gonna eat away at your stack and you aren't as deep stacked so your ranges are definitely going to change um when you're playing a tournament your ranges will also change in ICM situations so for example when you're nearing the money or if you're at a final table bubble or at the final table and and the page jumps are significant so even then your ranges are going to change but we can do and we will do another presentation on that um at a later date and finally the last question what are implied odds are they a how much you expect to win after you complete your draw be your chip Evie see how many big blinds you have or D how much you expect to lose after you make your hand so the correct answer is a how much you expect to win after you complete your draw so that wraps up today's presentation I hope you guys enjoyed it and learned something remember when thinking about your raise first in ranges um just always think about your opponent's position the table Dynamic your stock sizes and make a calculated decision like I said it is if you're just starting out it's uh it's gonna take you some time to nail down these ranges but after a while you'll start getting it and nothing is set in stone like I said if you um if your table is good you can adjust these ranges if it's tight you know just figure out what is the best strategy and go from there so thanks for watching as always you can ask me any questions on Instagram or Twitter and I'm happy to answer them alright see you guys in the next one thanks", metadata={'source': 'ZUlZSBp0Wc0', 'title': 'How To Play PREFLOP

[Document(page_content="four eight off suit man my guy is a gangster my guy is a gangster he says I like 4-H suited and I like 48 off suit How You Like Me Now on the button let's open it big blind defense okay this is a range bet here obviously we don't have too many hands like this pure trash in our range but we do today and uh on these boards a stew Stein rainbow we just gotta go for a small City bet but we check no no way no way this is the like this is the absolute poker flop right like when didn't anyone want to see the ace nine Deuce rainbow board when they were the pre-flop aggressor um we got a bet here we have eight High there's nothing else to do here but bat sorry like we have eight four off suit we're in the pot why would we ever check here like I'm about to flip out you guys have got me going crazy all right is someone pranking me here you guys are about to send me through the roof all right we have absolutely nothing we need to represent something okay so let's bet this one all right but we check we we hit a pair oh my God we hit a pair like we have something now uh they check again fine uh we go for a small bet we get called our opponent could totally have a nine here our opponent probably doesn't have an a sound much but they could also have a lot of draws diamonds straight draws whatever Jack ten River's a Queen of Diamonds everything gets there they check please clutch please God check this you know you've screwed up not bad in the Flop you hit a pair on the turn just please check this River all right good job foreign Ace um but but again we we find out so much more about this person's range when we bet the Flop right that's my point is if we bet the Flop we know immediately if they have an Acer a nine or you know maybe they have four or five of diamonds or or three five of clubs or three five of Spades they might have some back door gunshot but on the turn we now have to put in all the straights and all the flushes into their range now because we didn't eliminate any of those hands betting the Flop so that's one of the key lessons here of like dissecting somebody's range and clarifying your range button limps we mostly just want to raise here with the stack sizes behind uh given that we have a big stack behind so I would be three to three and a half x three to four here but I don't think we need to be over three all that much since the button only has uh 17 bags But A Min raise okay this is a flop I'd probably be checking just because um we're up against someone who's only got like two times pot left we slam this board basically our opponent's gonna have a lot of weekends so I would just be checking this particular hand since it's top of our range we don't really worry about any turn card so we do check I love to see that from the hero button checks back um this is again it's like same spot we could check and just pray that they start bluffing but um if you want to just go for a small bed here it doesn't matter so that's what we do and we win it so yeah that's just a spot where it's really hard for us to get paid because the button's not going to have a whole so that's why I recommend you could check the turn again to try to induce Bluffs but either way no biggie all right we got King 10 suited on the button this is absolutely going to be a flat call uh this person opened on 12 and a half bigs checks out us um you know I think with this particular hand we could start bluffing small like three bigs this person shoves we got an easy fold uh apply some heat since we don't really have any back door Equity or anything but we check that's fine uh checks to us again I mean we don't have much Showdown value here with King eye I don't believe so I would probably start betting at some point but we now have a gut shot so if you wanted to realize your equity and take one more fine but a bluff is going to be way more believable here so we check we repair this guy goes all in um it's kind of a tough spot now because we're we really made a hand um and what can our opponent have um sure they could have a flush sure they could have a slow played Queen but I think that's kind of unlikely so it's really like a flush or nothing so we we kind of arrived to the river in the strongest hand we have I mean maybe we have some King Jack there too but um but this is just a toss-up now I think a fold this while I'm here mostly but we do have a bluff catcher um I think yeah I prefer a bet bluffing at some point there okay under the gun opens button calls we defend love it flop top two we lead out I don't really think we have leads here in this particular spot um I'd much rather check raise his hand um but under the gun calls awful turn car we just should default the checking here we bet half pot I'm not a huge fan of the way we're playing this hand and uh they get a fold and I think we're just going to see that from like a lot of floats even a Jack X is going to fold here if they made a pair uh 10x even Queen X like a weak Queen they got like Queen nine of clubs or something I don't really think we're gonna see much but yeah I really just don't think we have leads on the swap with this particular hand in these positions and stuff I would have check raised and then I probably would do some small betting and some checking on the turn if I had check raised um because we will have flushes in our range but it's not the best card considering a bunch of straight skate there and stuff so that's why I'm not a huge fan of why we play the turn here I would have preferred a check okay under the gun opens we have four six suited on the button this is a little loose I think five six Suited is fine four six suited is kind of borderline and we flop nothing but a back door we get checked too I probably would start betting and I probably would have a big bet here um or a small bet I mean but I think on this texture board I could start applying pressure to over cards at Ace highs with a three bet considering I do have some backdoor equity but we go small bet and it gets full so that works too pocket aces again small raise button calls good flop for us we can mix between small bed and big bed here on this board out of position we go small bet we get raised now this hand in particular it's not a hand we want to put in another raise here with if we had Jax if we had Queens if we had Kings even then yeah maybe we just want to move all in and get it in against a combo draw or something like that but with Aces where we don't need protection from like a club turning or a seven turning or whatever other car we might be worried about we can just call this bet so that's kind of the difference in when we have over pairs here if our over pairs need more protection we can play it just for a shove when we have the the best of the best with back tours we want to trap so we click it back I mean it's okay but but I would prefer just to call here to keep some of the Bluffs in but I I think this is just saying we have a hand we're not folding whereas if we just call then there's pot left for this person and they can try to Bluff us off like what if we have Queen Jack of Spades or what if we have you know Jack nine here that wants to see another card so I prefer to keep my range open a little bit here what we raise a shove we get it all in and we are up against the 800 clubs here which I almost swear to God I don't know if I said that I don't know if I said that but I thought it next time I'm gonna say but um you know just a 50 50 spot all good um we would have just check called it off on like most turned cards anyway I mean Defending Your small blind with suited connectors is fine but uh uh when they're not connected that's not good so this is like just too disconnected if this was eight six suited okay I don't mind a call here but with eight four suited I think it's just way too many gaps here way too much disconnected there um so already hating this and this is why and I hate the lead too uh when we lead in this spot we get called by hands that just have a bunch of equity against us or already have us beat so like uh King Jack where the Spade could call us Ace Jack over pairs with or without Spades just flushes that have flopped flushes um straight so this is just like a pure Bluff I get it I just am not a fan because I'm not a fan of bluffing in spots where if someone calls us we can't continue our Bluff and this is one of those spots so we get called now like if there was a turn card we could keep bluffing it's this but like we have 18 bigs there's 12 in the middle what do we do so so yeah like I said it's very tough spot but we do continue we get called River somehow brings everything and now I'm baffled as to what possible other move we could have except checking and we go all in and this is about as gangster as it gets because we really shouldn't have too many off suit hands uh we really shouldn't have many nuts playing this way and our opponent could totally have the seven of Spades or the Queen of Spades so this is just uh like balls to the wall please God don't call me and we get a fold so not a fan about this played out anyway this is like aggression to the maximum with no sensibility to it but it worked so um we can't get too upset at it ace5 off suit when there's a early position open sure if we want a three bed Bluff this on occasion that's fine I wouldn't do it too often I'd rather a vase five suited but um definitely can't just call here so we put in a small three bet interesting um I prefer bigger size but fine we go ahead with a quarter pot bet here I love it we get called now we pick up double Equity here added Equity I probably am just going for another bet I really don't think we have a ton of Showdown value with ASI here so I like it we go for a little about half half pot bet and we get a fold and what this is supposed to do it's supposed to Target like the weaker pairs that haven't made a set the queen Jack is now kind of priced out the king queen so well played post-floppier from guitar um although we are maybe getting a little too loose in pre-flop ranges okay King three off suit um yes we can defend this to the cutoff for one big flop top pair we lead again this is one thing I'm noticing we see a lot of leads from our hero and I'm not a huge fan um turn two pair I mean at this point we could either check and try to get a check raise in or just continue betting as played we do bet half bot get called River kind of scary back door flush got there King X could be of like King tennis clubs or something and then uh maybe there is Queen 10 in that Ridge Queen 10 is going to call two barrels so not the best River but we still have enough high value here where we can bet our two pair so I'm indifferent if you wanted to check and like Bluff catch or bet and try to get some value so I I like smaller sizing here and I think third pot is kind of fine for this so I'm not a fan and it works okay two nines uh open on 45 bags we mostly can flat call here with the button but we put in a small three bet I think that's also okay good flop for our hand probably want to be betting I mean our range probably bet small here on this board four deuce deuce uh but some of the hands in our range probably have bigger bets and I might imagine this being one of them lots of over cards that can come on the turn so maybe this is where we size up a little bit with these hands but a small bed is fine typically so we go small we get called uh probably betting again for Value even though this is a three bed pot um probably going a third here again uh six seven big blinds just to get called by the ace axes like today's Queens these jacks and then um we don't want to value on ourselves here by betting full pot because what if we get shoved on our opponent could still have like Jacks Queens Kings and Aces so we go really small okay fine I don't think we need to be this small but I think it's okay we get called River who doesn't love to see this River car just gives us a nuts um now this is the one thing you know about the turn sizing it being so small is if we go five six seven digs there it changes how pot looks for us on the river a little bit but whatever we got 150 pot shove if we so choose to take it here on the river and I think that's the best all in all in for 34 big blinds into 23. but we bet pot which is good enough and we get a fold so likely just have the best thing in the whole way there but well played well played all right we raised that here we got an ace Jack we can Hmm this is close 25 bigs we're almost in the in the portion where we could just stuff this here um so I'm in between a call and an all-in um we make a small three bet I I prefer this more with Ace Jack suited I think Ace jack off suit just wants to stuff it but we get a good flop we do a small bet fine I think I think we could have some even checks on this board but betting small is fine we get called turns a queen we're gonna have to check now but we don't we bet so I think we're just being overly aggressive in some of these spots like now look at where our hamstrings went our hamstring went pretty strong we have a good Ace with a good kicker and a straight draw now our a strength is really weak because we chop with all of their Aces we lose the queen X um so yeah I'm not a fan of this turn bet here so when we get to the turn our hand strength has been diminished greatly we now chop with all Ace X's we lose to Queen X so I would just be checking here it's very kind of a problematic net to be make to make and we get shoved on and it's like of course we get shoved on here um what do we do we call to chop it now so so this sucks I might even consider folding at this point and we do full so okay gangster back in the streets with the seven eight off suit definitely in here as a defend we flop a gut shot we lead um like again too much leading like we're gonna be up against open ranges that are going to be playing in position against us it's going to get very scary um turns a queen like I don't want to consider getting I don't want to continue giving advice on hands that like are being played as they shouldn't be so I don't know what to do here is basically what I'm gonna say um it's like if we bet again sure we're representing a queen but our opponent's not going to fold any pairs our opponent opponent could have a queen themselves so like I would have preferred like check raising this hand if we had like a club or something rather than just leaving it but anyway we lead again on the turn and we get a fold which this is just pure exploitative play so uh it's against my rule book to comment on too many of these hands all right um we're on the butt and we got the jacket off fine now I do like to see the hero start making small array sizes so that's good like fine if you want to start with bigger race sizes while everyone's deeper and reduce it as tournament progresses fine all right button uh button versus big blind we just want to see about this board a lot especially with our nothing hands that wrap around the board a little bit like a nine we can keep barreling a seven we can keep barreling a queen or King we can keep barreling so I like uh bet here and we could even have some bigger bets on this sizing but mostly it's going to be smaller so we check so that's another thing I'm seeing like you want to only check when you have something you want to check when you have like King High you want to check when you have a small pair like you want to check when you have some Showdown value if your hand doesn't have a lot of Showdown value like Queen Jack here could chat because Queen High could be good against the big blind but like Jack eight should just be betting all right turn to King uh they check again we now should mandatorily bet our Jack Kai but we check rivers of six we just are happy to check John Jack high and I'm not a huge fan because we don't apply any pressure to 3x to 6X to a 10x um or queen High the other hand that we're losing to which I forgot to mention under the gun opens two bigs we're on the cutoff I think we mostly want a three bet here we can have like a small amount of calls but either or fine we go with a small three bet again in position Mick Willis has got to be tired of us and of course he is of course he's tired of us he comes with the four bet um small sizing is whatever when we get four but I I think we just have to fold but we're getting really good pot odds here right we only need 30 Equity but um yeah I think we just gotta let it go we call okay but we have 25 bigs here and we gotta call another eight and a half yeah this is really dicey this is really really dicey like I said if we were king queen suited we could have had a flat call pre-flop um that's gonna play a lot easier in position and then that would like call bets but this hand is a little more dice but whatever we can call here like we're getting good pot odds we just can't fold if we flop any equity and here we go um and we were up against Ace Jack all right two fours button opens with 30 bigs what are we doing here with two floors this my first challenge for the class button opens here to two bigs we got two fours here so calling here is not awful we can set mine but calling here is going to be very difficult to play a lot of flops because what do we do when we don't flop a set so that's tough three betting it to eight or nine bigs is okay but what if we get shoved on if they shove are we really three bedding to eight bigs and then calling a 30 big blank shop yeah we could but we're gonna be like flipping mostly right so with all that said the last option Takes the Cake and that is all in here we're pumping it up here we're all in and the reason being here is look at the opening range now we assume that this person is going to be playing 50 of the hands here and then calling all in with I don't know 12 to 15 of them so we're going to be just winning this pot like eight out of 10 times when we go all in and then the two out of ten times we get a call we're most likely flipping so this is just a spot where the wind chips a whole lot seeing flops if we three bet we really don't win chips a whole lot by three bet calling or three bet folding right and then if we shove we just win four and a half Bigs like a lot and then we have the potential to win another 30 against the calling range and this calling range will be like Ace 10 suited Ace Jack Ace Queen is King it will obviously be all pairs like fives plus I mean Deuces and threes can fold but um you know maybe someone folds fives or sixes here but mostly those are called all right so let's see what we did we did the mini Rays my my my the option I didn't even talk about because it's the worst option on the planet the mini mini Rays here I hate it I'm getting Punk so like I said um but here's why again this is why the three-bit option sucks look at this we three bet the four bigs now did we just call off 27 bigs here you know probably not do we have 43 Equity prob maybe probably you know the way we've been playing it's probably a coin flip but again um I would have just prefer a shove so I have no idea what our hero is going to do but they they they they fall men raised till yeah okay easy defend with the seven nine suited flop middle pair we're just gonna be check calling here and we go for the check Min raise we're A Min raise freaking Warrior Man patar the Min Ray's Warrior um and then look we Min raise it and we get clicked it back so we just can't fold here like the way we're playing we just can't fold here oh my God no what are we doing all right all right I need a break for a second guys I need a break we definitely aren't getting through this whole hand history today yes we are noticing villains Tendencies and and so like let's all right let's let's take a step back let's take a step back let's try to get into the mind of of the hero here are our hero guitar we we men raise for Value we think we have the best of it but here's the thing with Min raising here it starts it starts telling what we have and it starts building a pot and it it also reopens the action these are like the basics of Poker right these are the fundamentals of Poker if we just call the bet we get a free card if we raise there's the possibility that we have to pay more tax to see the next card this is the fundamental lesson here which we don't want to abuse that it's like a universal law like if we can see a cheap car for a good price when we might have the best hand like the universal law says call that bet right like so so yeah this is the spot where we have a great hand against the button range we just want to call we want to see a turn card and then if we raised we're not getting any information like our opponent could just be bluffing us here they could do this with Jack 10 with 10 8. they could have nothing like Ace 10. so yeah we're we're just putting ourselves in a really dicey spot and now we might even be folding the best hand given we only need to be good 20 of the time here 20 of the time this person has to have a bluff or a worse hand for us to continue and then the other thing is we have good turn cards here we could turn a heart we can turn a seven we can turn to nine so so yeah I'm not a fan of this either Larry says do you ever use the Min raise the Min check raise post flop play are there situations where it makes sense yes Larry there are most likely when we're nutted or when we're bluffing like if we're semi-bluffing like let's say we wanted to like check raise Jack 10 off suit here or like Jack 10 with the back door I think you could totally you know go from 1.8 to four bigs or something which is almost what they did um but those hands would also continue to another raise so this this hand kind of is even better than that okay King six in the small this is an easy shove for 12 big blinds effective we just call um yeah so King six offsuit is going to be just perform really good as a shove most of our offsuit Kings here will just shove uh we could now just small see about this flop um as a semi Bluff it's a board that's going to favor us our opponent should never have a sex but we check probably wouldn't be folding here with the King of Clubs to a half pot bet but we do okay it's interesting I wouldn't have folded king queen shove we Min click it back this is one time it is appropriate to do so I have no problem with this button calls with 100 bigs ooh like we have nothing to win in the side pot so I probably would just check this but I do think we do have like a good bluff candidate with this hand uh if there was any money in the side pot oh wait we do have money in this iPod right oh okay hmm guys this might be a good spot to Bluff because there's eight bigs in the side pot so I might be betting here if I was if I was a hero but we check goes check check and now we fold to a bet oh and we lost this iPod to Nines um yeah dang we are a gangster man we are a gangster so again I'm not a fan of three betting this hand because this person only has 20 bigs we're out of position they can just shove and we don't get to realize their Equity so not a fan uh we flop a gut shot though and win the pot so it's cool to see the aggression like I don't want to berate the aggression too much but poker is all about selective aggression and uh like we're kind of getting ourselves in problematic spots that only look good because our opponents like are folding so maybe we're just not running into it as much as we really would okay under the gun opens we have Jack tens suited here on the cut off easy call um mostly yeah mostly you want to call here flop middle pair big blind leads person other person calls I think we can just call here we flop middle pair we're getting 20 immediate odds love it turn is a six we should all check love it river is a three um we are now strictly Bluff catching and I don't think this person's gonna have too many Bluffs considering they bet the Flop into two players and now they're betting but yeah we have a bluff catch if we want a bluff catch we don't have a heart that's good um but we do have a blocker to some of maybe these persons Bluffs like Jack nine Queen Jack yada yada so we do have a bluff catcher so flip a coin if you feel like this person would lead the Flop with hearts and then would also bet the river here into two players then then flip a coin and call but if not I think you can just hold so we do call so we do bluff catch Zach we're going to get your answer this is results oriented thinking everybody so if we do see a heart draw here this won't be all the time but let's see and we did have a bluff so they were bluffing with the gutty so really weak really weak play like this person shouldn't be bluffing with his hand here and the reason why they shouldn't be bluffing with the gutty is because you're out of position against two players on this board where you're never getting anyone to fold Queen Jack Ace Jack Ace Queen Jack thine Queen nine uh heart draw 10x King X like look at all those hands I just listed that are never folding even eight nine that beat you is not folding to your bet eight nine bro is not folding so yes this is just a not a play that should happen if someone's playing accordingly so if you know that someone's this wide in ranges and this maniacal which is not a word but if you know that they are then you should be calling here with a pair of tens on the river absolutely so well played uh patar well played all right uh we got a 2.75 X from this guy who's been clowning around with the seven eight we got the Ace King suited what are we doing we're gonna three bet this so what kind of sizing look at here's here's where we where we were like normally we want to be three and a half 4X here when we're out of position but we're also deep we're also 50 big blinds plus deep here so think about what sizing that would be for you so yeah I think we need to be at least at least eight big blinds here eight or more at least eight or more see here's the other thing this person made it 2.75 X so we really could make it like 4X here and go like 12 Bigs like there's nothing wrong with us playing Big Pop poker here so I anywhere from like 8 to 12 bigs is cool with me and we click it back we of course the Min Rays Warrior he doesn't care what we think 5.5 gigs all right so anyway this isn't now now here's the thing this is the one good thing I will say about this this isn't bad when we have hands like this when we have like monsters that are suited that are going to be easy hands to play it's not that bad to invite someone to call you the problem is though is we lose out on the money we would make from this person calling a bigger three bet like let's say they're gonna call every three that we make they'll call nine bigs and they'll call 5.5 what we just missed out on three and a half big blinds here if we didn't make it nine so that's why I don't like small sizing here and we get called okay uh you know this is the Flop where we probably should be doing some small betting and we go half pot I think it's fine we get called I might just Barrel this off honestly I don't you know I I had had I played this had I played this and this was me what would this be this would be eight or nine bigs right so it'd be 20 bigs in the middle on the Flop and I'd be betting like five bigs and then I would be shoving all in on the turn so so I don't know how to play it now with this stack size I'd probably be checking um but if if we wanted to just blast off completely I don't mind it honestly so we check goes check check wherever the five I think fine we can go small value better just check but we're probably going to run into a lot of pairs here and we run into a horse oh my god let's go Batar Bazar let's go let everyone let's look at this master master master class in in small small pop poker here from from our hero so look we we went with the small that on half pot on the Flop we got called by the worst ace high we check check the turn and then the river I don't have a problem with the small bat honestly honestly I don't I think we could also check it but we do check down against Ace X's right ace Jack is Queen so this is the good thing about this bet it freezes our opponent if our opponent has a hand like sixes sevens tens maybe they just call us and we just get our Showdown value and if they do have some worse hands like ace deuce suited Ace uh four suited Ace 10 suited Ace Jack Ace Queen then hey we get some value so well played there 6'4 Suited so again these if this is five six suited we could call here I don't think six four student wants to do all the calling that much um but but it's not like the worst hand so fine we get a big flop we lead we get called turn a pair I probably would be checking at this point um because we have Showdown value uh you could even check shove all in but um yeah we go for a small bet again get called river is awful I think we should start checking at some point but we bet small again is a block bet and we get called and oh my God what is this chip dumping I'm seeing what is going on here all right I'm amazed so somehow like all this makes sense to me right like Queen 10 opens fine Queen 10 calls a flop that fine Queen 10 calls another small bet on the turn fine but Queen 10 calling two big blinds on the river yeah and we had the best of it so yeah um I'm speechless I'm gonna move on to the next hand all right we got Queen High here we got back door Hearts uh we mostly want to be betting here but we check turn I would be folding now okay so we missed a flop bet here Ace King raising a re-raise um again this is another spot where we can just call we don't mind inviting Running Aces in or you know we do have a stronger hand that's willing to get it all in so we could also like click it here to whatever whatever the click would be 25 bigs so we shove I think that's fine too no big deal foreign easy defend here with the five six suited could even three bet this sometimes but our opponent's stack is dwindled so I I think just calling is good flop open-ended we bet we we do see our our opponent our hero bet a lot and I think that's something they got to clean up it's gonna be very hard to play like that so at this point like with the flush draw out here I would just call I wouldn't be happy getting all my money in right now oh and we fold no we can't ever fold here we we we we we think we have eight clean outs we might have more so yeah we can't fold here at Batar we gotta call and see a three year and eight turn hopefully uh this is also why we just don't lead if we just check we can call a vet and realize our Equity so that's kind of the the lesson here all right I gotta go faster I'm not getting through this today two-part session everybody we're gonna watch patar climb all the way to the final table playing playing his unorthodox Style all right button opens we can totally flat call 108 suited I love this play here checks around um probably would keep checking but if we did want to bet like I think this hand is okay to Bluff at you have a gut shot we have some over cards if nobody has a king or object so fine big blind call is going to be the widest of ranges and I think like we have a give up but we don't block Spades so like if you wanted to bet here you could I probably go for a big sizing like eight bigs or something we go small sizing and get called and we get called by a jack so that's kind of the hand we wanted to Target a Jacker Spades to fold and small sizing isn't going to cut that but fine no biggie Ace Queen we raise get called by both blinds Jack Jack four flop I probably just go for a small C bet we check so that's another thing we're seeing too from our hero too much too much checking too many too many too many checks on the flop turn is a five we don't know if we have like the best of it we assume we do but yeah check or a small bet I guess River we just checked down no need to bet and we lose to five six because we didn't bet the five so we defend King eight perfect this is a flop we would check call we have King High we have a gut shot we have a backdoor Diamond so we don't need to like Bluff all that much here but sure if you wanted to check raises as a bluff you could um but wheat is fold so this is a mistake too we're folding in spots where we have Equity we're folding in spots where we have outs a seven gives us a win a king High could be good if we're up against like Queen Jack or up against Jack eight you know there's some hands we can beat um so that's some other uh the nuances I've noticed here we got Queens against a button open easy three bet spot we don't ever want a flat call here we don't ever want to shove we just want a three bet to like six and a half or seven big blinds something that looks like we could just be pouncing on against these short stacks love it thank you patar let's go baby we finally put in a good Gray size here and and I and I believe this is because Batar finally feels comfortable with his hand in the other hands with the pocket floors and the ace Jack and stuff I feel like we saw small Ray sizes because maybe our hero didn't know how to play those hands so here we see a lot more comfortability it looks like and uh we win that 7-5 suited fine let's raise the button uh we definitely want to bet this flop with a double gut shot in the ace high board good bet we get called we turn a pair we can just check now so here this this is a Bad Bet because the three or four that we now beat is gonna fold the ace is still going to call the deuce is gonna call so this is this really this bet doesn't really get called by things that we beat uh sure maybe diamonds on occasion but still it it it shouldn't and we get shoved on that's also why we check two tens comes in for a small three bet I think two tens here wants to have bigger three bets so I look at the stack size behind me here dictating my sizes so I I know I'm gonna be like two to three x usually but look at the stacks we got 27 24 20 and then a big stack so I'm probably gonna gonna make my sizing a little bit bigger here to like 6.6.5 big blinds just because if these people want to play the hand I want them to shove and same with the opener so four is a little too small um and I think like eight would be like fine too but but you don't need to be that big and somehow we just win the pot with the mini Rays okay two tens again raise button calls with 50 bigs okay this is a flop we're gonna check a lot we don't have a diamond sure we have like two pair but it's just a spot where with there being an over card um and has having no diamond we want to check mama you could bet don't get me wrong your hand's strong enough to bet but you're it's going to be a lot easier to play this if you try we bet we get called turns a nine that's really good for us but I don't think we should really have too many bets right now we do we have a half pot bet we get raised all in and again this is why I just hate playing these hands like this and then we fold so like we don't know if we're up against king queen of diamonds or like King 10 of diamonds right like we don't have the ton of diamonds here we don't know what we're up against we could be up against Ace 10 of diamonds ten so like just when we play these spots aggressive like the point I want to make about this is it looks like our hands very strong here but it's not our opponent can have trip Jacks our opponent can have a diamond draw our opponent can have all the worst pairs so yes our hand is in fact strong but it's not strong enough to bet a flop comfortably and get called and then bet the turn comfortably and get called so this was a mistake and uh and we see our opponents show us the the the straight but um but yeah I think we could play that hand a lot differently and I think we probably like get to the river with our hand as I would play it I would just be check calling return Queen three off I would probably just fold this to an early position raise uh check check we now turn a flush draw we now River repair and we get value two Aces could flat call slow play this or just come in for a small three bet this is where I don't mind a small three bet like if you want to make it five bigs or whatever but we call love it we check to the Flop uh I think this is a spot where we probably want to check raise uh multi-way could just check shove since they both have like pot left we do check raise we get it all in and we beat Kings sweet okay we got an open here on the cut off I think East jack off would just be an all-in uh for reasons I stated before 25 big blind cut off open gonna be playing like 25 30 of hands only calling like 10 All In we just shove here usually but whatever we click it they call we see that the Flop as a bluff okay um yeah it's just really hard to play these spots post-flop so I can't comment too much like I would recommend maybe just shoving again on the turn for pot since they can't have Ace King um and they don't have like pocket tens so that's probably what I would do but we'd go small bet and they shove on us Ace nine off here um I think we just want to do some three betting like to get this person all in or some shoving for 30 big blinds effective it's probably a little too much um but I think it's okay but we call that's okay but I think it gets 20 bigs we wanted mostly three bet and I probably wouldn't be folding two over cards with Ace hide a small bet that often here but we see these guys play a pot and Ace King loses to 7-4 uh two tens all in three bet okay we three bet they shove we call now love it love it well played here B days King and on this note hand 61 we'll will stop here um I'm your coach Tristan Wade appreciate y'all take

[Document(page_content="today we're going over a combative Torx and you know part of combinatorics is going to be blockers and removal effect things that I overlooked quite heavily when I was early on in my poker career but later came to respect so here's an example of why competent torques matter On In this River spot let me go over the prior action so we're on the button with pocket nines under the gun raises we three bet under the gun calls Queen nine five we see about one-third call Jack of Spades we see about two-thirds with our set under the gun calls again six of clubs on the river and the opponent snapshubs 63 into 77 big blinds and we're sitting here with nines um Odin showed us that pocket nines is worth slightly more than nothing as a call about four big blinds um we don't have pocket nines that block Club flushes obviously because uh the nine of clubs was on the flop Aces with the Ace of clubs is worth close to 70 big blinds as a call so making so much money here calling with the uh Aces with the Ace of clubs even though it's just a single pair versus a set um why is this it's just because of you know the our understanding of blockers and combos when we have the Ace of clubs we're removing so much of this value he's going to have in his uh range playing like this he's gonna have Ace five of clubs a seven of clubs Ace eight of clubs is ten of clubs is Jack of clubs some Ace King of Clubs especially when you're playing against passive opponents that don't um you know check raise fly uh check raise blood flops a lot you'll have you know there will be a lot of uh flush draws in their range we even saw Kings with the King of Clubs um being close to indifferent on this River just because uh it's not blocking those you know eight combos of nut flushes so that's why combinatorics matter here's here's the piyo SIM for the same spot um I use slightly different pre-flop parameters but you can see here uh piyo had it at 90 Aces with the Ace of clubs 93 big blinds as a call Aces no Club worth nothing and 93 big blinds in one hand is obviously massive uh this can be the difference between a winning and a losing player if you're playing you know 5 10 cash this is nine hundred dollars you know nine hundred dollars spread out over 20 hours of play is 45 dollars an hour so making this call you know could be the difference between a winning cash game player and a losing cash game player and just understanding that nines is worth close to nothing and Asus with Ace of clubs is worth everything so today we're going to go over commentatorics the basics removal effects waiting and then we're going to go over some application and examples using uh solvers so counting combos the basics so there's six combos of each pocket pair um if we look at pocket aces we have the Ace of Spades and that can be matched with the Ace of Hearts Ace of clubs Ace of Diamonds twice 16 combos of any two random cards um Ace king queen ten six five Etc so basically Ace King uh you're going to get Ace King about three times as much as uh pocket aces there's 1326 prefall combinations of hands possible um so a shortcut if someone if the button is raised in you know the button's raising uh 50 of hands uh what I do to find out how many combos that is in game is I just multiply that by 10. so he's gonna have about 500 Combos and then you just increase it by about a third so you know a third of 500 is 160 so I say roughly he has 660 combos pre-flop if the guy is Raising under the gun and you're trying to figure out how many combos that is that's um he's raising 20 under the gun that means on average he's going to have if if there were a thousand pre-flop combinations he would have 200 combos but there's about a third more than a thousand so he's going to have about 250 pre-flop combinations hopefully that makes sense it's not too confusing so here are your six uh combos of aces the Ace of Spades Ace of Diamonds Ace of Spades clubs Ace of Spades ace of hearts um and then you just you know Ace of Diamonds has three combinations as well but we already counted them here is the visual of your 16 combos of all other hands so the Ace of Spades can be accompanied with the King of Spades the Ace of Spades can be accompanied with the King of Clubs the Ace of Spades can be accompanied with the King of Hearts and the Ace of Spades can be accompanied with the king of diamonds so that's four one two three four ace of spades combos Ace King is four combos here and then you're just gonna do that same thing with with each suit so we just went over Ace of Spades then you go to Ace of clubs while the Ace of clubs can be matched with the King of Clubs the King of Hearts the King of Spades and the King of Diamonds uh and then the same thing with heart combinations Ace of farts with the King of Hearts and then ace of hearts with the three other suits so there's four combinations that start with the Ace of Spades Ace King with the Ace of Spades there's four combinations of hands that start with the Ace of clubs Ace of clubs and the Four Kings ace of hearts and the Four Kings and the ace of diamonds and the four different Kings so that's 16 combinations total um and then out of those 16 combinations as you can see here we have four combinations of pseuded Ace King and then we have 12 combinations of uh off suit combinations a mix here so for every Ace do suited there's going to be four combos I'm sorry for every um 16 combos of ace deuce there's going to be four combos of Ace do suited and then 12 combos of ace deuce off um let's see here is a chart of uh opening ranges this is about 25 of hands when you see in this top right triangle is all suited hands so we have the asex suited for each one of these boxes there are four combinations just like we uh just went over there's four combinations of Ace King Suited four combinations of Ace Queen Suited all the way down and then the same thing with all these King X Suited and then the the bottom triangle here is all of your offsuit combos so we have Ace King off suit with 12 combinations so there are substantially more off-suit combinations than there are suited so this the tiles are kind of a little bit uh misrepresentative of the number of combos right because in this Ace King suited box it's talk it is referring to four different hand combinations and this Ace King off box it's referring to 12 different hand combinations so these boxes are not weighted to the frequency at which the hand combinations occur so just keep that in mind and then also going down the middle here these boxes represent pocket pairs which only have six combinations of hands so these are the six combinations of aces are more frequent than Ace King suited but less frequent than Ace King off um so yeah kind of basic stuff but incredibly important and I think often overlooked so we're going to go over removal effects on a flop of a73 there are no longer six possibilities of pocket aces for top set and that is because there is an ace already on the board these three combinations are impossible for your opponent to have uh because of removal effects so when you see this board we can quickly say instead of six combos of Aces sevens and threes occurring there's only going to be three of each so in total against a range of someone that's playing a hundred percent of hands he will have nine combos of sex so if this person with a hundred percent of hands that's this flop and only has value bets yeah sure you will have nine sets but he's also going to have 12 combos of Ace King 12 combos of Ace Queen 12 commas of Ace Jack usually it would be 16 combos of Ace King but there's an ace on the board so we're reducing the 16 combos of Ace King gets reduced by a quarter down to 12. and usually there's 16 combos of Ace Queen but the Ace of Spades is missing so now that means the opponent with a hundred percent of hands can only have 12 combos of Ace Queen 12 combos of Ace Check 12 combos of ace 10. so it's important that when you're facing bets and you're trying to range your opponent um you know let's say let's say you defend the big blind the button raises and you defend the big blind and this is the board your opponent that's a third pot how much more likely is it for him to have Ace X you know Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack Ace 10 Ace nine Ace eight all the way down to Ace two rather than a set so of all of those hands I just mentioned today's King is Queen those are 12 combos each and then sets are only three combo seats so you're not dealing with the Set uh very often at all even if the person is only value-betting uh top pair plus let's say so this is removal effects um kind of talked about this a little bit but on this board of a73 when the button raises and we defend the big blind since the Ace of Spades is on the board the the button cannot have Ace King of Spades Ace of Spades King of Clubs Ace of Spades King of Hearts Ace of Spades King of Diamonds so these four combos are removed and if he had 16 combos of Ace King pre-flop he now can only have 12 combos of Ace King one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so that is how removal effects work now let's go over waiting so this is going to get uh a little bit confusing here so after you're counting your combos you also need to do a little bit of what I call waiting so if we raise under the gun and the button calls you guys are 50 big blinds deep on a flop of a73 if we're trying to count sets we could quickly say oh okay well the guy could have three combos of Aces three combos with sevens and three combos or threes um if you were looking at this very sh in a shallow way but we need to remember that when we raise onto the gun and the button calls we can expect our opponents to three bet Aces at close to 100 percent frequency so he can't have Aces on this board so we need to realize that he has zero combos of bases on this board or close to zero and then let's say it's a opponent playing well but kind of tight so maybe he Flats all of his pocket sevens but only Flats threes about a third of the time roughly you think you think that maybe he would flat threes but but most likely he would fold threes so if he bets the flop we can assume that he's going to have all three combos of seven seven because sevens play like this pre-flop and then instead of giving him three combos of pocket threes let's just give him one combo with pocket threes because we know that he's kind of a tighter guy who would mostly fold Breeze pre-flop so let's say we bet and he raised the flop if we're trying to understand what his value range is we could say that he has four combos of sets you know and then we're gonna weigh that against what other types of hands you could have could he have worse could he have a sex or value How likely is he to raise a hand like five six of diamonds any type of five six suited any type of four or five suited which he might have you know let's say he has a hundred percent of four five and five six Suited pre-flop there we now know that there's eight combos of those you know but how often is he gonna raise those eight combos and and you know and this is the type of a brief analysis that you want to be doing on these types of boards it's a little bit confusing and it takes um some time to learn but once implemented you will see results slowly it's not something that's going to happen overnight and sure you could play poker without ever learning any of this stuff and you know just go ahead with a mediocre at a low win rate by just you know relying on your other strengths but this is an important you know thing to understand and think about um you know if if you have let's say let's say this opponent might be raising Ace Queen Ace Jack Ace 10 on the flop we know like half of the time um he's going to have let's say 12 combos of Ace Queen 12 combos of Ace Jack and 12 combos of Base 10. that's 36 and if he's only going to raise let's say maybe he raises those hands half of the time on the flop he has 18 combos of weaker or non-nutted asex and then he has four combos of sets 22 combos of uh a value range and then you're weighing that against what could he be Bluff raising with and would he Bluff raise this flop and what hands would he use and then trying to come up with some sort of a strategy to combat that type of value Bluff relationship um so now the question for you guys is how many combos of A7 suited uh would this button player have on this flop just take a second to think about it let's assume firstly that he plays a hundred percent of his A7 suited and his ace3 Suited pre-flop so for A7 Suited he's going to have it he could have a seven of hearts or a seven of clubs for two combos what gets confusing is if he's three betting how is he gonna play these suited Aces see going to three bet or call or fold them so against a standard tournament recreational we could assume that he's mostly just going to be folding these hands pre-flop so when if he were to raise this board maybe we give him instead of the four combos that we just assigned him maybe he only Flats let's just say he Flats half of his asex Suited so instead of having four combos of two pair now he only has two combos of two pair so if we now go back and look at what is complete value range might look like if he were to raise us on this flop we're dealing with three sets of sevens one set of Threes that's four let's say he plays let's say he plays a third of Ace Queen Ace Jack Ace 10 is a raise that's 36 divided by 3 is 12. so 12 plus the four sets is 16 and then we gave them uh two two two pair combos so he has 20 hands of strongest value that raises this flop and then you know you're thinking about what he raises as a bluff I think most players probably find it hard to find a ton of Bluffs on this flop definitely I would take the under on 20 combos of Bluffs to be raising with that value range so getting a little dense but this is how you know to beat higher Stakes cash higher Stakes tournaments you you kind of want to start thinking on this level this is uh you know very in-depth uh analysis but at least understanding the basics where you know your opponent likely has only four possible combination of sets on this flop versus all the other hands you can have is the uh important part all right so applications and examples so where I use combinatorics very often is when I am blood catching and then also bluffing to be aware of how my opponent could exploit me if he understands comets works but we're going to go over a bluff catching example so on this board let's just pull up uh our Sim so we defend big blind cut off raises we defend big blind 977 flaw we checked the original razor and the original razor is going to see about this let's call it close to um close to 100 of the time and we have let's just say we have like the ace 10 board runs out three of Clubs check check turn goes check check river is the deuce of diamonds and cut off that's uh about 80 pot we have Ace 10 off uh we have to our call has to be good here about 30 percent of the time so we want to be trying to think if he can come up with enough Bluffs here uh when we think about his range he's raising about 36 percent of hands pre-flop that's roughly 500 combos of hands his value range that he might take this line with would be pocket pairs above the nine let's say tens Jacks Queens Kings Aces there's six combos each of those um I think a decent chunk of those are betting the turn um that was like 30 combos half of which I think bet the turn so like 15 combos of over pairs you were nine he's gonna have a ton of 9x right he's gonna have 12 combos of Ace nine 12 combos King Nine twelve commas Queen nine twelve combos of Jack nine half of which bet the turn so value range let's just say is River value range is around 80 to 100 combos come back here very very rough very very rough math so 80 to 100 combos of uh just call it 100 combos of value on the river we only have to be good one in three times when we make the call so he needs to come up with roughly 50 combos of Bluffs 60 combos of Bluffs for us to break even so let's let's look at all the possible uh Bluffs that he could could use here there's 16 combos of 10 Jack 16 combos of uh Queen 10 16 combos of King 10. 16 combos of King Queens 16 combos of King Jack 16 combos of Queen Jack he has I don't think he's turning asex into a bluff he has all those five six suited eight ten Suited Jack eight Queen eight King eight Suited four or five Suited so if we only have to be good here one in three times and he roughly has a hundred value combos that are betting this River um you know things are looking quite favorable for a call on this specific run out um you know I would hero call here much wider than GTO would suggest and then there are boards and situations uh where I would call much tighter than GTO suggests um so I think you can you know point being here is if you do the analysis and you look at all the different combinations of hands that he could get to this River in the spot especially if it's an aggressive cut off you can print a lot of money here by Hero calling quite wide like even any ace high whereas if the board is something like king queen Jack and he bet that bets you know you can start folding second pair or top pair to some opponents um because of the cut off what the cutoffs range looks like and his bet aggression um and the amount of possible Bluffs he could have on rivers on a board of king queen Jack versus nine nine seven seven so hopefully that all makes sense um the next slide so more combo uh counting the hijack races pre-flop we defend the big blind with Queen for uh Suited let's look at this Sim on this one this is a hydrax range pre-flop it's going to be 29 of hands or 400 combos as for Queen X that he's going to have he's going to be raising as wide as Queen six Suited our range will have Queen X down to Queen two suited and we'll have down to Queen eight off so we check we can expect hijack to bet uh at close to 100 frequency this is a hand I played a couple weeks ago as well and then I had Queen do suited and I just called the Flop and I was checking to make sure that that was okay if we raise the Flop with Queen do Suited um he's going to have by the river if we raise flop and bet bet he's going to have a decent amount of Queen X so we can count those combos now he has we have a queen so he has four combos of Ace Queen we had Queen Deuce of Spades so he can have the Queen of Clubs and the four different Aces he can have the Queen of Clubs and the four different Kings he can have the Queen of Clubs in the four different jacks um and the four different tens so that's 16 combos there he can have pocket nines for three combos of pocket nines so that's 20 combos of hands that beat us uh and he started the hand with about 380 combos so he's gonna be beating us his hand is moving better than ours uh about one in 15 times let's say uh if we raise flop at bet half of the hands that call on the river are going to be hands at beat us anyways so it's not a super profitable line we are getting value X you know we're getting value on the Flop check raise by weird Sands and we're getting we're barreling turn and getting called by War Sands so we're getting two streets of added value but we do need to keep in mind that even though we have trips he does have a hand that beat you know he has 20 combos Queen X on this board or queen X or better on this board so that's why you're seeing Queen Deuce Queen three Queen four played uh as a high frequency call on this board if we let's let's say we raise flop here to 40 percent and then we just Barrel on blanks barrel and then shove on blanks so of course we're getting money in good on the flop and we've got two-thirds and we're going to be getting money in very good on the turn as well but on like a blank River we shove Our Queen Deuce as the solver would have us do on this River um look at how much Queen X he has King uh king queen queen Jack Queen 10 Queen nine Queen eight he has um he has about 34 combos that call this River and about half of those beat us so while we're you know this riverbed well it looks good um isn't that great like half of the time close to half of the time that we get called We're beat um so this riverbat is not like printing a ton of money whereas if we just check call flop we can induce a lot of Bluffs from his range uh on the turn or river uh and or river and then the additional benefits of calling with Queen deuce on the Flop is uh if turn goes check check you can just go pot or over bet um with your trips the solver likes to go we can we can look at that line in them in a second you know our hand is not that vulnerable um on the Flop so you know it's it's fine to play as a check call you're protecting yourself I mean the the value of raising versus calling uh is quite similar let's just look at let's look at what happens when we call flop and turn goes check check so let's say he doesn't decide to uh bet that turn he doesn't Bluff likely has a showdown value like ace high or pocket eights pocket sevens maybe a week nine three of spades on the river the solver is going to say we should like bet sixty percent pot with Queen X and 9x and protect our range because we're betting you know we're protected against raises because we're using the same size with our weaker hands and our stronger hands but in you know in practice let's see here Queen X goes mostly 33 or 66 pot and then our 9x goes the same sizes and we can't be exploited if he decides to raise you know in practice I think that when hijacked checks back on this turn his range is much more capped than it should be um and we're dealing more with more ace high low pair type of a range rather than you know some tricky check backs with Queen X and 9x and and over pairs so I think versus that range like we can just go you know bet like 15 here um so point being is even just because we checked called flop doesn't mean we're not getting a lot of money in uh when we're still the worst case scenario if he checks turn and we can just over bet River and get called by a lot worse like half the time um so you know in game my understanding of just like quickly counting like how many combos of Queen XC has on this flop and realizing that like my queen two is not the nuts for 50 big blinds I think was pretty important some more examples so for three betting ranges uh blockers play a huge role that's why we see you know when the button opens we're in the small blind this is our strategy you notice how much junk uh Ace X off suit we're using to three bet here uh and that's primarily because we have that Ace blocker uh and then the you know you see the King five King six King seven suited being three bet here at a very high frequency uh because we have those blockers the rest of the hands are kind of for Value you know you know like a hand like king queen off like we don't mind getting flatted because we're playing the butt the button who has a you know a wide range and we have two decent High cards but this like if you have a hand like A7 off you do such a good job of removing all of the this is the buttons uh strategy versus a small blind three bet you do with it with a hand like A7 off you do such a good job removing all of these continues like look look at you know a sign off plus plus is pure continued every asex suited is either flatted or four bet um and this you know this Ace X is a massive part of the buttons continuing range it's you know it seems like it's almost about 25 or 30 percent maybe even more of his of his continuing range facing a three-bed so when we block when we have that just ace any card A7 off and it you know A7 off is going to perform very poorly as a call pre-flop but if we you know if we have a blocker to like all of this value flatting and four betting that's why we're using uh you know A7 off in these spots where you know almost all of our three bets with uh shorter stack sizes uh are going to be using asex uh the the three bet Bluffs are going to come from asex and King X just because of how well we uh we block continues let's look at another example so under the gun raises we're on the button uh let's look at our three bad Bluffs it's Ace 10 off King jack off and then these acex suited King nine king eight King six King five King four um these job these hands just do such a great job of blocking these are the continues of the uh the under the gun player with with that Ace blocker we're blocking this whole region here King blocker we're blocking all of this region in here which is like you know a massive part of the continuing range and then Additionally you know when you have a shorter spr and you get flatted with an ace or a king just those cards can make high card hands uh that you know will be good at Showdown some percentage of the time if they hit their pair you know a decent percentage of the time when they hit their when they hit their pair so you know blockers are blockers are very important um we're going to go back to the example I had at the very beginning before the webinar started so I was playing this uh tournament last week Hunter big blinds deep under the gun raises week three bet nines on the button it's queen queen nine five uh flush draw check we see about a third call Jack of Spades check we see that two-thirds call six of clubs uh recreational player just instantly All In first 63 big blinds uh into 77 big blinds and what was fascinating about this hand was pocket nines is only making about four big blinds as a call on the river uh and pocket aces with the Ace of clubs was making 70 big blinds on the river this hand took me a long time uh you know I ended up folding and I I just thought it was a funny hand because I how much more I wanted to have just like a single pair rather than I did a set in this spot because if we if we take a deeper look at his range like when he shoves this River his value range I think can really only be flushes um I I don't think Queens can shove this River or I don't think Queens will shove this River you know something that recreational players are bad at are getting value are getting thin value so I especially versus Iraq I I don't think that he's going for thin value here with Queens Queen Jack like maybe some King 10 however when he snap shoves like I think I think thinner value hands have to have a decision to make when the board changes so with an instant all in on the club um I think we can rule out like King 10 Queen Jack pocket Queen's pocket Jacks almost 100 of the time and we're basically just looking at AC clubs King High clubs 10 Jack of Clubs and then Bluffs and and we when we look at his bluffing range um his Bluffs have to have some sort of a showdown like he's not going to be calling I can't find any hands that call this hate that call this turn that don't have any Showdown value like he's gonna have Jack X or queen X um at a minimum so we would be turning those hands into a bluff and I don't think he's instantly turning those hands into a bluff because they have Showdown value you know it's a it's a difficult decision to make um and you know when you go back and you look at solver and you look at calling with Aces with the Ace of clubs versus nines no club and you see the difference 70 big lines versus four big blinds um it's just quite wild when we're considering you know a set versus single pair Bluff catching on this River you know this this illustration more than anything should make you understand that it's it's going to be very important uh when you're playing to be considering blockers combinatorics um when you're making decisions or you're just going to be throwing away money um it's it's something that you know you just can't you cannot ignore at some point in your poker uh career or Journey uh you know and I double check this with piyo and I tried to use ranges that I actually thought the recreational player would play facing my big three bet um and Pyle came up with even more of a discrepancy had aces valued at like 90 big blinds um so this is definitely a legitimate uh solution oh yeah here's the piosim same exact spot we have uh Aces showing profit of 93 big blinds you know once again if you're playing 510 93 big blinds it's 930 dollars let's say you only played um let's say you only played 900 or I'm sorry uh 90 hours of 510 in your life that's you know that's ten dollars an hour that's added to your hourly just from this one this one decision point for this one hand um so you absolutely need to be thinking about these things um okay some quick uh some quick examples here's some good ones under the gun raises we flat the button um the solver has us just betting a ton on this flop uh we are only checking 36 percent of the time why does the button bet so much of this hot on this flop well he has popped three combos of pocket fives three combos of pocket sixes three combos of pocket sevens he has four combos of uh eight nine suited he has two combos of five six suited he has two combos of five seven suited he has two combos of six seven Suited and then he has flush draws um he's gonna have a lot of nine ten for back door I'm sorry for gut shot straight draws he's gonna have eight ten Suited so not only does the button have a ton of value but he has a lot of hands uh that have very high Equity that's why you see such a high betting frequency on on a board like this and then you compare and contrast that to a board like a state two under the gun raises button calls you know realistically how many hands does the button have that can see by this board and want to bet three streets um very few right a hand like Ace Queen Ace Jack Ace 10 Ace nine you know doesn't want to bet three streets for large sizing uh versus Under the Gun Range you know when we're talking about three Street Big betting it's going to be a state-suited ace do suited pocket eights pocket twos and we know from earlier they're just not that many combos of those types of hands so that's why you see the button with a very high checking frequency we had 70 close to 70 check on this board from the button versus the hand before was um 36 check um you know and I I didn't I didn't say this but not only does button have a lot of good hands on this flop he has a lot of good hands they're gonna that are going to be able to bet three streets you know all of the hands that I mentioned sets two pairs straights are going to be be able to bet three streets and you know shove big shoves on River on many run outs and you know if draws complete his semi Bluffs will get a bet very large uh on Rivers so whenever you have this you know tons of combos of value uh and in addition tons of tons of um draws High Equity draws that could have bet a very large you'll see a larger betting frequency on the Flop that's why you see so much of this you know random King jack off king queen off being it's that's such a high frequency it's jack off King 10 suited Queen tent Suited you know Queen nine suited all these hands get to bet because it's you know this range is backed up with uh with so much strength and you don't you just don't get that on on a say two all right thank you guys for viewing um I hope you guys uh have success at the tables", metadata={'source': 'wanA_Cz6cbM', 'title': 'Combinatorics & How To USE THEM!

[Document(page_content="today we will be talking about small blind versus big blind tournament play it's gonna be mostly a pre-flop video I will have some discussion about how to play flops but I figure in these short amount of times when we only have about 30 minutes of content pre-flop is the easiest and quickest way to shore up some leaks and as I've said before in the past getting a solid pre-flop fundamental studying of knowledge of a situation is what's going to help you set up yourself for better flop play better turn play if you have a problem like you realize oh I don't have any strong hands on the turn or I'm over folding turns or Rivers it's most likely because you're screwing up on the Flop or pre-flop earlier on and that's where your mistake comes in is earlier streets not the current street that you're on so today's webinar came from a student I asked on Twitter it's just how I'm unsure how to play pre-flop when it is folded to me in the small blind should I be raising should I be limping how do I construct ranges when it's folded to me in the small blind what adjustments do I make on different stack sizes and as always all examples will assume a one big blind Annie so as always all these examples are going to assume a one big blind ante because we play 95 of the tournament with ents so I'm not going to bother looking at the non-andy stuff non-annies you're going to be obviously playing much tighter and so you can kind of make your own adjustments from there and we'll be focusing a lot on the small blind play and we'll talk a little bit about big blind but that's a whole other topic so first things first when you're in the small blind you're in the worst position at the table the big blind isn't the worst position the small blind is the worst position you're forced to put money into the pot only a half a big blind compared to one big blind and the big blind but you're now out of position to everyone at the table and when you call and play a hand you're given a really good price to the big blind so you're most likely playing multi-way pots out of position to multiple people so it is the worst position at the table playing wide ranges at a very large spr is very difficult spr again from our previous one is stack to pot ratio and the wire to the ranges are the larger the spr is the more the big line gets to screw with you and it's fun when you're the big blind and it sucks when you're the small blind because you get up get punished and if you're the big blind you get to do the punishing so optimal strategies change dependent on a few variables the most important two that we'll focus on is one who is the big blind and two how deep stacked or shallow stacked are we so those are the two most important variables you watch my shows in the past I kind of give you Baseline strategies and then we adjust it based on the variables so keep that in mind let's look at the first one who is the big blind this is the most important piece of information that you're going to have that will help determine what your strategy should be and your strategy really is going to be different versus every single big blind player do they fold too much to raises do they call optimally these are the first questions you should be asking yourself how aggressive post-flop are they will they put you in tough situations and to go along with that how well do they play against continuation bets do they overfold or underfold so each of these questions that we're asking is going to lead to a exploitable adjustment that we're going to make from our Baseline ranges so do they fold too much to raises or do they call optimally well if they're they're not defending their big blind enough we're going to raise is more and steal their big wine more or if they overcall well if they overcall they call too many hands from the big blind it's kind of the same exploit as if they fold too much they're just going to have a weaker range post flop and now you get to exploit them post-flop so knowing how what type of ranges they defend from their big blind is very important talked about that in past webinars how aggressive do they play post Swap this is really important the more aggressive they are post-flop and the tougher you know I told you that the big blind really gets to abuse the small blind in these blind verse blind situations so how much they take advantage of that will determine your the type of strategy you want to use from the small blind so if they're putting you in tough situations you know you're going to have to probably stick to these Baseline strategies more and if they aren't putting you in any tough situations if they play very fit or fold you can really get creative and really just try to exploit and play a lot of pots in the small line if they're not going to be putting those in the right situations how well do they play against continuation bets obviously the two most frequent actions we're going to have here is we're either going to be limping or raising from the small blind and then seeing a flop and how they play against continuation bets will have a big factor on our win rate from the small blind if they're over folding underfolding how often they raise your continuation bets basically how tough are they making your life so these all these questions are kind of connected and this is why the type of questions you want to be asking about the line to determine how much you want to adjust your strategy from our Baseline stack sizes when we're playing a hundred big blinds or deeper with an ante our standard strategy is going to be no raising and we're going to be limping about 90 to 93 percent of hands basically you're limping all your hands except you're folding like seven Deuce off nine Deuce off Deuce 5 off basically the really bad off suit hands are what we're going to be folding and you'll see that later in the ranges we're gonna be doing no raising and then we're going to have a linear limp re-raising range and when you're playing 100 big blinds deep with an ante you're getting a great price so you're in the small blind there's one and a half big Wines in the pot from the blinds plus the Andy so there's two and a half you're getting five to one on your money you have to call a half a big blind to win two and a half big blinds so you're getting a really good price so you want to be playing most of your hands and in order to kind of protect our rage and protect the big blind abusing us we're going to be limping some strong hands and then when we get isoed then we're gonna kind of hit them with this linear limp re-raising range and we're going to protect ourselves at this high spr and also limp erasing this range is going to lower the spr post Swap and reduce our post swap Edge against these opponents at 50 big ones or less we're going to have a raising range now because the spr is going to be lower as we talked about in Prior webinars now the spr is lower so our offsuit Broadways and hands that can make good top pairs go up a ton in value and the out of position disadvantage is negated because of that lower spr so here's kind of the first range we're going to look at this range is a linear limpy raising range of what we're going to have deep stacked against a good opponent so this is kind of our Baseline strategy here as I said before you know I have us fold in about 12 13 so about 88 percent of hands but basically all you need to know here is like these white hands are the hands that will be folding so these 10 new saws a lot of these weak offset Deuces and officer threes these are the types of hands that we're going to be folding all these hands are going to be limped the red ones are going to be our limp re-raises the blues are the limp folds and the green are the limp calls so as you can see we're playing a ton of hands the main reason is we don't want to inflate the pot we're getting such a good price pre-flop that we're going to protect our range and in order to play all these hands we want to be limping our stronger hands are well so we're limping kind of the top 90 percent of hands so we're going to be doing a linear limp free raising range of around like 12 percent ish of and it's basically like nines plus Ace Jack plus all the student Broadways and suited connectors and some of these two to one gappers all these hands play it very well at Deep stacks and this is kind of going to be our linear limp pre-raising range say you limp the small big blind isos to three and a half big blinds we're going to be looking at somewhere of around a four to four and a half times the the raise uh limp erase uh we're doing lots of Limp calling with this green as you can see all different types of hands we got some Aussie dases all these suited Aces we got all of the smaller pocket pairs through the Kings basically the only hands we're going to be folding are these junkier off-suit high low hands like King five Queen five Queen four those are gonna be our limp Folds um and this is a big part here and this is why we're going to be making a lot of there's a few only a few situations you're gonna be playing this strategy kind of like this because this assumption is based off of your opponent is isoing from the big blind of around 40 percent and most players are not doing that they're not isoing wide enough but again like I said this is our base strategy of what we kind of want to be doing um against you know a good opponent and now I'm actually going to skip a slide so let's look at this one so this is kind of a big blind response at a optimal kind of level of what you want to be doing against a small blind limp at 100 big blinds so you limp you just call the small line and the big blind raises to four big blinds so in theory here when you're in the big blind you kind of want to be raising versus a limp about 40 percent and as you can see when we go through these these are all tournament situations when we look at this range I want the main reason I have this range up and this slide is I want people to realize how like tight most people are ISO raising from the big blind and how they really just check back way too often against a small blind limp so um if we look up the uh the raising rage here in the red this is kind of like a pretty standard range which I think would be like 27 and especially once we take out these crap your Suitor hands and stuff you know sevens plus just kind of this value range is really only going to be about 20 percent of hands so I feel like the your average opponent that you're going to be seeing um from the big blind is probably only going to be isoing somewhere around 20 of the time versus the limp and the example I kind of wanted to point out here is these blue hands and to get to that like 40 number that this big blind probably should be isoing there's a lot of hands here that they need to be raising like 25 percent of the time I'm not saying that you want to raise King 4 off suit um every single time but there's just so many hands they need to be isoing in terms to be the small blind to make limping 100 not um optimal we have this range against the good opponents I want to look more so this range now is what a lot of you are probably going to be used to and this is kind of I wanted to show that bass range of the linear limp I wanted to show that linear limp erasing range and now we're going to kind of look at this small blind play versus a weak opponent so this is the average probably range you're going to want to be using and it's quite different now um because the big blind is not going to be ISO raising enough against our limps we don't really have as much incentive to be trapping with our big hands so the two differences in these ranges is that here in this range we're going to be limp erasing a ton because we're assuming that the big blind is going to be raising a lot so against a very aggressive big blind player that's going to raise your limp a lot this is the type of range you want to do and in this range you're limping all these hands versus against a weak opponent who's not going to be raising your limps wide enough we want to be doing this and we're going to be doing a lot less limping we're raising all the hands in red to about three and a half to four times the big blind and it's basically a linear raising range we're raising the top 24 of hands here in this range that I have so basically all pairs student connector suited one gappers and all are like suited eights are better in Ace nine offer better in the red the green are all going to be limps so remembering a variety of a lot of suited stuff um and like big card high lows type of stuff we're still not fully much we're still folding that bottom 10 of kind of crappy hands pre-flop and then these blue hands are going to be the hands that we limp fold against the limps and the green hands are going to be hands that we limp call against the weaker opponent you're still playing about 90 of hands um one note here exploit that's kind of cool I saw Jonathan post a poll on this that a lot of people got wrong so if your opponent is folding over 50 of the time when you race from the small blind you can raise with any two cards two three times the big blind so it folds you in the small blind you have to put in two and a half big blinds to make it three times the big blind arrays and you're risking two and a half to win the two and a half big blinds in the pot so when you put in two and a half to win two and a half has to work fifty percent of the time and if your opponent doesn't defend the top 50 of their hands you instantly make money and you're making money because even when they call say they call exactly fifty percent of the time you're still going to win the pot with your jack five off suit you know 20 of the time when they do call so paying attention against these really tight opponents you can even expand this red range even way more and start raising a ton of hands in the small blind if they're playing way too tight you can and in some cases you might even want to be raising a hundred percent of hands because your opponent is not going You're Gonna Be instantly making money because they fold too much um and one more exploit I want to talk about that I see from a lot of players that is not correct is people love to limp like aces in the small blind as like their hand to trap with and it's actually I don't think that is correct you don't want to be trap limping with aces in the small blind because the most common hands that your opponents are going to be raising and trying to steal your blind with is your hands like your suited Aces and their Ace X if your opponent's too tight those are the first hands they're going to go to to isolate you when you limp and so by limping Aces when you have two Aces they're automatically not going to be raising enough because you have two of the aces in your hands so it'd be better to trap with a hand like pocket kings or pocket Queens because then you don't have an a it's more likely the big blind has an ace in their hand and they're going to raise more often and you're going to be able to um get that limp raise in more so two things to note here one if your opponents are folding way too much it can be profitable to even raise with any two cards from the small blind and two don't limp trap with Aces because you block the range that you want them to be raising you with and so here we're making it like 4X on the small blind with this wide linear range and then we have this weaker limping range versus against a good opponents we're going to be limping everything and doing a linear limp reuse against them so this all depends on how often the big blind is going to be um raising against your limp um now we're going to look a little bit at the uh shallow stock play versus good opponents so this is at like 40 big blinds and again this is against good opponents so this is kind of our Baseline strategy and this Baseline strategy here is so now the we're playing at a lower s spr because the uh there's not Stacks aren't as deep so we're a lot happier to raise more hands and play more pots post flop the types of hands we want to raise or we're going to be playing these a lot of these offshoot Broadway hands now are going to become raises a lot of these student Broadways um all these red hands basically are becoming raises and the limp calling range is still kind of similar a lot of the suited stuff Hi-Lo we have A6 off A7 off King seven off and we're going to be limp folding a decent amount but the one thing I want to note here is that we have a few more limp traps now we're kind of mixing in um we're going to be limp trapping some of these big suited Aces big off suit Aces and some of our Middle Lane pocket pairs so what I was talking about before now we're going to be limping hands like Queens through eights but we're going to be Raising Kings and Aces for that same reason that I'd rather limp trap with pocket jacks or pocket Queens because then we allow our opponent to have ace5 off suit raise it up with the ace5 off suit and then we get a put in the limp Rays with queens or jacks or tens these Middle Lane pairs to limp rays and then get all the money in for 40 big blinds um if you're playing against an opponent that is not going to be raising enough from the big blind all these green hands up here all become raises now we're not going to be having any limp traps against an opponent that plays way too tight um we're just we don't really need to protect our range against them so we just go back to this against the 40 big blind play becomes basically this range again it's almost the same as the uh the 40 big blind range against a weak opponent basically becomes similar to The 100 big blind range from the um this against the weak opponent so um the number one mistake that players are making from the small blind is that they are not raising enough from the small blind and they try to trap too much so these hands like king queen off king queen suited pocket aces Ace Queen Ace King players are limping those hands too much and not getting value from those hands whether they're deep stacked or shallow stacked against weak opponents and against most opponents you just want that are like weaker players that aren't going to put you in tough spots you just want to be taking this you know raising like the top 20 to 25 percent of hands taking these pocket pairs to the connectors raising it up to four times the big blind and forcing your opponent to make a mistake either in that they're not going to defend enough or now you're getting value out of those bigger hands and I think that's the correct play and then limping this green range here that's going to be your biggest exploit probably against a lot of the opponents that you guys are going to be playing against is raising up all this red range limping the green and not worry about balance or anything like that being balanced doesn't matter much against these weak opponents I show you the ranges you want to play against good opponents because I think you need to know that Baseline in order to be able to make understand the adjustments and just realizing that no one really is Raising enough hands this range here being the big blind response to the small blind limp this range here is like 36 percent of hands and so this is what I'm trying to get at here if I'm playing in the big blind I'm going to be raising all of these red hands plus like 25 percent of the time I need to be raising up these hands like Queen six off Queen five off King five off Jack four suited Jack three suited Jack do student like all these hands I need to be raising and no one is Raising those hands enough and so this is kind of another counter exploit is when you're the big blind playing against small blinds that limp people on the big blind do not ISO raise enough um um someone and I I should probably uh point this out that these are all situations where it's a heads up pot now between the small blind and the big blind and so the other exploit being when you're in the big blind facing when the small block it falls to the small blind and they limp in is that people are not ISO raising enough to three and a half four times the big blind against a small blind limp and these are the types of hands you need to be raising um to punish that small blind to make sure they're not getting into play you don't want them to play all those ninety percent of hands um you're gonna there's a lot of money they're limping in with 90 of hands they're going to be doing a lot of Limp folding and you should be punishing them with raises to steal those limps and we're doing it with a lot of these lower suited cards obviously all our strong value hands but these blue hands this is kind of where you want to be start mixing it in and um the reason some of these hands like king deuce offsuit or even like a hand like let's take a hand like uh six three off suit why it's a good hand to raise up against a small blind limp and the reason like I hand like six three off suit um is a good hand to raise sometimes uh I have it in here as like 25 of the time the reason 6-3 off suit can be a good hand to raise is because when you raise it up let's look at that range that is folding against your uh limp so this is the range that we were going to play as the small blind when we raise six three off suit now they're folding King six off to Queen six off suit Jack six off suit ten six nine six and then now they're folding hands like Ace three King three Queen three so we get all those hands that are you know six three is obviously a really poor hand and doesn't have much equity and doesn't play well post flop but now we get all these hands to fold that had us dominated post-flop so when we do raise and they call our outs are normally more live we're less likely to be dominated with the 6-3 offsuit and a lot of the time they're just going to be folding when we raise it up so that's why these kind of high low hands like 10-3 off we get them to fold hands like that Ace three King three are gonna fold when we raise and then they're also going to fold hands like 10 6 off suit 10-5 off suit and ten four off suit so the adjustment here the exploit that I think a lot of players are not making is they don't raise enough from the big blind when the small blind limps into the pot um pretty much at all stacked UPS so that's the adjustment that you kind of want to be making from the big blind versus a small blind limp so we've kind of looked at a couple of different um exploits you could be making versus players when you're playing in the small blind knowing how often your player is Raising from the big blind and that kind of determines what your strategy is from the small blind in terms of what hand you want to limp and what hands you want to raise and um also from the big blind pretty much across the board a lot of people are not raising enough in the big line what you guys should be taking out of this webinar is making sure you're raising enough from the big blind when it folds to the small blind and they limp into the pot and also learning how to identify who the opponent is in the big blind and knowing how aggressive they're going to isolate your limps and against the very aggressive players you want to be playing a more limping everything strategy and then be limp re-raising more and keep in mind when I say link breathing more that doesn't mean just with like Ace King and Jax or better you're gonna be doing it with some suited connectors you're suited Broadways you know hands like Queen 10 suited um and against the weaker players that are not isolated enough you're going to be playing more doing a lot more raising than most people do about 25 percent of hands and that is um probably a lot less hands than most people are raising currently or are not and I know this blind verse spline play stuff is can get pretty complicated it's a very tough situation like I said early on because Stacks are very large and you have are forced to play a lot of hands from the big blind and the small blind it is one of the toughest positions to play in poker in one of the toughest situations to play in poker and so kind of taking a look at these ranges studying them seeing what the difference are seeing where you're too tight or too loose is really important to learning how to improve your win rate from either of the positions in the blinds and just kind of increasing your overall Roi in tournaments because blind play is just really important and I think it's one of the areas where you can exploit people the most um take a couple minutes here to talk about post-flop stuff um like I said it's kind of a completely different topic so we're not going to go into it too much but the basics so when we're playing a hundred big blinds um we're going to talk about this against like kind of a good opponent when we're playing 100 big blinds we're limping all these hands we have a hundred percent of hands and let's say it goes limp and then the person checks if they check we can kind of remove like no one's really checking back these Broadway hands like king queen off King jack off all these Broadway hands so at a lot of so a deep SEC when it goes limping to check behind any hands with like two Broadway cards on the board or even one Broadway card um we can almost bet at a very very high frequency um but when the low cards come on the boards like these five four threes or seven five Deuce when there's no Broadway cards um those are cards are more likely to hit the big blind because they didn't raise pre-flop now um it's kind of the opposite now when we get back to the 40 big blinds when we play shallow stack now we're raising up all these Broadway hands so at 40 big lines look at the types of hands we're raising King 10 are better a lot of these suited Broadway hands so when it limps if we limp into the small blind and it goes if we check now we don't have as many of the Broadway hands in our range because we raise those hands pre-flop and so the actually the lower boards become a little bit better for us because we have a lot of the lower hands in our range Now versus when we raise we want to see the Broadway cards on the board those are going to be our best boards to continuation bet um and in general in in these situations blind verse blind um these ranges are super wide for both the small blind and the big blind um you can be playing doing a lot of checking out a position and Don't Be Afraid don't be feel committed to like have to continuation bet every single pot would be my biggest advice when you're playing from the small blind and you raise um don't feel that you have the continuation of that every pot um you have a lot of really poor hands in your range and you can be doing a decent amount of checking check calling check raising there's other ways that you can get around playing post swap without just blindly continuation betting every flop and that comes back to our you know who is the big blind the first question we ask and how they react to the the how do they react to continuation bets how do they react to you know pre-flop ranges and just learning looking at these boards it's you know if you look at these ranges you start to learn what kind of flops are good for me to bet what kind of flops should I be checking and just figuring out how your range interacts with the board is the most important part", metadata={'source':

[Document(page_content="hello sharks I am here with just GTO Justin Bieber say hello Justin hey everybody Justin is the master of GTO and um well I am not so he is gonna go through a few of these very very very intricate difficult spots in biosolver and we are going to see what the optimal play is so let's get right to it so these are all gonna be from um the US Poker Open that we both played you played more than I did um a few months ago and I just found these four hands pretty interesting uh so ran it through piyo and we can start going through it so pocket aces here we go pretty good hand you raise it up and bury three bets here so what does your strategy look like facing a three bet um about 45 big blinds deep here so he goes kind of big right I make it 90 makes it 35 and I guess I'm supposed to just start shoving with some stuff like kings queens Jacks Ace King Ace queen stuff like that um a decent amount of calling calling with Aces for sure I think calling with um suited connected good cards you know just big cards for the most part yeah roughly following GTO charts in this scenario Barry's good strong GTO player I think maybe a little bit on the tighter side probably I mean I don't expect him to be just like running too many Bluffs here but I bet if he looked at a GTO chart he's just going to do what the GTO chart says in the spot yeah as well yeah yeah I think so I think Barry's a pretty strong player yeah um yeah I mean I I like most of what you said in terms of like your strategy I think that when we're in position in this spot versus being out of position you're just gonna call infinitely more right sure um I assume even like your Jacks and queens are going to find some callers in the spot then your kings are going to be the ones that really want to say all in and then Ace is obviously trap um let's look at the pre-flop strategy for this spot yes this was about your calling range here where you actually are going to find a ton of calling even with like a skin type stuff I think most people just say all in yeah if you gave me a hand like Ace King off suitable and literally every time yeah yeah I think that's like pretty normal and against population that's not really really strong I think that's like probably pretty good but you can imagine if somebody's like out of position finding these three bets here it's pretty sick just to like keep them in with their h10 off suit and the spot when you have Ace King right that makes sense yeah you're gonna get to navigate and spot uh pretty well playing it in position so okay you go with the holidays which obviously is great roughly the stacked up the 40 big lines you just don't basically always slow play the aces right for sure no there's definitely some players in the field where I think jamming becomes really good like if you just don't think they have Bluffs out of the big blind here right it's really nice just to stack them right away um so I think this I I I've definitely seen some really good players um just like be all in with Asus here against certain player types that they don't think are bluffing pre that way they just always stack pocket Jacks you know right they always stock a skin but against a player with Bluffs yeah I think it's obviously great to go for the Trap I will say I don't imagine Barry is three betting quite the three betting range you just showed a second ago I think he's probably not finding all those Bluffs right like you you really think it's three bat in a king six suited like no uh yeah pretty unlikely it's not included probably not 10 8 suited probably not so let's let's presume he is missing just some of these three bats okay should we be more inclined to format but still probably not because we just want to keep Ace we just want to slow play hard I think yeah yeah I think it's like a super nitty yeah I agreed agreed as his range gets like more constricted more constricted you should be fast playing more and more but aces are still going to be the one that's going to fast play the least often so maybe your kings just say all in every time and your queen say all in you know 55 of the time instead of uh 30. right but but I still think Aces and even a skin suit you can just say all then right away but then Aces I think soda's trapping is great are your cards here presuming has kind of big three bet size uh yeah it's a 4X size is 4X kind of big 40 big lines deep in the spot or is that just like what we should be doing um so from the big blind like he's not like that polish I think it's fine to use a slightly smaller size um one thing I have been seeing happen in some of these pre-flop simulations is that sometimes it's good to use a really small three bet size and just Target their off suit ASAP or their off suit uh Broadway cards like in this spot you're opening like you know Queen tenno Jack tenno um you know Ace 9-0 and if you use a small three bet size you're really just like targeting those hands um which becomes like pretty efficient as a three bet size if you always think that they're pretty much going to continue like kind of a static range no matter what size you use because it's pretty hard to fold a pair here and it's pretty hard to forward like your suited Broadway so I think a three best size to a smaller size and can be really good against some players um but in general 4X is fine here okay sorry six four four oh by the way I did I I was thinking about this hand that I played against Barry also in this series I know he used a smaller three bet size at some other point where I think it was a very similar spot I think maybe like 27k or something so interesting he's using two different sizes in this scenario okay cool somehow someway anyway go ahead yeah it makes some sense I mean it is what it is I mean yeah I'm telling you I saw it so yeah I know it no it's cool I mean it could people can be really tricky in the spot some berries definitely like a guy who can uh who can be tricky and can um you know make mix it up with bigger size with certain bands thinking that it's really good and it's always Dynamic with Barry we used to play a lot together just like at random wpts especially in cash games and I literally never fold him and yeah especially back in the day back in the day he used to but I feel like he's chilled out a lot yeah yeah I think he just tries to play really well in most cases that's probably it too okay so anyway six four four this is we have the nuts yep he goes for this really tiny best size I think that this is like um I think tiny bets out of position in three of pots in general work really well if you're continuing with the correct range because if we look at what this looks like in the solver it's he's supposed to use like a more of a about 25 pot size and when he goes like 10K into 76 you actually have to call the entire deck right because you're in position here so you're folding one combo which is Queen ten of Hearts right so I get why he went so small because it's it's pretty hard to look at like you know Jack ten of Hearts here and just always continue your hand um do you think that he is doing this exploitatively against me and or against the player pool or do you think he just thinks this is the right GTO play it's hard to say I'm not sure it's always really difficult so I mean it's not that big of like a like the EV difference between using about 25 pot and about you know 10 and 76 here like isn't that much of a difference um but if we think about his range like he does still want some protection when he has the Jacks and the Queens you know if he uses this like about 25 size all of a sudden you get king queen Oda fold which is like we don't really hate you're never really going to Bluff King we know on a future Street very often um and so when you have like tens it's kind of nice to make king queen fold and put money in against like nines through fives um put more money in than just like a tiny bet so yeah I don't know if he's doing it for exploitative reasons or if he thinks it's like the best size to use but so let's go back to the small size I will say something that I basically never do in the spot is race with much of anything yeah it probably makes a small size even better right agreed like if you're just not going to get raised it's almost like you're checking to some extent but getting a little bit of money in the pot yeah yeah I mean I think the eights here I just wouldn't raise yeah and I actually think that against really tiny bits out of position in position raises can be really really good and we'll actually see that in another three bit pot uh that you played against chidwick where raising in position becomes just like really really sick um but yeah it's hard to find raves in the spot um well I mean the hands that should raise are kind of logical right they're the the best hand the hands that are most vulnerable that you're just not folding right yeah Pleasant Bluffs and it's kind of hard to find the Bluffs in this in these scenarios too like I'm ever really raising the king queen off suit or the ace suited or whatever um no you know I'm just not so yeah so I mean that makes them small bat size really good against me yeah yeah I think it's it's totally reasonable yeah okay so I need to raise a little bit more yeah well that's another question do we even need to raise notice how raising is what 17 which is some but not a ton yeah I mean I I think it's good in general like when you have hands that don't that are like On The Fringe of continuing especially like a hand like Jack ten of Hearts like like Jackson of Hearts to me feels really hard to play as a call here not not hard but like if you think he's using a really tiny bit size with a lot of his range I think it is totally reasonable to find some raises here in position because when you raise he just has to continue infinite but you get him to like just look at Ace Queen o and find folds yeah King Jack suit and find some folds so I think in general small raises in position in the spot is like it's pretty reasonable I mean anytime you're facing like a really tiny bit raisin becomes at least an option it seems yeah it's almost like you're facing a check right the tinier the bet the more your range just plays like a track cool so anyway Ace is mostly call yeah call leases every time here literally yeah yeah it's totally reasonable so you call and then we get the eight of spades okay fine yeah he does something interesting here where he goes for a third pop but and what did you think in game when he kind of made this size I am thinking I want to keep him in with all of his Bluffs okay that's my main concern here because he could easily have just like random over cards right and probably not all that many hands that have any Equity I mean I have the Ace of Spades so he blocked most logical flush raw right yeah so I mean I just have super nuts here and I just want to keep them in with everything nice yeah and then and then now would you find some razors with a hand like uh maybe like pocket red pocket nines um yeah I think so I think it becomes more reasonable here because for the same reason now it's just more the words a little bit more coordinated although to be fair it's not like we're so worried about getting outdrawn in these scenarios but the pot's bigger right yeah yeah I know I I I I think all that makes sense to me it's like again like what Bluffs am I finding I mean just just Spades you know yeah it depends if we use a small race size I assume that uh yeah you can only really have an all that all right it goes all in only yeah so if you only have like an all-in here you need Equity when you raise right it's like you're not like you're non-spade nines here makes sense to raise which I think makes sense and then the the king queen and king ten are gonna be flushrolls right no so I'm just Stone air ball Bluffs huh yeah I don't I don't think anybody finds these or needs to find maybe we should be right I mean I would literally never shove all in with the king queen of hearts here but I mean if you tell me it's good I guess I should can you imagine can you imagine no I cannot imagine but it's what it says yeah at a very tiny frequency against somebody who needs to be barreling like you know at correct frequencies this presumes he has all the Bluffs which again he's missing half he's lost pre-flop probably yeah yeah there's no guarantee he's gonna bet it on the turn right yeah now what I will say is in game I think it's pretty hard for people to come about 30 here with much of anything right like your range looks like a lot of pairs in the spot I mean I'm gonna float a slob that with everything I really I promise you I actually would flow with pretty much yeah he has like Queens though like it feels like in game people use the bigger size as Queens a lot more often not a huge size but like about 55 pot but that's 60 pot size um same with like pocket jacks or tens yeah okay it feels unlikely to me that people are like okay let me just like I don't know Target their ace high still it feels like they kind of want to like put more money to pop in that in-game at least I mean it makes sense right so yeah and that's why you see like the tiny size being used with like the Aces and the Ace King still for Value um now so now the solver will still use about 10 pot here and not about 30. so I actually think the berry um if he's doing it with these types of ads is using too big of a size okay yeah yeah I think it's a pretty reasonable strategy overall so you guys get the BET 30 you have the easy pure call here you just hope they need to put all the money in By The River an important Point here is that we saw Kings also just calling as well so like you're really not doing all that concern with Kings nice yeah yeah yeah and queens you know like we just have the super nuts and you really really really want to keep them in yeah for sure and in one concept that we'll see later in in a third pot is that your over pairs with Spade you want to put money in because at deeper Stacks you want to have more equity in general you want to block continues but in this spot it's a lot more shallow stacked and so the raises come from the need for protection okay and so you see like nines right nines are the pair that are like I have a pair that I'm always going broke with but I also need the most protection possible so I'm gonna go all in right look at this by the way and think oh man we're really getting anyone knives but what about when he has Aces kings queens Jacks and the answer is you just lose yeah yeah it's okay to just lose so many players I talk to are like but what about when they have you beat and here he really easily could have us beat right I mean Queens Jacks all the same way maybe yeah so you just lose sometimes yeah yeah absolutely but but once again like we're playing really good players so like we can't yeah I mean you're not going to be deviating like unbelievably far from what you think is good against guys like Barry and chidwick and you know but tarantula and these guys like if you deviate far no matter what you're doing you're gonna be like kind of getting in rough spots in general so a question for people who are playing let's say 3 500 buying wpts against players like Chadwick who decide to go and play those tournaments should they still just be trying to play as close to GTO as possible or should they be trying to make random exploits yeah I mean against like really good players no matter what the field is I would always just be trying to play really well and if anything I would maybe even try to put more pressure on them because chidwick's gonna sit at a 3500 obviously being like one of the best players in the field and he's not like he's he's not going to deviate far but I think the pros when they play in those spots especially really good Pros are much more likely to deviate into a passive realm when they're facing a lot of aggression right from like I don't want to go broke exactly right like they know that the value of the tournament is like much higher than that right because if they go broke they cannot play Future hands with an edge right so they only take a roughly break-even spot yeah yeah exactly okay cool if it's in the re-entry period maybe uh tighten up a little bit but yeah but um yeah they know that yeah yeah exactly we've seen Justin play tournaments he enjoys it I do enjoy a good reach nice little nice little win at the end yeah I asked him if they wanted a battle I uh I was hoping to play out three-handed because you don't get you don't get to play out three-handed that often so I wanted to play but they were all like come on let's go home but they didn't want to flash me just chopped it up all right rivers and eight we still have the nuts yeah and so he checks here I mean just all in right yeah yeah I think your decision is easy it's it's more interesting to me in terms of what his strategy is here because like you're going online for like 70 pot so it's pretty what which date was it eight of diamonds it's a pretty rough spot for him so he himself is going to be jamming his pairs mixing his Kings and Aces um so he doesn't really have very many good hands when he tracks so he does not have many really good vegetable checks exactly and so when he jams you just have to call your Pairs and you have to call your good Aces and when I say good Aces I mean you're good block erases right like like obviously you're Ace 10 of Spades is a much better Bluff catcher than Ace Queen of Diamonds because he's going to Bluff with the Queen of Diamonds and sand at some frequency um and so having the 10 of Spades in your hand is a better Bluff catcher than than like Ace jackpack but yeah you're not really phoning a pair or anything and then first is check I think a lot of people may look at this and say you're really just calling it off with the ace high the answer is yes because he has a lot of well in theory he should have a lot of Bluffs I will say again if he's missing a lot of those low or like middle connected suited tight pans maybe we should start folding a little bit more yeah yeah and also an adjustment like from like if he thinks you're a station he might never Bluff Queen Jack on the river that's true if he knows me and I can literally call every time he should probably yeah yeah and so I mean you have to adjust that in game because like if if people think you're a station in these spots and they don't Bluff and then you call it correct frequencies you're torching that's the tough thing though because there's always this fine line when you're playing as good players like are they just trying to play GTO or do they actually think I'm just a station I'm gonna call them every time yeah I don't know yeah that's that's the meta you have to figure out but but I mean for the most part I would I would say pretty close to what you think is like really good strategies yeah um but yeah there's definitely going to be spots where where you're gonna have to overfold especially on the river even against the best players in the world sure okay so anyway he well we're obviously I'm shopping or checking on the river right we're not doing any tiny better yeah no no tiny bits allowed in these spots it's actually from the Eternal masterclass we looked at the spot a lot on the River where whenever you have two-thirds pot or even pot a lot of time you're just not going small position yeah yeah so what should we be bluffing with is my question because obviously the pairs all get to shove let's see all the pairs of seven shop yeah seven shops which is interesting yeah like how bad can we sell for Value right yeah I'm kind of surprised seven shelves that feels maybe a little bit I guess if he shows better pairs exactly there's this spot where I would deviate really hard in a field where like I think people aren't shoving enough out of position here like if they're not shoving Jacks obviously it's torch to shove sevens but I really think that they're just going to shove Jacks and try to stop gear sevens um right and so if they're shoving all their over pairs it's like you're just targeting X High on the river and so all your pairs are worth um worth a shot here except for fives and even five shops a little bit okay so then for our Bluffs we're basically taking our Panza lack Showdown value in the spot right because a lot the rest of our hands are like ace high that have Showdown value and King Heights it's a little bit interesting here because one thing that we see happen is when you're facing a range it's so weak you actually get to shove and fold them off chops which is cool so you obviously have your king Jack and your king Jack if you floated uh turn it's like your best bluffing candidate right your queen Jack of spade has to block your queen 10 your jack ten so like anything's not ace high pretty much has to Bluff except for your worst blockers like team 10 of uh the King High Spades aren't great yeah if we look at that like your king eye Spades and your a-size Spades always check and why are they checking is it just purely because of Showdown value or are those cards that block some of his folds exactly yeah but it's one of the I'm not actually sure which one it is is it it's going to be the second you're King highs I don't think I have much shown about you but if that's the case then why is the queen High bluffing Spades too well with the queen High unblocks his king of high speeds okay okay and so your queen highs get his King eyes to fold okay so there's like a more a higher benefit of it right so it's not necessarily Showdown value today there are more hands available that you can make fold exactly okay exactly yeah when you have the King of Spades you get to show down versus queen tent of Spades right but when you have the queen High Spades um you end up losing to his King eye okay cool and so yeah you get a shove your Ace King and stuff as just pillage photomath chops once again I think I would have shoved a skin here that would have been yeah yeah I think it's I think that's pretty reasonable to check that one back like I know I would have bluffed a lot of the non-showdown value hands right yeah queen queen high and lower for sure just because like in this spot I realize I don't have any of those really so when you have them you probably just want to Bluff them yeah yeah I think that makes sense um I probably would have checked just like all the ace high and to be fair it doesn't look like that's that big of a punt yeah no that's totally reasonable I'm not sure if I win a dream seven I mean I always look at these boss and ask like what would I have done wrong you know yeah because you want to try to play better right so yeah those response where I would have played slightly wrong and if you're watching this video you know ask yourself would you have played roughly like this and if you're in my mind if you're playing roughly like this you're gonna be fine but yeah it's something like checking jacks or something then you're blundering right yes okay yes I totally agree or if you're finding zero gloves right sure sure yeah that's something else a lot of people do wrong okay sorry we have an easy shop yeah so we found the shove it and he has to just mix his Ace King which is what happened in game I don't know how quickly he called this spot but forever yeah yeah I assume so it's a hard spot um and he called the Ace King of Diamonds and as you can see here like a king of diamonds calls about two-thirds of the time yeah and so yeah I mean he he played this close to correct and and uh and you played this perfectly and you got a nice double up early so yeah that was just an interesting hand um through that Potch facing really tiny sizes and then a weird spot on the River where um yeah you just get to go really thin and Target is A5 so why is A7 an ace why is a seven calling every time yeah so H7 isn't blocking any Bluffs whereas Ace King o is gonna block your king Jack non-spin Bluffs King 10 non-spade gloves so it's all about the second card not interacting with your Bluffs gotcha and the Seven does not interact at all and all the ace hives are the same exactly so you find the caller okay cool all right next hand yeah that's a fun one um this one was versus Brewer I'm sure you remember this this was an interesting one this is Chris Brewer he gets in there he battles hard yeah he has to play pretty GTO but I get the vibe he takes basically Every Blessed body possibly can at least Against Me Maybe things like to be fair he thinks I call every time too because I call literally every time and he shows me the nuts every time that's surprising he doesn't show much to that many people no I've I have seen the nuts like usually back door nuts or something he showed me 700 times in a row anyways here we go and I know he's doing it with non-nuts so I just like keep calling you know yeah yeah for sure yeah I think in general he just he is super aggressive tries to play really well that is interesting uh mindset flaw I think a lot of people have is they're planning on someone who they know gets in there and battles hard but they just happen to be shown the nuts against them four times in a row and you gotta realize loose aggressive battling players are gonna have the nuts sometimes yeah and don't think that they're just not bluffing you just they probably haven't had the bluffing opportunity a few times that you happen to play with each other because it's not like you have a big sample with anybody yeah for sure I mean some of my friends um you know thought for a period of time that I was just like super out of line aggressive especially like these types of fields and I am I am very aggressive but I was but I also had to remind them that like look I'm just trying to play good strategies and it just so happens that in live terms you don't get to play that many hands and I just had the bluffing candidates for like the last six hands yeah so it looks like I'm going crazy because I haven't had value but it's such a tiny sample um and if I get value six times in a row and they think I'm crazy and they adjust I'm going to be crushing them right so yeah it's a funny thing yeah deviating especially in small samples especially in live poker like you just don't get to play that many spots right all right so here we flop flush Raw I suppose we just bet small and frequently yeah yeah so that if if you were at a little bit of a shorter stock I think you would increase your betting frequency but he actually has a lot more flushes here and so like really deep sprs I think you need to find some tracks does he have a lot more flushes here yeah yeah think about how much of the deck he's defending well he's blocking the board blocks a lot of them well yeah yeah but um when you're comparing the flushes you have all the ASI flushes he has all the ASI flushes you have maybe like King five of diamonds and better he has all the King five dollars you have maybe like Queen seven or eight of diamonds he has all the diamonds you have 10 eight of diamonds he has all the ten diamonds I suppose my range is substantially tighter than his yeah yeah exactly therefore proportionately don't I have more flushes and flush not flush draws right proportionally speak does that matter this proportions yeah I know it does for sure it's like yeah he has all of them but he has all the other junk too yeah no I mean so you are right you have a big Equity advantage throughout but I think that the reason why you developed tracks let me make sure you develop tracks first so I'm not just yeah okay so here we're betting small 70 67 yeah and so I'm sure I think that's fine I mean that's that's roughly right yeah and I think that what happens here oh okay I think that what happens is you are right unfortunately you do have more flushes you have six percent of flushes um yeah six point five percent flushes but mine are better okay he does have more flushes but mine are better years are better um but if you start betting your entire range he just gets to polarize around his flushes and then over fold the Flop a ton and you have a huge portion of your range that's like you have way more good top pair you have way more good over pairs um well so when I say best frequently I don't mean like that 100 or anything but to be fair I probably would have bet like every Aces here I just I would have and yeah I would definitely check some stuff like top pair marginal kicker Like You Know Jack 10 10 9 yeah stuff like that I think like The Logical hands I would have checked I would have basically done what the tournament masterclass had to do which would have been use such a mixed strategy here I guess all the bets are coming with diamonds are almost entirely diamonds right yeah exactly this is kind of a fun spot where it well actually no it's mixing all that up as well look yeah so what I was going to say is it's kind of a fun spot where like it's the opposite of The Last Hand where your nines with no Spade one and two bet for protection but in this spot you're really deep and so your Aces with a diamond want to put money in the pot because they have a lot easier time defending verse check raises and aggression and then you're balancing your strategy out with single Diamond hands um it can easily call some streets so you have like like tens with a diamond let's see I assume 10's no diamond checks a lot a queen with a diamond so I mean you have to have high Diamonds the check back right so you can call a lot of turns presumably exactly yeah okay and it is it is pretty mixed throughout someone spots like this where you know it's pretty mixed throughout what do you do when trying to play well I just try to mix all my hands at a reasonable frequency yeah because that's basically what it's doing to some extent you're gonna be off by a little bit here and there yeah yeah I mean it sounds like this where you know it bets two-thirds of the time with almost everything you just bet two thirds of the time well I mean for my specific hand it's like if I have Asia with a diamond here I'm going to be really inclined to just bet pure like myself where I don't know Ace of Diamonds Ace of Spades that's 100 though but I know I'm supposed to bet these spots about two-thirds of the time what can you do or nothing study more um well it's gonna be it doesn't mean like I'm telling you what I probably would have done here I would have checked back a lot of the top hair bad kickers and middle pairs that's mostly what I would have checked back and I would have checked back some like Ace of Diamonds X some portion of the time and some King of Diamonds at some portion of the time yeah that like everything else yeah yeah I I think that's going to be pretty fine just in general here's one good concept that I see in these spots that I think everybody can use is that the bigger the gap between your two cards that are flushes the more they typically bet and so like your King five diamonds here is gonna bet almost pure where's your king queen of diamonds finds more checks your Ace two of diamonds is gonna bet almost pure your Ace King of die a lot of checks and the reason for that is the bigger the Gap the more flushes your opponent can have that you cool with um and so I would utilize that Concept in game where like when you have a king five just about cure and then when you have the Ace King of Diamonds maybe trap Brewer right because he's going to be check raising a lot with the age of the Kingdom diamonds in his hand and so when you have both it's kind of nice to let it go check check and just let him develop uh certain Bluffs okay cool so yeah that's that's one thing I'd look for so you go for 30 for that which is great because and we get the four of Spades so what's your rough strategy in this spot oh I don't know man um so in spots like this if I am betting I want to make sure I can reasonably call a raise right I'm not trying to bet and fold yeah so that's important I think so is this a hand we need to bet I don't know I mean I think it's a reasonable hand to consider tripling if I feel inclined I mean I'd rather have a son with a with a brick ax I think than a king right because what would be a brick okay so one of the things that's nice about the king is that you're unblocking all of his like middling cards that would continue to flop so if we look at it so if we look at like that 30 call Four of space no is he showing everything yeah yeah he definitely can't lead you some people think it's just a randomly lead in these spots I just want to show like it just doesn't lead no huh yeah you're still crushing him in terms of equity even though he's viewing hands on YouTube so often on three flush boards people just lead I'm like what are you doing it's just not good and they do it all the time it's interesting you're actually not so yeah these spots are so funny so you're actually you do lose the range Advantage but he just check raises so many of his knots on the flop like if we look at how diamonds play look like it's the same concept as the big gap when you have a big gap you raise more out of position so there's Ace two of diamonds almost purees King two of diamonds heavy rays and then as you Trend to a higher second card you do less raising and so like oh he's just like so hard to implement they're like look the random eight raises eight of X dime eight of diamonds X of diamonds raises but ten doesn't it's like come on man exactly only eight does it's hard to implement this stuff yeah yeah what am I doing in the spot like I don't know because I don't know because look at the strategy I can implement this so I think that I think that it's pretty reasonable to implement and say that okay like my best raises like my best race candidates I'm going to raise at a very high frequency so just like always you know the random eight is the one they're doing that does it compared to the ten you know because they're both gut shots or they both have a straight blocker and I get that the eight has more reason for protection but yeah I actually think what one thing that happens and one thing that's happening in this spot is that when you have the eight you can make one straight flush besides the H6 which is the Ten of diamonds whereas when you have the ten uh no you can't make two trying to think there has to be some there's no answer no there's always an answer there's always an answer there's something I better set the eight needs more protection particularly a call Protection whatever you want to call it anyway anyway let's not get bogged down on this tiny Point here okay there is a reason Justin has to be the answer that's how you get really good at poker I'll find the answer later and I'll I'm a little bit quicker to just say I don't know what's happening in this spot as long as I bet something and play reasonably enough it's going to be okay yeah which is probably why I'm not one of the top five poker players in the world and uh you know Justin just might be there in a big show but maybe one day yeah okay so anyway turn comes four Spades I mean I gotta presume we're supposed to be betting some diamonds right yeah yeah and I think the Ace King let's look at the Ace King I'm curious so you're a pretty heavy bet yeah for the best exercise with some checking if you know you can bet it and not fold it you should just bet it whereas if you have a hand like um I don't know find a do we even have any offsuit hands they don't have a pair yeah like so you're eight you're h10o with the Ten of diamonds is an interesting like difference here which one's better your Ace King or h10 and in this spot your Ace King is better uh with the ace of diamonds rather than your Ace 10 with the Ten of diamonds same thing with having the King of Diamonds your hand and I think that's yeah I think it's because you're just blocking more continues right but like the other ten of diamonds is just worse but it has Equity yeah I don't want to bet any draw called quote-unquote Draw that has decent Equity but would have to fold to a raise yeah with the 10 of diamonds probably has to follow which sucks yeah yeah I totally agree I think it's totally reasonable my thought process I don't know if it's actually right but yeah no I like that I think that's I think that's good and then in terms of you like your over pairs in the spot it's the same thing we kind of talked about before where now your red Aces and this or your you know Ace snow diamond in the spot it really doesn't want to get check raise on its own right like you're just playing too deep that you really don't want to put much money in and you just get to call so many River bets and induce Bluffs um that makes it pretty nice and so when you have the ace of diamonds like King which you have in this hand you're taking away all of the ace of diamonds that would continue from your opponent which is weighting them a little bit to having a lot of more just like Pairs and so you see that like all these have the ace of diamonds in their hand and so if you're blocking this entire section of hands they're going to have them in hand there's the opponent's Edge right they're gonna have way more just like Jack nine seven and so making them fold just like black nine six suit is pretty sweet for you I think something else a lot of people do wrong here is they think they want to be betting all their races because they really don't want to get outdrawn simple as that but that's not necessarily a good play because like you said you do get to call on a lot of rivers yeah yeah for sure for sure to be fair there's a lot of bad Rivers where if they bet the river you don't love it but that's just okay because you really don't want to get check raised agreed you really don't want to get Chuck rates which should happen about 12 of the time and you also kind of keep them in with a bunch of stuff that's drawing almost dead right like look at all the hands when you bet he's folding he's folding A7 King seven Queen seven nine six nine five like these hands have such little Equity against your Black Aces that it's kind of nice to keep them in there and then go for value on the river um win Shack too A lot of times as well also some of their flush draws may feel inclined to Bluff the River Falls right which you can just easily call for sure for sure so it's almost like you have to weigh these two things which is worse the times where you bet the turn to get raised or the times where you check check and then get a crown on the river agreed agreed yeah I think I think tracking is really nice so you go with the check which I think is totally fine are you sure you check oh I did check okay yeah I should have bet clearly should have bet I I don't think that's true I think uh you know I will say against players like Chris Brewer who I know like to check raise I am way less inclined to bets and spots where I don't want to get check raised I don't really want to bet this hand to get check raised right and that may be a bad tendency of mine um or maybe it's maybe it's good I don't know like if you put me in the spot in a super soft tournament where there's only one other good player at the table I'm definitely going to take passive lines I think because I really really want to hang around at the table with all the other bad players sure but maybe that's not a good thought process sure no I mean I don't know man I think against guys like Chris you just have to play like what you think is good yeah like all right fair enough yeah I mean checking here with this hand is totally fine but I think you should be betting at a high frequency it doesn't look totally fine it looks like it's checking like 15 of the time or 10 of the time 15 is a real number though that's true but I to be fair earlier I said I would be fine betting assessment maybe I did just randomly check it maybe I thought he would like his hand who knows yeah for sure if you could look and tell they like their hand with some god-like reading abilities then uh maybe you just check it back yeah yeah absolutely absolutely if you think the track race is coming then don't bat easy game easy game so we get the five diamonds and he goes to ten percent off yeah he does this fancy stuff uh this is this is I'm sure this is some GTO approved strategy and uh he does it yeah a lot of people don't do this though but he does this kind of stuff so this is where the wheels fall off on my strategy because you're never really playing it or you don't play against people who do this all that often correctly right agree and so when he's developing about 10 strategy right let's just think about how we should roughly construct his range he needs to have a little bit of and you talk about some Terror masterclass it needs to have a little tiny percentage of nut hands that can protect the range kind of he's gonna have a the ace high flushes and straight flushes absolutely yeah absolutely I think that makes total sense and a small frequency right yeah and then his whole middling for like the huge portion of his bet 10 range is 10 value hands so what's in value in this scenario I mean it's got to be like bad flushes down to stuff like jacks or maybe nines all right like probably Jacks right yeah a lot of two pair fits into this bet 10 which makes a lot of sense the nine five the nine four there's actually not that many bad flushes in here most most of the weaker flushes probably go into about 25 size because they're worth a little bit more so it's okay so it's even even weaker hands yeah but so it's like a big two-pair portion of this range so I think a lot of people hear you say that okay so say his range is a few nuts mostly two pair and then two Bluffs tiny amount of really really easy to play against because you can just raise them every time well if you raise them every time because he has that portion of nuts he gets developed three betting strategies right and so his range has a lot of two pair but it still has some nuts and that's why it's like protected a little bit and so if you raise him a lot he's just gonna three bet you a lot I don't know if you have to click click click the best small for him yep and then click erase small for us okay now let's see what he's supposed to do no sir you're supposed to be calling with a lot of two pairs and whatnot right yeah about half the time so the question is will your opponent who uses this strategy find the hero calls nose like drag 7 Jack five jack four I'll call right Jack nine all calls some people do some people won't imagine he folds out all of those though as some people will then I think this is like a pretty strong line against some people yeah yeah for sure if they're going to bet 10 correctly and then overfold it's for sure a spot where you should just look to Bluff everything um totally agree with that but some people when you he bets tiny on the river you have us raising the 5x's bet so it's like it's egregiously small this is a real Ray size right yeah and he's still supposed to call it stuff like two pair it's a decent attack at the time yeah for sure I think a lot of people who have studied GTO some but not a lot will bet small on the river here stuff like two pair and then drastically overfold it to a raise yeah I could be wrong yeah no I I think that's like somewhat reasonable the one thing I would be a little bit concerned of is if they think you're going to raise them a lot and they start putting in more nut hands sure like like I think that some people some like so for example in this hand he went well let's let's cover what happened in the river and then I'll say why uh like one note why that might not work at super well sure so he goes to this but you raise about pot he goes to the gym is pot approved by me yeah yeah parts of great spies here for sure I'll even I'll show you I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be going smaller because I know his range we mostly I thought it'd be mostly bad flushes and two pairs and top pairs you want to be you want to be pretty polar yeah you need pretty polar facing it I think um then he jams me and then he jams you and this is where I'm sitting here thinking this guy literally shows me the nuts every single time this really just happened to me early in this tournament again yeah because I mean he definitely has it right he has you know 10 native diamonds and diamonds that's two real combos of just straight flushes yeah and he'd probably played them all somewhat similarly right yep yep I don't care yeah but at the end of the day you're like okay this guy's a good player he's gonna find some gloves I I was sitting here thinking in game is it better to call with a random 10 of diamonds in my hand but I wouldn't raise with a 10 of diamonds in my hand right well you would have traps right so you're Ace eight of diamonds will drop some amount on the turn and so obviously calling with that hand is like your number one Bluff passion well that's the super nuts yeah it's the super nuts yeah yeah say I did decide if I if I had a hand like Ace with a ten of diamonds that I did bet the turn he bets the river for two I guess I probably should raise right yeah yeah let's look at it and then if he jams me that's probably a pretty good call too because once I raise big he's probably not I mean I guess I'll still Jam the ace right yeah that's that is the issue here right it's like and so you're going to find a tiny amount of jams here okay so slow down let's take a look let's discuss over time he bets tiny and now it's on me okay exactly and so here's how your diamonds will play so razor 93 is half pot raise 176 is pot the other sizes all in yep for a gigantic amount by the way or a gigantic amount correct like nine times pot or something yeah yeah I'm probably not ripping it for nine times five not gonna lie so yeah it's only two percent of the time so whatever it looks like yeah so what are we raising go back to all of our hands this is only diamonds I think trying to get off there we go Okay so we are raising with notice like pocket Eights kind of interesting with a diamond it's a small small raise for thin value right that makes some sense if I did have the 10 of diamonds like Ace 10. if you want to hover over that one Ace 10 you see with the 10 of diamonds does raise right so say I did raise here and we get jammed I think that's got to be a call right I don't think so some ace high exactly because I was I wasn't sure in the spot like does the blocker matter more or does the ace matter more you also want to think about his Bluffs right so when you have the Ten of diamonds you're blocking exactly one combo of a straight flush but he also there's only two yeah yeah that's true but what's he gonna have in his hand when he Bluffs yeah I guess I wasn't sure if you would rip it in in the spot with the ace of diamonds no no I mean with the Ten of diamonds right say he has the eight or the Ten of diamonds even though you're blocking the knots you're also blocking his potential Bluffs sure sure and so yeah it's not yeah yeah blocking f is Bluffs too so maybe it doesn't make a difference yeah maybe it's uh it's typically more important to like in this spot it's weird because there's only two values of combo but it's typically more important to block Bluffs or to unblock Bluffs rather go back to his raise all in size please his race his race uh all in look at look at his raising all in range so it does contain asex right yeah yeah so that therefore you'd much rather have the ace and actually this is a cool spot it sometimes happens on four flush boards where wait does see how you have eight six and does he not even have straight flushes here not much where'd they go so he would have played them differently at some point presumably eight six of diamonds plays about 25 size that's where they went so imagine that's 25 now because I want to keep those in keeps 25 we raised to let's say 136 which is probably roughly what I do then he wraps it in and now we need to see a face 10 calls no still okay yeah just just an equity thing I think this is where it gets kind of convoluted where there's a bunch of sizing options because I'm not even sure the opponents use all the sizing options Christopher probably does yeah of course she's super studied but a lot of people in the spot literally have like two best sizes you know yeah for sure it's much more important just on like overall range construction right and so I don't get too caught up in the fact that like he loses eight six when he bets ten because when you raise and he jams he's still jamming with a perfectly balanced strategy and so yeah you don't have to like the blockers May interact and change a little bit but it's still just a very very reasonable strategy that you're going to play against Denver so anyway it's not like the ace of diamonds right all the ace of diamonds always call what about King of Diamonds King of Diamonds is where you stretch your mix okay whatever Asus has to call I can't go around fullness I flashes everyone enjoys a good bluff yeah yeah for sure so what should he be bluffing with in this spot yes this is the interesting point is that he actually went too thin uh or not too thin rather he used he didn't go thin enough and so he put jacket of diamonds uh into about 10 size and it really wants jacket with a diamond with the aided exactly yeah yeah buy that jacket with a diamond into about 10 size and it really should be using like about 25 pot and so this is what concerns me about raising the butt 10 too much is that if people don't go big enough for Value like for the eight of diamonds it's worth 25 pot on the river but if they only go 10 pot on the river all of a sudden they don't need to defend two parity arrays anymore because they just have the eight of diamonds more often right so that's why I get concerned about raising about tens too much because if people put too strong of hands into that middling section of their range for about 10 size all of a sudden they have a really easy time defending against raises okay cool that makes sense yeah yeah for sure I mean there's add more nuts okay or callable hands right yeah exactly exactly so yeah will my opponent actually call my raise with the eight of diamonds some people even fold that they shouldn't but some people do yeah yeah for sure for sure I think it'd be hard for him to fold that uh yeah like a lot of people will a lot of people who like know their first steps of small bets here they'll do it and then they get raised like oh man well you must have the nuts yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure look for those players there's spots like this where you can you can really Crush some players all right next game we gotta go a little bit faster cool cool down with all these GTO hands he wants to yeah sorry perfectly sorry let's let's uh let's do this is the last one and and it will restart so in this hand chipwreck opens you threw at the 98 suited which is great forward call um in this spot I think as you know you're gonna be like really linear you're deep stacked you need to have good playability so you're not going to want to use a hand like uh you know you're not going to want to use ugly blocker looking hands in your strategy like an H50 or like King 5-0 or something crazy like that you just want to have stuff with pretty good playability yeah I mean I look at the chart and I do what the chart says yeah yeah that's right that's always good and reasonable especially against Chadwick right it just wanted to do what the chart says yeah and this is the hand where I was saying that it's pretty sick to develop a lot of raises in position because there we go Ace King seven rainbow you go for a third pop bet which is reasonable he calls but what I think happens in Game a lot is people just bet their pot with their entire range yeah and they're good enough to know what they should be three betting here with and so then I know I'm definitely checking your son but okay go ahead yeah yeah I just think they're 40 checks in general from the population seems really hot it does it does it seems really high people just have to look at like you know Queen nine back doors and just play almost pure track yeah you know Queen a I think people look for the cheap Bluff a lot in the spot yeah I probably do bet a lot of the unpaired hands here too many of them clear yeah yeah I know me too I mean I think it's hard I think the I think I would have checked a lot of asex and King aches a bad ax and King ax yeah and I would have checked a lot of under Pairs and I would probably bet too many garbage hands and it was a nine eight two nine eight apparently checked some yeah 9 8 has some checks uh yeah it's okay to give up a total garbage out of position yeah and actually like I think this is a good point is that you have to you have to differentiate what's total garbage and what makes more sense to bet and then more draws you got a back door draw exactly right garbage that's that's a huge that's a huge difference um because it just allows you to Barrel more turns right because you turn more Equity more often right sure if you went through all these hands the back door draws bet and the Diamonds don't yeah as often yep look at that ten eight nine eight yeah N9 Jack 10 has the does the straight draw with it so it's been at a high frequency yeah yeah gosh asking definitely bet for sure yeah but I think like that's a pretty easy rule of thumb it's like when you have the back door draw that when you don't play a picture like you're going to be a little bit of alternate frequencies but I think that's a totally reasonable way to play the spawn for the best 33 and if you think somebody is betting 33 too often all of a sudden you can develop a lot of raises with like low hands that don't interact at all like a five seven of diamonds so you're essentially saying in this spot that if he thinks we're betting too often look at this chart see the hands that are reasonable raises and raise with them way more exactly yeah so notice though the garbage is Raising all right yeah the guard yeah five five four back doors right yeah I don't think many players find these Bluffs yeah I I totally agree with you but but I think that they're actually really good to use a game yeah I mean people overfold to aggression in general I think a Greek yeah for sure for sure and it's and they see that too much so yeah you have to see betting too much and you have over folded it's like you should be raising a ton in the spine can we putting off left and right next time I go blind yeah welcome well yeah I actually at a spot like this in in the recent okay where I got three bet it was small blind versus hijacked and that 25 pot on um uh king queen six and I had five four back door and I was like well this seems like a reasonable one and I raised and he just tanks forever very clearly just having ace high or something like that and just folds kind of like sweet so yeah these spots come up I think I think it's good to find it's like backdoor type stuff and because I mean even even when he raised like he has to call every King in the deck except for his like worst blocker Kings yeah and queen 10 calls Jack 10 calls yeah nobody calls Jack 10 when they bet the Flop and get Rays out of position yeah yeah it's like good luck right good luck defending the strategy and you know let's take a look at this real quick so they have to call back got shot with back door flush draw right you may be saying why does Queens fold but nine seven calls because nine seven has more outs for sure yeah okay absolutely cool and one one thing that's cool and surprise it's actually kind of a big race size you know 33 to 116. imagine if you just made it 75 yeah they got to call way more exactly they don't look up all the pairs probably like all coming back to our cut shots yeah yeah for sure so if you think somebody's she betting the spot a lot I would look to use a lot of small raises in position and I think small razor position are really sick in general all right well I'm gonna have this on my to-do list good good I can't wait for it to see that in history yeah of course a chidwick cause and then you get the six of diamonds yeah and it goes badouki on the turn and so I think that this is like kind of a cool spot because when it comes to the flush draw let's look at it it becomes pretty easy to find your Bluffs like if it comes with the six of hearts your hearts just get to Barrel at a really high frequency click on clubs here to see what happens to the clubs they're they're not so much and they're gonna withdraw right exactly they're going to Barrel a much lower frequency and this is a common thing where if you turn the back or flush draw you just keep adding because we're also betting with all her good hands right especially out of position right but when it goes for Doogie you have to find it's a little bit trickier to pick your Bluffs right because you don't have any flush drawers there's no lot there's fewer logical ones exactly there's fewer logical ones like take some random stuff and try yeah and now 98 goes pure yeah right whereas on the six of Hearts you differentiate excuse me and you and you Barrel more Hearts when it goes rainbow you have to use 9A it's a pure Barrel in turn because there's less intuitive Bluffs and it's one of your intuitive gloves okay notice that I was betting and eight six is betting I think that was a little bit dicey I don't think I would have bet those I mean this is something I've been trying like really trying to implement is these bottom pair type Bluffs yeah whatever these things are I don't know what these things are but uh GTO doesn't yeah I think that you see it most commonly in position versus big blind spots Ace King X when you turn the two pair they become or when you turn the two pair blocker rather they become extremely good barrels um because when you bet this hundred size he has A6 he has King six he has seven six and so blocking those two pair combos is just huge um and when you turn a six you really don't have that much Showdown value right you only really have shown against exactly Jack 10 Queen 10 Queen Jack yeah not a lot and a little bit of these low Pairs and those hands have loads of equity exactly and they're also going to Bluff you at some frequency right right so you're not going to react they fold like that's fine yeah absolutely and so blocking two pair of combos in this spot is just really great we're gonna have to go back and update the tournament masterclass because uh this is a hard thing to throw in there for sure it's it is tough it happens a lot of attention to that there's a lot of spots well some spots come up like this on the turn especially where you just gotta go for it you gotta try to put in the bluff and it's hard to add that into an implementable strategy because it's not all the time it happens but you're saying it's Ace cyboards King exports um are very very common for it okay one of these fun Corner cases we have to figure out yep yeah we can go through a bunch of Ace King boards and just go through all the spots where we see this two pair blockers Bluff is Ace King and Ace Queen effectively the same boards Ace Queen yeah yes absolutely okay absolutely yeah it's gonna happen a lot and and one thing to keep in mind is it's typically when you have a tighter range if you open the button for example 55 or 55 of hands and then it comes with a six then you don't use two pair blockers because you have 10-5 suited you have so many unpaired 10 highs and Jack highs and stuff like that but when you open an early position for example with like 17 of fans where can you draw your Bluffs from right you don't have as many hands to draw Bluffs from so then your six becomes really good and so in this spot you're playing a tight range situation where you three by the small block so you don't have like you know eight nine off suit to be bluffing off on the turn and have a bunch of combos of it right you have to use logical hands and so when you're having a tighter range now the two pair blocker becomes extremely pertinent and you don't really want to use a hand like Jack nine right this is an air ball right exactly yeah especially at a position you need Equity you need Equity okay cool so you've got the world's happening in this hand I remember what I had okay yeah you barrel for about 60 which is great and the opponent calls and you get not a fun River oh God yeah so this is a tough spot because he's just gonna call me literally every Ace every time right yeah and he's gonna have a lot of Base he doesn't have a lot of King he's gonna have the gut shots I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bet tiny here actually I thought that small would be kind of neat but then he just like randomly hero called me with the camera drag or something yeah I don't think betting tiny makes too much sense for your overall strategy um yeah exactly like if you have pocket aces I guess that that makes some sense in that tiny but let's think about more so what makes a good bluffing candidate on the river I think I actually asked you on the sand afterwards and I was thinking like do I even want to attempt a bluff here yeah that's right so I want to block his calls right I want to block his Auto calls so what are Auto calls I mean an ace but you can't really block an ace right well can you you can watch case Queen Ace track Ace 10. well what's the best suit to not have so you block the most Aces this is where I get a little confused so on the Flop he's gonna have all these Spades clubs and hearts so I guess I want to have diamonds right is that right um so that's typically how it works with backdoor flush draw spots but in this spot you have the Asus page on the board so when you have the eight nine of Spades you don't block any of his suited Aces see what I'm saying when I have nine eight of spades yep I do not block any of us do it okay yeah sure okay because he can have three A's this year part Diamond uh club right so you want to have heart diamond Club in your hand to block the most Aces suited aces in his range so I want to have this hand yes and I don't want to have nine is I don't have any I don't have Spades well I guess so yeah yeah so Spades are bad because of also this seven which is which is like pretty tricky to know in game but I didn't know it in game yeah well it's it's hard right because like when you have the eight of clubs you're also you're blocking a state of clubs you're unblocking his suited King eight right because the King of Clubs on the board and you're blocking his eight seven of Clubs so it's actually really sick to have the a club yeah yeah right I would not have found it and I'm glad see this is stuff Justin does in his spare time he figures out the answer I love this stuff man I love it why does the solver Bluff the 980 club's 100 is the question because that's probably about what's in the incoming let's see and uh there we go right yep so nine out of Spades plays really heavy track because when we J and so nine of clubs Bluffs here the EV of your bluff is worth uh six and the 366. so it is worth essentially nothing right less than two percent of the pot check then um imagine your EV is basically nothing should you just not do it to ensure you stay in the tournament especially if you're down to like half the field or two-thirds of the field even you know it's like there's Merit right you don't have to take your six stop six or six change right into whatever this is I know how much money there's like nothing yeah six and the 366. yeah I can't even count that yeah two percent of two percent of the size of the pot yeah yeah exactly yeah you can you can have it you can have it yeah yeah it's close it's close in these spots now now can you create an overfold where your bluff makes more EV no trademark always calls sure possible he always calls me I show him Bluffs every single time I play with them that's another issue I have is that I've bluffed it off in them like seven times he's just like showed me nuts every time there's there's calls there's a hundred percent Merit in that 100 Merit in that it's not worth that much I think in my mind it's way more important to be thinking about what combos are good um sure that way here's another question for GTO expert why the nine native diamonds um same concept you're blocking Ace nine of diamonds and you're blocking H7 the other question then why not this why not the hearts um the hearts don't match the seven so when you have the heart in your hand you can't have H7 you're not blocking eight seconds gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha yeah okay and then so so here's here's how what I think is important it's like your queen Jack pure give up okay we intend pure give up Jack 10 pure give up and then why are we giving up these in particular and it's gonna be because those are big folding portions of his range so your blocking is auto folds exactly which is a problem exactly so you're blocking is if you have if you have Queen Jack here and you block or you block the king the king queen so you can't have king queen as often therefore we should if you can't have king queen as often though that's good for oh that's bad for us you're right I'm sorry that's bad for us sorry for getting all confused here no no it's this stuff's hard I mean it's I mean if you get turned around it seems like it shouldn't be all that difficult because there's only two ways to go but it's easy no it's hard it's hard man yeah no I I totally agree so but I mean I think in my mind that's what's important it's like you can choose or not to choose to Bluff this in game for a million reasons but if you do bluff this with Queen Jack that's an error right like that that would be an error to Bluff that in um same with like the queen 10 Jack 10. and then if you can think about which dudes matter the most I think that's just going to be beneficial for hundreds of spots sure um and so like matching certain combos is is super nice in a spot like this and that should be pertinent because look at his snap calls right snap calls nine seven of clubs right eight seven of Clubs so you really want to have a nine and eight so yeah like I said you can't really block the ace right so that's so relevant um yeah for sure so is King's actually supposed to fold to the shop yep I I kind of Presumed you to find some calls with some Kings yeah and we see that it's kind of like a similar thing um in terms of the blocker effect where his like King six is a great buff catcher it's because of Blackstone my nuts I mean maybe pocket kings but not that much right you barely have pocket sixes yeah I mean I guess I was thinking I could have seven six but I guess maybe I don't maybe I don't even play a pre-flop no I don't think I gave you something yeah I mean maybe you do a game a little bit yeah um but yeah I mean yeah that could certainly be reasonable in game to choose the six just in case you ever play seven six like that or pocket sixes um but more importantly like the king queen oh but you're not bluffing with a queen in your hands that's actually a little bit interesting oh boy here we go again I thought he would in-game clearly incorrectly that he would call with some Kings which may be like really inclined to not Bluff because I know he has all the a lot of Aces right I know he has yeah I know he has some kings that are gonna call some I thought they're gonna call some so I like it to give up yeah I think it's perfectly perfectly good perfectly good and reasonable hand and he can't stop showing he ends up showing a pure call so that feels really good too right if he shows me like the the dragon or something the Queen Jack that would hurt that's how it goes for me if I check there on the river is he supposed to be bluffing the queen Jack some portion of the time yeah because look find his Bluffs right yeah good luck like he has no Bluffs pretty much so he's gonna Bluff some of those so that's actually why you caused these hands on the turn for the most part it's like like when you Barrel when you bet flop barrel turn calling Jack 10 no back doors like pretty ugly but one of the reasons why it makes the call is that it it becomes a good bluffing candidate on different runouts which gains it more EV than just its raw Equity of like how often am I getting a queen yeah a lot of people ask like companies saying you can't call this hand because you're not getting anywhere near the right pots plus implied odds but you get to Bluff sometimes exactly yeah it's right here you have no Bluffs so if you need some Bluffs for sure yeah exactly imagine you always pulled these hands you literally have an Ace King or seven every single time on the river what are you gonna Bluff with right right it should always Bluff at the seven like that seems crazy some people hear you say that and think oh that's good just have all the nuts no that's bad it's bad to have only the nuts believe it or not yeah yeah sure because that essentially means you're not making money with all of these junky hands because by playing this hand in this way it is making you some money right yeah and yeah money that's good for you for sure all right so that's all the hands we have for now I think we'll be back with some more hands later hope you're enjoying this series if you do let us know good luck in your games have fun GTO is hard but um we're gonna do our best and continue improving together thank you very much Justin thanks coach thank you talk to you soon", metadata={'source': '6ny5vmZiWbM', 'title': 'How To Play PERFECT Poker [US Poker

[Document(page_content="hello everyone Lexi Gavin Mather here and I've decided to do a course that is kicking it way back to the basics this is a great course for people that are very new to Poker maybe you just signed up for the course or you know maybe you haven't you know you've been playing for a while but really haven't put too much study into your game um this is also good for people that you know are a little bit more experienced in poker it's never a bad thing to revisit some of the most basic concepts because you're learning and studying so much that it could be you know it could be easy to forget some of the more you know basic fundamentals so um I decided to create a very basic course and it's gonna be kind of a road map for you to you know help you navigate um you know how your your study plan and you know kind of where to start on your poker Journey all right let's get into it how do we even know where to begin there's like I said there's so many Concepts in poker there's so many different strategies and different topics and it's really hard to know where to begin and like what the first thing you should start with should be so I think that the very first thing that you need to really familiarize yourself is learn your race first in ranges these are your GTO RFI charts for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about let me go ahead and pull some into the screen here this is an example of a raised first in range so obviously actually first the very first thing you should probably know is you know learn the positions at the table but once you have that down pat um these are your RFI charts so this is the under the gun range meaning this these are the hands that you should be raising when you are first to act pre-flop as you can see we are pretty tight here opening most of our you know our strongest hands um some you know ace5 suited is four suited for balance type things but basically this just tells you which hands you should be raising which hands you should be folding um let's go down to the button just so that I can show you kind of the biggest contrast here um so the button we're opening 56 percent of hands and you can see that it is just a ton more hands we get to open um on the button and you're always going to make you know opponent adjustments if you have tighter players in the blinds then you can open up a wider range or if you have more aggressive players still have to act then you should probably be playing a little bit tighter so these are your RFI charts this is like the Holy Grail of Poker this is what you need to start with you if you have mistakes in your pre-flop game then you're just setting yourself up for you know difficulties and mistakes post flops so make sure you have a fundamentally sound pre-flop game and study and memory our eyes these RFI charts a lot of people have trouble kind of memorizing your RFI charts and you know I think a good way to do it is to make flash cards I think flash cards can be really helpful and also don't worry about memorizing these to like an exact T right like you should just kind of have an idea like on the button you're opening all of your off suit Ace Combos and all your pseudo days Combos and and for three suited and up and five three suited it up you know things like that if you start with the bottom and then just kind of work your way up like it's easier to kind of remember uh okay the next thing you should do is familiarize yourself with hand equities by using Equity calculators I like Ecolab poker crunchers great let me go ahead and show you what I mean by that all right so basically uh this is an equity calculator it basically tells you what percent chance your hand has of winning against other hands and versus other hand ranges so let's uh let me show you what I mean here so here we have the positions on the left side let's say we are on the button so The Bu here we're going to click our card selection and let's say we have 10 nine of Hearts okay so we enter 10 nine of hearts and the small blind shoves all in for 15 big blinds let's just say so what we do to figure out our hands Equity versus the range that our opponent could be shoving meaning like the the number of hands that they could be shoving uh what you do is you go to this little like card fanned out icon here and you click that and then you plug in all of the hands that you think your opponent from the small blind is shoving when you open let's just say you Min raise the button and they have 15 big blinds so you can just like play around with this just try to think what hands that they would be shoving with uh I think it's going to be like a lot of these Broadway Type hands hands with good removal to some of your snap cards removal meaning like when you hold uh an ace then it's less likely your opponent has you know some ACE combos things like that um so I think they're going to be shoving pretty much any pair in these positions um you know maybe a range like this so then what we do once we've plugged in all of the hands that we think that they're shoving with um I think that they're actually going to have some like balance here with the low-sitted Aces and things like that um then we hit apply and then evaluate and then this tells you whether you can make a profitable call based on the range of hands that the that your opponent is shoving so you can see that 10 nine of Hearts has 38 Equity over the 62 Equity that the small blind range consists of so then you know that you ha you know that you should probably be folding this spot um I probably could have started you guys off with a more basic way to play around with this so if that was a little too complicated um what you can also do is just start by playing with hands versus other hands not necessarily hand ranges so say you are in the cut off and you have is King hit Ace King and then your opponent has pocket tens you enter that and then you hit evaluate and then you can see that it's we call this a coin flip this is like roughly a 50 50 shot um so you can just kind of play around with that and see how your hand matches up to other hands and this is just a good way for you to understand you know kind of the value of hands and and you know when you should be making profitable calls and Folds okay now let's talk about the you know topic that is so so important but people just don't want to spend too much time studying and learning uh and that's bankroll management it's so important so bankroll management is basically just making sure you don't go broke and as a you know I mean it's obviously more than that but as a poker player a lot of poker players you know play Above their bankrolls and they will you know bust their roles and then they'll you know not have any any money to play with so there's a you know there's formulas that you can make sure that you are you know not letting this happening uh so proper bankroll management is crucial to your success as a poker player it's very true the general rule and this is not a set in stone rule but you should have at least 30 buy-ins of any stake that you play so if your average by if your average steak is one two and your average buy-in is a hundred big blinds so that would be 200 and just you know for the cash game players out there please please please always make sure that you're playing with at least 100 big blinds um when you sit down because the more chips you have the more playability you have and the less chips you have if you have under 100 big blinds then your session is going to be higher variants meaning it's going to be more of a Gamble and you're not gonna you know you kind of have to rely a little bit more on luck whereas if you have a lot of chips and you have a lot more playability so I recommend always sitting with at least 100 big blinds so in this situation if you're playing one two then your your average buying would be 200 right so if you need to you know in order to proper bankroll practice proper bankroll management if you need to have 30 buy-ins of the stake that you're playing then 30 times 200 is six thousand dollars so I recommend having at least 6 in your bankroll um to start now if you know if it's not like too big of a stake like one two you could get away with less um you know having like 20 big blinds but the higher the stakes I recommend just having a bigger bankroll because higher Stakes tend to be like more aggressive and tougher so you want to have you know more okay and you want to treat your money as an investment so understand that when you're sitting at the table you're you're investing in yourself you're investing in your opportunity and I think that it's really important to you know not think of them as chips it's really easy to just kind of lose a sense of a dollar and you know poker chips are just so easy to you know just like I said lose track of what a dollar is but those chips are real money values so the you're sitting down with a bunch of chips these are an investment into yourself and you need to take it seriously um I also think you should be investing yourself in other ways like buying poker coaching courses and classes and private coaching um hiring a private coach is a great idea the more money you spend on yourself learning the you know obviously the better you're gonna do with the tables and you'll have a higher Roi or return on investment when you do invest in yourself and then you always want to separate poker money from Life money so I always suggest having two different bank accounts one for your life expense expenses and then one for your poker bankroll the reason for this is because it's it could be really um taxing on you to have all of your money mixed and it could it could affect your emotions if you find that you're gambling with your rent money or you know if you have a bad session and you see that you know if if you're not separating the two then you're just gonna have a hard time compartmentalizing and poker you know no matter how you slice it you are going to lose sometimes so you need to make sure that you separate your two bank accounts and you know try not to attach any emotion to your poker bankroll bank account because it's gonna fluctuate but when you see your rent money fluctuating then that could be really stressful and then that'll force you to make bad plays on the table I actually recommend having a set aside life expenses for at least one year before you decide to go pro if that's something you're considering um make sure you have enough money to set yourself up for a year that you can you know it's kind of financially support the downswings okay so now let's talk about shot taking and what I mean by shot taking is you know say you've been playing one two for a while and you've been consistently winning I think it's okay even if you're not quite bankrolled for it but you can take a shot at a higher stake as long as you're doing it responsibly so first and most important I think confidence is so important you have to be confident in your game and you can't jump up to a stake that makes you nervous I remember the first time I ever took a shot at 5 10 I was like regularly grinding two five and it was going really great and I was winning consistently over time um but I remember that the players at the 510 game were like really really good this is way back in the day like 15 years ago and I remember just feeling inadequate in a way I like the 5 10 players kind of felt like the cool kids and I wasn't quite sure I was ready to fit into that yet so I uh jammed up to the 510 level I played for like an hour and then I lost all my chips um so if you're not confident it's gonna show in your game and don't try not to take a shot at a higher stake if you don't feel like you're ready um so you can take a five buy and shot when you've built up your confidence and your bankroll a bit it's good to get some experience at the higher level if you lose then just move back down uh it shouldn't take you long before you can take another shot and there is no rush to do so until you feel absolutely ready it could be like really hard and ego I think I always say ego is the silent killer of poker players ego could destroy your poker game if you if you move up in Stakes or if you're just like regularly playing you know like two five and you're going on a downswing and your bankroll is suffering then you have to have the discipline to move down in stakes and that could be really really hard for someone to do especially if you're a regular at a casino and they see you playing in you know the 2-5 game and then you feel like you're almost embarrassed to have to move down in Stakes well you shouldn't because it happens to everybody and you know having that discipline to move down in Stakes is really gonna you know separate you from you know the the ego players you know to the to the players that are just playing you know more responsibly and I I'm telling you over the long term like you will you will be rewarded for that and then if you're a tournament player I always say with tournaments stick to try to stick to an average buy-in strategy and then make adjustments based on how soft you expect the field to be so for instance say you're properly bankrolled for 400 tournaments and those have been going really well and that's kind of your average buy-in like it's okay to take a shot you know at a higher higher tournament or you know it's okay obviously to drop down but if you you can take more shots if you expect the field to be softer in higher buy-in so for instance if there's like a 1K that's running with um two million dollar guarantee or something absurd like that and they're running a lot of satellites for it so you know that there's going to be a lot of recreational players in it then you can you know you can take a shot at that higher buy and if you expect the field to be softer because when you have an edge in the field that's you know that's really going to help you you you know cash more and and hopefully maybe win the tournament and a couple more things to note if things are going well it might be tempting to take a shot in a bigger game try to resist that Temptation if your bankroll strategy doesn't allow for it playing at a high level without the funds to back you up is a recipe for disaster and you should never play with scared money it's very easy to naturally address your strategy when you see your monthly money dwindling down um you know move move up in Stakes when you hit a rough patch or I'm sorry move down in Stakes when you hit a rough patch just try to be honest with yourself it's very easy to lie to yourself in poker so you know make sure that you're always being straight up and honest with yourself poker is a marathon not a Sprint this is so so true poker is all about getting to the long term as fast as you can and it's really hard to do that I'll explain what I mean in a second it's really hard to do that playing one table so there's variance in poker meaning you are going to you know get it in good and lose for hundreds of hands it's just like how poker works so what I mean by get to the long term as fast as you can when you're playing in a casino you're sitting at a table you're playing one hand right you're or I'm sorry you're seeing you're playing one table so you're seeing you know maybe 30 hands an hour but when you're playing online you can you have the luxury to play multiple tables so what I used to do is I used to play 24 to 30 tables online at a time and I so I was seeing thousands of hands an hour so I was able to get to the long term faster because I was putting in so much volume the more hands and the more volume you play the more variance balances out so you'll you'll get to equilibrium faster if you play more tables now I'm not suggesting you should go and play and fire up 30 tables at a time that's definitely not something I would suggest especially if you're new to poker but um you know try if you have access to playing online try throwing in two tables and then when you feel more confident and you feel like you have that under control then add in a third table and then a fourth table and see if you can really make sure that you're focusing on every table and every decision and if it gets too much then I would say just you know cut and cut down a table um but the more hands you play the more volume you play the more variance kind of measures out now I'm not saying you can't win in LA in live poker that's not at all what I'm saying the games generally are softer in live poker um you know just try to play a fundamentally sound game in your you know a state that you're comfortable with and you're gonna Crush as long as you study studying is very important okay so now that we've talked about kind of the you know fundamental stuff where to begin the mindset type stuff let's talk about pre-flop bed sizing because there are bed sizing formulas that you have to make sure you're sticking to um otherwise you are just not gonna you're just playing improperly so your your bed sizing is gonna Depend and change based on your stack depth so when you're under 20 big blinds effective or 20 big lines and under you can Min raise meaning you can double the size of the big blind and you can open shove less so if you have like 15 big blinds uh you can still Min raise fold off that stock size but you can um also have like an open shoving strategy meaning you can just go all in pre-flop when you're under 20 bit blinds uh 21 to 49 big lines effective I would say 2.25 X the big blind it really kind of depends on whether you're playing a tournament or a cash game um tournaments I tend to choose smaller pre-flop bed sizing because tournaments are all about stack preservation and every chip that you do invest in the pot um is you know every chip is so valuable whereas in a cash game you have the luxury to reload um and like I said earlier I'm never playing in a cash game when I'm under 100 big blinds this is more like the effective stack meaning the smallest stack and play so when you're 21 to 49 big blinds effective you should 2.25 X the big blind when you're 50 to 100 big blinds you can 2.5 x you can even 3x this these sizings are not set in stone this is just kind of a general idea 100 big blinds uh effective you can 3x the big blind uh 200 big blinds and in cash games 4X you can even 5x the big blind the idea and I think you're getting it is the deeper you are the more the bigger your pre-flop bed sizes should be and then if there's limpers so when somebody just calls the size of the big blind you want to add one big blind for every limper and then one big blind if you're out of position like playing from the blinds or something so for instance if uh you if the blinds are one dollar two dollar and somebody limps in for two dollars and you're on the button and you want to raise then I would go three times the two which is six dollars right three times the the big blind plus an additional big blind for that limper so three times two is six plus that two dollars for that limper is eight so I would raise to eight dollars if I was in the small blind and I wanted to raise in that same situation I would raise to ten dollars because I always add one extra big blind for being out of position so now let's talk about three betting and we're gonna get more into three betting later in this presentation but three betting is basically a re-raise so when you want to re-raise somebody so say somebody opens to you know six dollars and you want to re-raise that person uh you would go 18 so three bet sizing uh you multiply on the opening race size and you add one times the BET one bet for every caller so let's say you're 100 big blinds effective at 100 200 there's a raise to 600 and a call your three bet or your rewrite re-race size would be uh three three x to 18 so 1800 plus that 600 for that uh other caller so it would be 2400 total right so three times the 18 plus 600 for the flatter so that's 2400 you would raise two I know this again I know is super basic but it's really important that you guys stick to these sizing formulas because you never want to give your opponents too good of a price to call and I see this so much with my new students or recreational players they're just choosing race sizes uh and three bed sizes pre-flop where you're just giving your opponents an auto call and you never want to do that right like the the more players in the hand the less your the lower your hands Equity becomes and the less likely it is you're gonna win that pot right it's just a fact like even pocket aces hand you know that your hand with pocket aces that your Equity goes down significantly if there's five players in the pot and you need to make sure that you're choosing proper three bed sizes to to really squeeze them out of the pot um you know you always want to try to isolate to a heads up pod or a three-way pot so your chances of winning post flop are greater right if you're up against five or six ranges pre-flop like chances are you're you're not gonna take down the pot all right learn how to count outs and Equity this is actually this sounds intimidating but it's so not so there's the rule of four and two so when you're first of all Equity is just like the percent chance that your hand has of winning so like when we were just doing the equity calculators before um pocket tends to Ace King is roughly 50 50. it's like 52 48 some you know something along those lines so um that's your Equity so pocketense has roughly 52 Equity to win the ham so what you do on the Flop so say you have a hand and you're on the Flop you're gonna count the number of outs and multiply that by four so the number of outs that you need to complete your draw and you multiply that by four and that's how much Equity you have to complete your draw so what I mean by that let's let's look at an example or let me tell you an example so say you have a flush draw right say you have two Spades and there's two spades on the Flop and you want to know the percent chance that your hand has of winning right so what you do is you count how many outs you need right how many outs you have so you have two Spades in your hand there's two spades on the board there's 13 cards of every suit so you have nine Spades to come that will complete your flush draw right that will give you the flush so all you do is you take those nine outs and you multiply that by four and that gives you 36 percent equity so you have a 36 percent chance of completing your flush on the flop when you're on the turn so say you counted your outs and your equity and you missed the the turn you did not complete the flush by the turn and now you're on the turn so all you do is you just because instead of two cards to come there's only one card to come so instead of multiplying you're out by not by four you multiply your outs by two so you still have nine Spades in the deck that could come but you only have one card to come so nine times two is eighteen you have an eighteen percent chance of hitting your flush by the river so you have 18 equity all right so when you have a straight draw let's let's look at a straight draw so with a straight draw say you have five six on the on the seven eight Deuce flop right so you have eight outs right you have four uh fours and you have four nines right you have five six you can make a straight if the four comes or you can make a straight if the nine comes right five six the board is seven eight nines or fours will give you a straight so that's eight outs so on the Flop you have eight times four is thirty two percent equity on the turn eight times two is sixteen percent equity if you missed you're straight on the turn all right so I hope you guys understand that okay next we're gonna talk about position um you know we talked earlier with the race first in ranges uh understanding you know what hands you should be opening you're always going to be tighter in early position and wider in later position um when you're in early position you're out of position on everybody so you have a positional disadvantage anyone that acts after you has more information on you so therefore you're at a disadvantage post swap so the idea is you want to try to play as much in position and as little out of position as you can so that's why we stay super tight in early position and we widen up quite a bit as we get closer to the button and the button we we can play the most hands because on the button we are guaranteed to be in position on everybody at the table post spot so therefore we can play a wider range of hands and because we have more information on everybody else um position you know it's it becomes more important as Stacks become deeper so when you're short stacked in early position um you don't have as many options you have to play you know more of a if you're like 10 big lines or 15 big blinds you're gonna play more of a shove or fold type of strategy um so it doesn't when you're when you're deeper you're gonna it it's just more important to play a more like a more like pot controlled type of strategy when you're super super deep so what I mean is like say you're 200 big blinds deep and you flop a draw um you don't necessarily say you flop like a flush draw with nine eight of hearts or something and there's two hearts on the board you don't necessarily want to play a 400 big blind pot with you know with a nine High flush draw so you're going to be doing a little bit more like Puck controlling when the stacks are deeper and you want to play tighter in early position because you don't want to like have to play Big pots in out of position post-flop so try to but on the other hand when you are deeper like you can play a wider range of hands you just have to you know proceed with more caution post flop I guess that's what I'm saying um and as you get closer to the button obviously with the short stack you can shove wider than if you were in early position so just always try to make those positional adjustments based on your stack size and always be aware of ranges so what I mean by range you know we talked about it earlier is understanding what you know what the range of cards your opponent can have based on the position and the stack size and you know a few other factors so for example say you're you know you open in under the gun position say you have pocket aces and you raise it up and it folds around to the big blind and the big blind calls and the Flop is 987 with you know two hearts and you have eight of spades Ace of Spades eight of Clubs you have to be aware that that is a really good board for the big blinds range because the big blind is going to have more two pairs than you on that board because they're flatting with you know hands like nine seven suited nine eight suited eight seven suited things like that and the big blind can always have more flush draws than you because you they are you know they already have a big blind invested so they are getting a better price to call um so they're going to be flatting wider with you know suited hands that we wouldn't be opening in early positions so they're going to be calling with hands like King three of Spades where we're never gonna be you know opening that in an early position so uh they can always have more flush draws than you um so always be aware of ranges and yeah let's now move on to pot odds It's always important to understand pot odds and you know you don't have to be a math wizard in poker poker math is pretty easy but you definitely have to have a general idea of you know pot odds inequities and stuff like that so pot odds are considered the price in poker it's the ratio between the size of the pot and the size of the bet so let's look at an example so again pod odds equals the size of the pot to the size of the BET say the pot size is a hundred dollars and the BET size is fifty dollars so now the total pot size is a hundred and fifty dollars so you ha are getting a hundred and fifty dollars to uh you can you're getting 150 to 50 uh so you're getting three to one because what you do is you divide both sides by 50. so you are getting three to one pot odds so you're risking fifty dollars to win two hundred dollars because you always have to consider the you know if you invest fifty dollars that money is now into the pot so you're risking fifty dollars to win two hundred dollars so you're getting three to one odds whisking 50 to win 200. this is something that's super important to memorize this is going to tell you what percent equity your hand needs uh to make a profitable call based on the Pod odds so when you're getting four to one odds you need 20 Equity so if you have a flush draw you know on the on the Flop then you know that you have 36 Equity so if you're getting four to one odds you know that you can make a profitable call because your hand only requires 20 Equity if you're on the turn and you have the flush draw then you know that your hand has roughly 18 Equity because it's so close I would more than likely not fold my hand when I'm getting four to one odds um so just try to memorize this because this is really helpful and it's an easy way to kind of memorize like you know when you're getting what hand what percent equity your hand needs uh based on the Pod odds all right so Hand class so what your hand classes your whenever you have a hand and you're dealt a flop I always want you to break your hands up into four different classes this is a very very basic strategy and as you get more advanced you're obviously going to be making adjustments to this but this is kind of how I want you to think of um your hands in terms of classes so your class A are your value hands these are all of your top pair top kickers your two pairs sets straights flushes full houses right all of the hands that you want to bet for value your class B are your draws so these can be any kind of draws your flesh draws straight draws back door flesh draws gut shots things like that your class C are your medium strength hands these can be anything from middle and bottom pairs Sometimes some goodies highs and then your class D are your garbage hands these are hands that completely miss this would be like ace four of hearts on a 987 all Spades type of board so then what we want to do is we want to group our class A and our class B hands together and for the most part we're going to be continuation betting these so for those of you who don't know continuation betting is when you were the pre-flop aggressor you were the last person to make the aggressive action pre-flop and continuation betting would just be to continue betting on the Flop so what you're gonna do you're gonna group your at your class A and your class B so your value hands and your draws and you're going to be betting those and then you're going to group your class C and your class D hands so your middling hands and your garbage hands and for the most part we're going to be checking those the reason we do this is to remain balanced we don't always want to just bet every time we have a pair so we don't want to just bet when we have you know a Class A and A Class C hand and then check when we have like a Class B in a Class D right we always want to just try to be balanced so that we have you know we can keep our opponents on their toes and they never really know what we're up to so now that we know when you know what hands we should be see betting and what hands we should be checking for the most part the seabed size and frequency so the bed sizing that we choose and how often we choose to do it varies based on the board texture so we're going to see that more on dry boards and choose a small sizing and then we're going to see bet Less on wet textures and choose a larger sizing so just for those of you who don't know a dry board is a board that is not connected there's not really any draws so an example of a dry board would be like King seven two rainbow and a wet board has a lot of draws and a lot of connectivity so that would be like a jack 10 9 with a flush draw type of board that would be a wet wet board um bed sizing is a function of frequency the more often we do something the the more often we do something the smaller we should go and the less often we should do we do something the bigger we should go so because we don't you know we bet small boards at a higher frequency we're going to choose a smaller sizing and because we bet less often on wet boards we're going to choose a bigger sizing I hope you guys enjoyed this course if you liked it you know go ahead and give me a follow on YouTube Instagram Tick Tock Twitter all that I'm Lexi gavinpoker um I love to

[Document(page_content="okay so are these lower Stakes I go for a 2.5 instead of a 3X uh I think I want to put pop control as much as I can while I'm getting reason people yeah so I just want to like put control as much as I can and keep pots as small as possible because I think we're going to get the biggest Edge by making hands and getting the chips in um I still want to be aggressive because I want to get the overfolds pre-flop uh it turns out that obviously frenzy Fred here ends up being a rig and I don't think I would get over Paul's pre-flop from from frenzy fed but regardless he was unknown at this time and so I still think having an aggressive uh especially with like the GTO aggressive hands stuff like King seven Queen Seven like all the big connect disconnecting High cars they just do better because we're blocking their calling range with King X and stuff like that so do you have some more Falls naturally so I still use those hands as my aggressive hands and they're more like hands that make straights and flushes I don't mind limping them because they just can make a lot of equity and we can go post flop and make good heads so for example like Queen 10 suited here probably limp and king queen sewage is just such a high EV hand that we want to put money in the pot and keep and see bit small as as per GTO any on a paper board not going to want to go any bigger than this we've got the range advantage um we don't block any black doors so us here in this queen is just a massive it's a massive part for our range the the only thing is he's not got many folds here on the turn and I don't want to bloat the pot too big in case we are against the nine because I'd end up here recalling too much on Rivers given that given that um that we don't block any of his back door drawers and stuff like that so if I was to bet here and he called and then the river came a brick and I decided to check cool out I think the pot would just be too big and we get a bit of it's like I guess we let the pot get too big that way it was this we allow some of his back door Equity hands to bet and some of his floats just a bit uh he he ended up having Queen 10 of Spades which is fine on the call but I I would try to have a heart in my hand or at least one diamond and maybe two hearts just I think it's okay though because Queen height is strong enough I think all of all the Broadways are going to be fine for him it's cool um I don't think he'd read a problem no mistake there um foreign but just still want to take a note that he's going to be not missing floats right that's that that's um and also that he blocked back the turn and this was a big note here because he blocked by the turn in order to check back the river and that's the note I end up taking here is it's so he can get the free check on the river so here with um top and bottom is going to always be a bet for us we don't block the main check back it's going to be jackets so we're not blocking that and his Heracles are going to be like Ace Jack and sometimes Queen Jack because it blocks are straight and doesn't block some of my Bluffs there might be some low diamonds or whatever so we still want to go all in because his ja is clear of course aren't interfered and he's still going to go with like Ace Jack type hands so he's definitely want to just be going all in here even though the straight complete and a lot of our Bluffs get there I'm still gonna have some Bluffs and it's going to be a good father and he doesn't end up having a nice Jack I don't actually remember in Revenue check because all this is going on I didn't actually see what handy had so it's good to see that yeah the bluff catches you'd expect them to have uh King five here I I told you if going all in I don't know him I think going or Lynn's pretty good but then I thought maybe a 2X pot he's gonna be really ballsy to go all in over top of it and he might treat it the same as an all-in uh and sometimes just fold some chops he doesn't fold a chop but we also get to see that he raised Jack Fireball suit on the bottom and so it's noteworthy I don't know if I do take a note on it but at least we get to see that what kind of range he is playing and definitely should be taken in here again a bit disorientated because trying to get tables get rid of tables um but definitely want to be taking those kind of notes because now we can Free Bet Jam a lot pre-flop against his opened uh and and yeah just like even like this is as wide as like Ace Ace X off suit like if it's on if someone shows me Jack five off in their opening range I would jam like ace2 or suit I would just jam it proof I'd play like someone that's playing heads up so here is another very interesting spot here so here we wouldn't want to go anything shy of getting all the chips here when he checks to turn um so yeah we set up we set up an SP of one so always thinking about spr um because when someone sees the river two two to one uh that they're getting on the river they're gonna just talk themselves into calling especially when like all the hearts don't fill in and especially like a great card like this comes and he's never going to fold a seven so there's no reason to ever not put order chips in and I expect people to be calling with some 3x here as well just because when when like these Hearts just don't come in uh people get sticky so yeah don't want to go for anything less than all of it King High we've got enough Showdown no need to take it into a bluff here and always trying to see what people are doing and so as you see he doesn't doesn't Bluff too free two is a lot more easy for us to make comments on so yeah and open it is this um so I didn't see that I didn't say bet into two of them uh flatting range and small blind it can be so wide but also can be super narrow uh when I don't know I just tried to get to Showdown soon as possible try to see a showdown uh just put control all the way obviously when we've got a gut shot in the pair on the term we're great um going for the double check here more for deception against a great player that would check raise me a lot when I don't have much six seven in my range a good player will definitely try to exploit that with uh quite a few blocks and possibly turns some of his pairs into Bluff and R9 being the best hand a lot of time but I think we're going to get put in a lot of awkward situations uh am I willing to get in on the turn with 9 10 no I'm not so I think pot controlling is nice maybe going with like some ones that don't interfere with some of his Bluffs because I think the 10's going to interfere with something there's Bluffs there if we had like an ace 10 I think trying to set up Stacks there like I did with the eights is better uh with the queen 10 here we want to build a pot we want to build a pop but we also don't wanna we don't want to take away from the fact that we're going to be limp stabbing just one BB a lot to exploit him so I tried to keep it small just to keep that Dynamic around just limp saving uh the 1bb and here's close but again I don't know if he's a recreational or not but I just want to get as much value as possible with with her Queen here and uh yeah don't expect them to really ever have me beat so uh and I don't think he's going to call too big given the run out um so far nothing too interesting it's just kind of standard stuff but they don't it does get quite interesting this Ace King is super close to if I want to see a bit of a check um the reason I don't mind it as a c bit is while our hands as good as it's pretty much going to be like I mean we can turn to make it we could we could we might be like getting pushed off our hand but we also have the best hand a lot and we have a decent hand to like two streets if it doesn't come get eight nine or ten on the tone or a diamond and so I would like kind of if you just called I probably actually use this combos with Bluff the Ace King I know how that kind of sounds crazy but I'm just not blocking any of the things that you would love but we would fold and I think when I check back I'm just going to lose pretty much a high frequency especially now that we're recognizing this by guys a reg he's been in our games in the 50s pretty much everyone uh it's 100 up here so for that reason I decided to take Ace King as a bluff as against a recreational I would just check back because I don't expect them to to take the term Probe on that board as much as a reg would because I think it's a great exp board to just to fire away on and I want to be quite protected when I check back against a reg on that board and so Ace King kind of goes into my sum Equity hand also blocking some of his like hero cooling hands like even like his King second pair and stuff like that or Ace Ace bottom pair those are going to be is like hero cooling hands and I'd block those so if it just cause to flop and it does come some absolute rubbish two free off suit Spade or something then Ace King can be a great candidate virtual Barrel 19 sewage gonna raise if he was to jam get a cool even if he's a recreational don't know anything about him I'm still not I'm not gonna fold such a high agree hand um even if it's there might I don't I'm not one to make like big exploits like a 910 suit there to me would be a big exploit if I was to raise fold it and if I was to ever think about folding it I'll just limp fold it if that was the case if I wanted to make that exploit against someone but I want to still play because I think the hand just does best uh when we're that shallow October blades if we're a bit deeper just limp cool ISO and then fold the jams here is this is the first interesting Sport and now free flop here if this was a reg I would be folding here uh you might be thinking that's crazy five eight suited but he's reasonable for 11 big blinds this guy's got 8.5 big blinds so like effectively he's kind of playing like a 10 people in range and this is already marginal but as a recreational I think they're just gonna like because he should be an open gym in like Ace X all acex he should be open German like Queen Jack and this range should be super polarized actually super strong because the worst hands he's going to be raising if it was a rig it's gonna be something like King King eight King Nine offsuit so they're the kind of Bluffs and I just don't think that's the case I think a recreational especially in 100 game is just going to be like raising some hands that he should be going all in with and if he was to put it in pre-flop uh ranges against someone that's like raising like their ranges that are going all in with the handset they should go all in like Ace five eight six A7 offsuit Etc and even the suited ones uh if we was to put those in the range then we could even call as wide as like Queen two off suit even some like Jack five offsuits and stuff like that if if we think their range is that wide at this spr but because it's so polar um these hands actually end up becoming very very close to a full so against a break who would be jamming his A6 and probably over jamming in his Min Rays is super strong then we won't realize our equity and having suited and connecting hands isn't even like like I would never fold uh six eight suited because we make more straight draws with it but five eight suit I would have been it then we get a flop that doesn't really hit his range that much uh given that I expected in a recreational to be too wide and potentially like if I was to bet he might just Jam you in a hand like uh something stronger A6 maybe king queen or like at least not gonna fold um so I decide to go for an a bit of an unorthodox uh donk I don't go for the bigger size I decided to go a bit smaller just to really induce him um yeah he goes all in he ends up having Ace fire but this kind of like proves my point that pre-flop like we want to be calling here and then um if it was like a reg that wouldn't have that wide of a range you would want to be folding uh we get to make back the EV straight away so that's pretty nice okay so here with King Nine uh we've got a strong hand we're in position we don't want to let our opponent just think he can get away with limping and we've got a good hand that blocks some of his limp jams like Ace King obviously being one of the main ones um so and even some of his limp calls 910 suited Queen nine off suit their hands like that were blocking those hands so we're just going to win the pot a lot there and yeah I think just taken anytime we can win win a pot and build a pot that we have a very strong hand with and King nine is a strong hand once someone's limped he's close um we could we can do Eva in hindsight I think checking uh is good um but again he is a recreational and yeah just building building a pot it gets recreational never going to be a bad thing with the high top end of our range especially now when we turn pretty much nuts of it in the street um uh we bet Harper now obviously not folding he he does have a straight that's fine coolest happen but I think I think uh check-inflop is fine also um yeah something definitely like Queen six I would start and then Queen Seven is just like right there on the edge so now we've got Linda puppy who is a good wreck I haven't noted everyone yet because again this computer is quite new and haven't noted everyone who they are yet but I have got notes on him so I've obviously played in on this computer but Linda puppy is going to be one of the better eggs so we get two two hundred dollar games I don't know who European is I've never played him before I'd assumed he's a reg given that he was on two tables so I kind of count these as red games again with the King seven is close uh I actually check it back majority of the time but at the beginning of games I like to establish a aggressive against limps one because I don't expect people to limp Jam as much at the beginning uh with the like speculative hands I will expect them to kind of feel you out a bit at the beginning of the game and here with the King seven I think it does hit his limp cool range a lot he's still got like Jack nine in his range he's got some Queen tendons range and it's not a bad there's not that many like two super scare cards for us given that we've got top pair not going to have A6 too much and yeah obviously worst card being like a Jack or an ace so an ace being the worst card sorry and a nine then when you check to turn now we want to kind of get as much chips as we can in we do expect them to have some Parish straight drawers here uh don't expect him to don't expect him to like just Jam them expect them to call them Tech Nine is interesting um so when we bet flop obviously we do interfere with some of its drop calls with the Knight of diamonds um so does waiting towards heaven some high diamond Queen of Diamonds I've came together with Jacob diamonds King of Diamonds uh and then we size up turn don't expect them to fold those diamonds uh do expect them to fold so like definitely 2X and some 6X with a diamond wooden uh okay so over here with the eight nine we've limped and bet yeah so we limped in and sized up the Flop that we turned our got shot straight and then so I think just going half pot our opponent's got more of this in his range he's going to have more two pair combos in his range he's going to have like the the three four which we just don't have in our range he's going to have somebody he's definitely going to have eight nine in his range but we have 89 obviously but we as our general range is going to be played he's going to have the seven five he's going to have the six five six seven and uh he's gonna have even some King seven so um yeah I think this is a mistake here over here I I ran it in in the silver often we can actually look at that quickly in a second we can run it we can look at a second um I end up calling because I don't block the higher Diamond I think there's a good run out for him to Bluff especially when I check and so if he's got like a queen of diamonds jacket diamonds I do expect him to take his breath he had obviously very good combo to play the way he did because he had the six of diamonds so it kind of like it shows like that he's a good player and the way he played it and win the six mini six pairs I go for a check given that I feel I feel that six is a big part of his range but having said that I think we should just still bit half pot because we can induce more Bluffs when we bit half pot something like something like uh seven eight or or five eight type hands would probably Bluff over over a bit but they'll just check back so I think I think a bit of a mistake I just thought the six was such a big part of his range that I mean we're getting that anyway but I would hate for him just to cool like my half pot but I think even against half bought it's gonna Gem and I think this probably would be a candidate that he would Bluff with if we had bet half pot so I think we we definitely missed one though uh here great combo for checking back and great combo for hero calling on numerous runouts obviously this is a uh this is not a size I'd expect them to be bluffing so many bets that size I do expect him to have some Showdown expect some 9x this is a very bad card for his range um so I decided to go polar um just because I think like he's just going to fold everything anyway I could do it there is an argument for making making a block bet or something like that but I don't like to block bit in position too much especially when it's a break I want to like really just go polar in this kind of situation to really kind of make them really question their range if they've got some Queen X or if they've got like a two pair type type combo um then just force them to call um I think that if I was to block bet here and stuff like that in the long run I wouldn't make as much um I've ran it in my database that just going like 1.5 x pop with like knotted hands um it can be can be is the best way of like when you have super values so I kind of stick with that I also wanted to look at that Jack nine hand quickly do is it Tech Nine is here so just see GTO doesn't mind it at all and actually that's cool uh does check cool the river uh so it's it's it's very much played GTA turn we just yeah sizing's fine no difference in EV so everything about the hand seems totally GTO and Sun bluffing on the river over the thing for obvious reasons um decent hand to Bluff with but yeah just cause um because when we look at his range of betting um like I said uh he's just going to be taken to the Queen of Diamonds uh even like yeah like King with the eight of diamonds so if he's like I'm blocking the king of diamonds for me which I would play like that then he was going to take Bluff so he's even bluffing King High in this spot and I expect people to maybe miss the king 8 as much but definitely taking these Queen X so they're gonna have a decent Bluff frequency um maybe they're missing too much of like the 10-2 type hand here um because not many people Bluff that one so yeah maybe maybe this is is closer to a fold where we take out a couple of these Bluffs oh 10-2 is not a bluff sorry okay cool he's not bluffing bottom pair not in that not not in that zone oh it is bluffing 70. so it's bluffing some bottom pairs eight two seven two yeah so for this reason probably is more of a fold and this is a good reason to look at the silver after even if it sells you oh yeah you did fine by calling it's good to see what expects people to Bluff and do they have those Bluffs in their range I do expect all of these Queen highs so I was like counting on those but I don't know if I'd expect a tube but some people might find it but is that full frequency and that's that's the big problem here um but it's a full frequency so then people would miss it at some frequency if it might be missing enough plus this is actually an interesting one because I think we've got the best hand to flop like a very high frequency 10 doesn't change much but the river it doesn't nothing comes in the space doesn't come in uh if you turned like 10 8 10 8 did come in sorry but the silver wants to check the river I I didn't I went all in um but when you think about he doesn't have much King X he doesn't have much a sex and blockbiting or or does make sense in this spot because this spot because he doesn't have enough asexual King X to defend against the jam we just want to either check and let him block his Miss Spades and we don't block low space because we've got a Jack of Spades and so uh yeah um so silver wanted to to play it the way I played at the Czech river which was interesting um here with the king queen uh I just I was thinking about just jamming on him um but then I thought we I get to close off action playing with my hand like king queen seems good um I open gem base 7 suited these stack sizes it looks fine um and here we've got a situation where he's bit half pot and I was thinking my standard is just to call if it was a heads up pop but then he hasn't got as much incentive to go big when someone's all in and it just looks like I'm kind of getting trapped here I'd never played with this player before and so I decided to to fold and see what what the opponent was betting the size of and he was trying to like level me and it didn't work and you'll see that G2 never Falls the Flop but it doesn't really consider a freeway pot as much so this is like the only big blunder you see in this session there's two blunders uh one being one that I could definitely justify and this one I also justify so both of them I I make more money than so we're suggesting so of the two blunders I'm pretty happy about that we'll get across the next one in a minute okay so don't notice player so I want to start off aggressive I like I said I showed him early stage I want to I want to start the dynamic as me as an aggressive player um yeah don't don't want to make it like a easy for a moment because it's quite easy to adapt from aggression to uh passive and you can also maximize your profit if someone doesn't adapt world to aggression right but if you start off a passive and it's hard to add in aggression I feel um so I I like to start off with an aggressive Dynamic and then reduce I think it just kind of does better for the the mental uh meta game of the game that you're an aggressive player so here I I do block uh straight but I do have a six of clubs my opponent called pretty quickly on the turn um I don't think having a club in my hand especially like six o'clock because we do block pretty much all of this holes by the river it's probably like pretty bad card to have and so I decided to not triple Bell and also like I think even like we don't block that king of King Club so if he has like King High flush drawer he just got there with King and so I think it's a good spot to to to just shut off and solve it agrees it's fine I think you can definitely be fine with bluffing but I think it prefers checking River given the way that the range kind of gots that gets there and again my opponent doesn't know much about me and this is against reg so if you have got a rig like and you want to start off with aggressive Dynamic just don't let them breathe for the beginning bits of the game and you're going to be doing pretty good uh Ace 10 I'm fine with Min raising or olymping definitely want to defend my limping range so I think it's fine there uh here just going to check down not there's no value to be had uh checking back on the king queen free Eve is fine I think it's 16b blinds are pretty content with checking can cool every single term but if he was to go 1.5 x I can call um especially when you get small like this uh here with the with the 910 and this this is a very GTO approved which I'll uh 10 so we will go in the Flop if you see I had like 910 is one of our biggest hands that we're going to be running dunking and so I do I was coaching a student the other day and I was talking about these connecting boards and you really want to dunk on these boards that are are like straight complete that you have like a decent range on and our opponent just doesn't have like what I mean straight as much because it's like I mean he's going to limp five five six off suit uh so he has got but it's just a board that's going to go check check but we hit and our range just doesn't always want it to go check check uh so hands like nine six nine five that also have Equity so if our opponent did have Kings or Aces um that was that he raises and we gave it all in we're pretty much flipping and so we just stop our opponent from going check check and realizing equity and for example he would check like 8X and 7x always whereas we don't allow that to happen by betting and we build a pot with a hand that can get all in and then some of the Bluffs it might take would be those like 10x and stuff like that um and I think they're fine to take two but as long as your opponent kind of knows that you also dunk these type of hands uh you I think it's a bit dangerous to just start dunking boards where you haven't set up the dynamic that you also don't really strong hands and so it's like a chicken egg thing I think it's definitely start with your value and then like you can balance it out with some some Bluffs okay so Ace isn't a big part of his range and actually this is my raise here a race here is uh so I go all in over his bet so when I check he he bets I go all in the silver wants to always raise but not all in as you see he wants to have 4.64 as you see he's got eight big blinds so he wants to go half his stack why does it want to do that it wants a hand like jacket never default it wants a hand like seven seven ten seven Jack never to fold and I think that makes complete sense um because we definitely like just have the best time because it's gonna be an open Gem and asex high frequency is he gonna call the Flop with some of his asex probably not our hands are such high Equity when he just calls the Flop that and he's gonna have a lot of like ax7x there he might just bet the turn to try and get this to show down but if we made a raise and he's got got shot with that um or some Equity with it then he's not going to fall to the small rereads but he's always going to fall to the bigger erase and so we want to and and we have some of the outs for some of those straight draws and so we us having a 10 here is really good for us to for the slow play a bit more uh uh and it just seems nothing's going all in other than nine six so nine six it kind of makes sense maybe because 10 is now a bad card for us but no 10 no 10's obviously a good card um maybe because we're blocking more over cars that he's going to have like Jack 10 and stuff like so or like Queen Queen 10 um so it's just the 10 being so good where the six is not as good uh and I think I think that's what it is but nonetheless Evie seems about the same right yeah it's a decent difference and it makes sense why it's a decent difference because we make those folds with uh we make ax a 7x fold okay here with Jack eight now it gets a c bet we can we can actually check raise gear in because we've got the over card and the open illustrate jaw but I still want to realize My Equity as much as possible if he wants to see bear and I probably wouldn't raise it raise it again but it would definitely be GTO approved to re-raise because he hasn't got much A6 in his range we've got one over in a straight draw and a back door flush draw so without the diamond it would never varies with the diamond I think it's fine because we also block some of his continuous stuff like Queen Jack and stuff like that I think River is is close so River's super close between um checking and check jamming against a bit or betting for Value ourself I decided to to to check and then just know that my opponent bits I'm just going to jam them off 9x and this is a this is the first spot that I really think is is quite good because we want to talk about what our opponent should and could call with and does he call with that and um so I definitely like just think that he's going to have 9x a ton here um given away it's played like check flop eight calms why wouldn't you check 9x again and then you put them to the test on the river and it really just depends if your finger opponent's gonna gonna fold the 9x or not so on the river it doesn't really check and it does do the 1bb sizing if the but with that 3.5 that it does check it likes the all in a lot with it 68 of the time just goes all in and it can still cool but a little bit more EV by GEM and all in so as long as I think like it's either between just bet ourselves a value because we've got a good hand um or or German or Lin I think this is pretty good because if we look at the range that he should be betting and stuff like that um again he's going to have 9x biggest part of his range it's going to be 9x and if we can make 9x fold uh I don't think it's great and also he's not supposed to fold a hand like Jack Nye do we think he's going to overfold it lightly um I think people will likely overfold uh definitely going to overfold hands like 9-7 and even hands like 10 4 10 3 like people potentially over 4ds they just don't have a blocker and they might not even entertain it where they're supposed to be calling off every time uh hands like Queen a even that um yeah Queen a queen nine if we can get over fools from these then we're going to be printing here um the only thing is you see eight two is supposed to fold I don't know if he at some frequency I don't think eight two is ever folding um yeah so that's that's not here no there but I don't think uh it would ever fold the someone would have ever folded there um the eight two not say anything in everyone's range but yeah I guess 80 suited would be in everyone's range um Queen 10 still limping I want to realize as much Equity like I said I've tried to put control like he put small uh here when our opponent uh here our opponent dancing to us here uh I I folded GTO wants a call here uh it's the first dog and this is why actually like aggression early on even works against someone like me right like I I don't know enough about my opponent's dunking range and so I don't want to test it I don't want to find it out this way yeah but I do think calling there would definitely be fine with the Queen of Hearts thus folds about a queen of hearts um so it the EV was no different as you see like it didn't come up as a blunder or anything um so yeah jump into King five Super standard I don't want to be missing these jams uh he ends up pulling off a worst hand uh but actually why for Queen 10 I think this is like just a bit too wide calling the queen 10 here um just slightly too wide against like so much damage because you're gonna run into a lot of those King Rags uh but you are going to run into Super connectors too so Queen 10 are like I mean GTO would be fine with it but like against me I think Kim cooler Queen 10 is totally good but against like population or against another rank would be different Okay so sizing um like I exploit go a bit smaller than half bot um I don't know actually silver probably does do a small size I didn't want to go one BB because I still wanted to get more money out of hansi just won't fold and then I felt like it also would set up if like if the river was a brick it wasn't a brick but if the river was like a nine I think that we we get hero calls quite a bit by the sizing because it does look a bit fluffy um so yeah that I I know the solver doesn't say anything about it as you see there's no no more blunders um so everything else should be fine we can still look at hands because we want to also talk about what people do uh when he limps at these stack sizes I'm very very suspicious and I just check back the King Nine and I want to get a showdown I want to see what he's doing he's got 4.7 BBC's limping uh there's no lymphs at 4.7 BBS so I really need to see what he's up to before and I can't believe he let I can't believe he let me win with King High and then like that's I don't don't ever let someone win with King High if you live five people lines uh he had a queen high but still you just see that range and I would fold because and then see instantly I changed him from being a reg to to an unknown if he's because my yellow is more like I'm not too sure so I put him as a very bit premature and I probably should have put him yellow um because uh it didn't know and so both those hundred regs didn't want to didn't want the smoke anymore and they decided to quit the hundreds so we had to start hunting for games again I think I pause it but we can wait till we get a game I just say okay so we get a game here we didn't miss nothing I'm not expecting to get 100 so I cover up the 100 expecting to get this 20 I think this 20 does pop off and um because I I remembered I'm supposed to be seeing 20s like why am I saying only hundreds and 50s Well yeah if I'd reread the message I would have also sat some some tens as well which would have been cool but at least this is kind of like more like the mistakes and it kind of can conclude our live grinds because we play a big range the last games we played the absolute micros and now we're playing mid mid steaks so yeah so there's no high stake anymore and um so here um this is a raise or a limp um a shallow effect I would raise it always like 15 and under and then a bit deeper I would um I just limp it it's it's not here not there EV is the same uh you can actually I I probably would mix it as well um I don't know who little pun is and that would be a big reason for limping it um because we would want to we've got insta insta position uh so money flows this way we're going to make Eevee on Lil punt given that he has a name like little punt probably just punting about a bit and yeah we want to I want to capitalize on that so now you see he's gone all in and like I still raise my good hands but I think limping here would even be good um but he's also going to be cautious because he's got a a recreational that I don't know if he knows or has notes on him um but we're going to we're both going to be very cautious against each other and it's going to be a bit more face up poker when we've got a recreational here because we're both trying to just capitalize the EV on the the third player because there's so much Eevee in the the unknown when he's not iRig so he's gone all in seems excited to go all in free a lot as I'm writing the note he goes all in so obviously it's cool because I'm I've got question marks on him already and he does go along with king 8. um had this been the first hand against the recreation I would fold king queen um and great now we've made the movie and he is still in the game so everything's great so now we definitely just want to be limping as our strategy against the the reg uh even with our better hands just to balance out a limping range um so let's see like naturally kind of leaning towards raising Eve is fine I've I've mixed because I limped the last hand and they're both mixed I would probably raise this one as a general but just not interested he can take this this there's no EV in the hand like me playing seven eight there there's no EV and you can see I'm pointing at this guy I'm saying this is my guy I'm no interest in I'm out of position I'm not looking to play Zero EV Sports out of position when I've got very plus EV spots against little pun and this is kind of like where people get a bit too ego and it's like oh well I want to put battle against the reg whatever no no no no no this is where you want to play against Little Pond and every port you can play against little pump because he is he's looking to Decay and even like 10 8 here like if I was to fold here like I wouldn't even hate it but I I know I don't but it would be like completely fine um but yeah this is the the this is the next hand that actually that that the solver says is a blunder actually but I don't believe it is and when we look at it it won't be a blunder when we actually analyze analyze it a bit deeper so check call check raise I think both are fine but check call majority of the time because I want to keep posts small again I'm saying look Lil pun's my guy here I'm after him I'm not really after him if I can make it straight on the turn if we make a pair on the turn thing is going to change obviously but I'm still just trying to read last message for as cheap as possible frenzy Fred is also probably going to be playing a very similar strategy to that and as he doesn't borrow a car that he probably should just Barrel because my range can't really defend against it like it has like 10 8 just have to fold six eight just have to fold um and then here's where the solver doesn't like my play it wants to just bet big with this hand is like this one hand that it wants to go all in now I want to tell a story to Fred frenzy Fred I want to say I've got a seven I don't think me going all in or bit import or three quarters pot tells the story that I have a seven I think it tells a story that I've got 10A and I'm desperate for him to fold so I use a size that is just like always a seven and then he can just make easy folds and [Music] um when we look at it so this is not the end that's not the end This Is the End so when you see the Vlog yeah cool 71 raise 27 EV is the same makes no different turn I did actually think about here betting the term because we have like the suit is 7-4 we have suited uh four two suited we've got like all the two pair combos that he just doesn't have and I actually did consider leading the turn I think that's okay and the river it's it's saying it's a minus 70 and why is it minus 70 because when we look at his range he's supposed to call pretty much always a king Jack sometimes Bluff he's supposed to Bluff with Jack 10 so at a high frequency it's going to be missing that uh he's supposed to have nine seven in his range he's not gonna have nine seven years range he's gonna bet the term with nine seven um so gonna be missing that part of his range and I think people were going to be over betting her with all the seven X's because I don't think he expects me to fat too many 9x and he's gonna protect his Equity so he's not going to have a lot of these hands that actually have big hands I don't think pocket sevens are going to check the turn uh I think they're just going to continue barreling through because again that but I have that 1080 in my range um so when we take into consideration he doesn't have these hands and he's going to overfold King Jack Jack 10 Queen 10 uh King Jack and possibly possibly I don't expect them to fold in Ace but possibly folded an ace I'm trying to think what did he fold like because pretty much all of his veins shouldn't fold and he just snapfolded and so when you think like yeah these are these these hands that we're just not going to be in his range and headaches always whistle Bluff jackets always whistle Bluff Queen aids always supposed to Bluff they're just going to be snap Folds so it makes actually my life very easy um for Block bet is to be the most optimal and um I like this so I don't I don't actually consider this a blunder I think it's actually a very well played hand especially when we want to keep our chips for as much easier we can make against um little pump but yeah he he folds so that's nice and sometimes we have to like step away from the silver a bit and think like what's our opponent really going to think because it'd be a great spot to exploit maybe Jam all in when you have a four right because our opponent's going to be like oh he's got 10 8 he's got 6A he's gonna like oh and just like maybe make a miracle with King Green right but against the block bat maybe he's like oh he's always got seven you know so we still want to not be like too married to the soldiers especially at the lower Stakes where you can actually think what my opponent would think when I bet this size and I think it kind of does lay down um but that's also why he should be bluffing so much because um maybe I have got7x there um and he wants to put me in complete uh like torture right um especially when it wants to check back pocket seven is on the turn and and uh actually has some decent hands checking back the turn he gets a little Pond and now we play a heads up always going all in here nothing to do other than going all in and we've got our second game and it's now going to be a 20 till a game and I think I'm just gonna exit quickly The 100 and the other 50. and and now we're with it okay so Ace a gonna be one of our better hero calling hands um when we check back I'm not interfering with clubs not interfering with 10x not interfering with Jack X so checking back is is pretty standard uh River ax a big part of our range um yeah just still and I'm gonna be bluffing here with a hand like uh like three four four five suited stuff like that I'm not gonna bet hands that don't have equity on the Flop or turn there because our opponent's gonna I would unblock all of his folds having twos and threes and fours and fives in my range and because those are the hands we would be targeting for folds and he would end up having just more like hands that can continue um here everything's fairly standard nothing to really talk about I miss anything here at these stack sizes I don't expect them to to Really Ever like check back Queen X especially on this like web board and now we have another situation uh we have another situation where we've got uh 9x being a big part of his range and do we want to do do you want to check cool not really and just got Perfect combo for a chick Jam um I think he should always be back calling off probably Maybe not maybe not then everything completes and I'm gonna have straights and flashes play the exact same so I think he played it good to check back there actually um but he would have got my stack had he but he bet but yeah he might be in the test spot and then forced to fold so yeah I think his check back is actually very good here I make a big exploit actually I don't think it's even that big of a split I I definitely want to call flop because if a diamond comes but I'm already very very very very very skeptical of a unknown player betting this big on the flop in the 20 game and when he goes his size on the turn I am out of here everything's just kind of got there I didn't actually see this hand come up I did and must be GTA approved because we've got okay it doesn't say yeah here fold 77 and so actually I thought it was exploit it's not an exploit um so yeah we played it good there and yeah just making sure we're not getting married just because we've got top pair we don't have to cool down you just see the silver folds because look um his range here's what order two pairs all the straights got all the sets uh we do not we don't need to defend our range that much and so like we literally just don't even need to defend even top pair we want to be defending hands like well King Jack wouldn't wanted to fold King Nine wouldn't want to fold uh hands that have some of this size B because he might bet the size of like King a um whereas he's not gonna put it with King free for example um four six this is the most interesting hand of the whole video four six we can probe here we can probably I think that's fine um and I think I should have probably probed but I also quite like exploiting people's delay because I don't think he's got many straight drawers we do block some straight so if you check back a straight draw we block and now we were just putting pressure on 8X uh that wants to bet turn maybe some 10-4 type hand with maybe some like nine seven type hand that did check the the Flop we don't interfere with that um so originally I was thinking we just have a bottom end um and then we decided to to raise it uh definitely going to be one of our best Bluff combos because when the top end fills in we fully represent it very very strong like all of our Bluffs filled in here other than four six and someone would really have to dig deep to think somebody's raising the term oh yeah also Spades but Spades probably would shut off always on us on a queen here and so pretty much most of my Bluffs I just don't have that many Bluffs left and we get to fold and it is again GTO approved it's hardly ever checking but mainly just probing the turn which obviously EV seems exactly pretty much the same um but if we do check it's either folding which I would have done but once I realized that double got I went for the raise and it likes it a lot and the all-in is yeah also approved uh you can block bet and you can go all in and or you could check so all seem fine but it's nice to have these kind of things and you ask them because other regs don't have them in their awesome so again I guess a fish I wouldn't be trying to pull this move uh or a recreation should I call them I don't like cool people fish so um but I wouldn't really play this line against the recreational biggest of reg we really want to put into the test uh make their life hard right we just even if he calls me there I've got a good Dynamic you know that's a good Dynamic for going ahead against him um and we've been win a big pot when he does fold here two overs in the gut shot so shallow I can't bet call of rays um so if I can't bear call away wave raised when I've got Equity I don't want to bet um that's kind of my rule there on the turn we don't represent much I think we're going to get a lot of check raises off goodregs anyway if we bet turns so you see I consider betting but then I think actually my life's better my life's better checking and realizing My Equity and I can Bluff loads of cards obviously I complete with a six a seven a five all those hands all those cards are good for my range and I can Bluff um like pretty much any other card because I've got all the other cards in my range too so like it ends up being a very good spot to like check check but um and I wouldn't go Polo on the river I'd probably go like 1.5 to represent if like a like a 10 or something came or or a king or something I got good like 1.57 I've got that that movie card and I'm trying to get value I consider free betting nine six and then I opt against it uh again because I just don't know anything about him I don't need to don't need to go there yet King Nine run into Kings um I think the open Jam is fine limp cooling gems fine uh probably more than towards the limp but just again keeping that aggressive aggression up is pretty good so this is actually a very very interesting spot too so we've called The Flop as you see and then the tone comes tone comes a card this is the raised pot so I think people want people are going to oversee bet this board because he doesn't have as many flushes as I have and so he should definitely have a checking range even if the aside board and when I ran people see betting this 100 which I think most people will um it actually check razors some button pairs um because uh our hand just does better um because it just follows out all of his like even stuff like uh King a etc that just doesn't have a speed now on the term when the Spade comes I like to take the bottom of my my calling range flop and turn it into a donk I've got the King of Spades I've got the Queen of Spades in my range and it just doesn't really this is quite easy for him just to like overfold against and um or just not have anything to defend it because he oversee bet the flop because we're assume we need to see bitten 100 so he's going to have handsets don't connect at all and he's just going to have hands that just don't have a spade in it a high frequency um so um we do have space we don't have air and that's the thing here we just don't have any air our range improves and so taking like this nine and turn it into a bluff it like I feel like it's pretty good okay it's teacher approved also a bit dozen oh it doesn't really take it but the EV is fine and like 1.2 and as you see yeah like what kind of hands it's just the bottom of the range there's 10 8 even without a spade um hands that just like the bottom of orange and then mix in with some obviously some flushes like Queen term with a spade and stuff like that so it's it's it's this is what I like to take especially when I know my population are going to be like oversea but in this board anyway and I can do a lot of maneuverability on those boards so I think that's all of the most interesting spots anyway so all right guys peace and good luck uh love to see the faces that come weekly uh nice one have a good one

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assassinato and today we are going to be discussing bluffing strategies in online poker tournaments let's do some quizzes see which ones of these you think are bluffs see which ones of these you think are checks are giving up opportunities let's get to work so you raise 9-8 off suit on the button and the big blind calls you the board comes ten five seven it's been checked to you Checker bet five seconds all right that's time we decide to bet two big blinds into seven two ten into 650. the turn is the two of diamonds it's checked to you here would you like to check her back five seconds that is time we decide to bet 810 into 1070. the big blind calls the river is the Ace of Spades it is checked to us here would you like to check her back all right that is time if you did decide to bet how much did you want to bet we decided about four thousand into two thousand six uh 2690 here and our opponent Folds well this one we can go through very quickly when a person check calls you on a board with flush draws and stray draws especially many loose recreational tournament Players many of them would check raise or raise with their two pair sets are better to simultaneously get money from their hand and to protect their hand so when they just check call they often have just one weak pair so when the board Runs Out verily very poorly for the majority of their Pairs and combination wise what pair they have most of the time is a pair that shares a card with the board when the board runs out very poorly for those pairs you should keep firing and a 10 or a seven here did not want to see that flush draw come in and did not want to see that ace of spades on that River so we continued to apply pressure let's try another one we have two five of diamonds somewhat of a loose player goes ahead and raises here would you like to fold color rights that is time we decide to call here the board comes Queen three three check about that's time we check and villain 439 goes ahead and fires 1080 into 2160 here would you like to fold color raise that is time we decide to raise here to 3360. in villain 439 Falls so the reason we're doing that if we check raise about the size of the pot that bet is a complete Bluff needs to work about 50 percent of the time and our opponent here if they're opening too many hands has likely missed this board north of 50 percent of the time so unless they're willing to call us down here with uh High cards or unless they're willing to Bluff again we are very likely to get this Bluff that through because most loose players especially at low to mid six games especially with recreational players they open a little too much the continuation about a little too much and the reason they do that is most of the time nobody really tests them on that so we go ahead and weed stack raise here because we could have some threes in a Range it's a little less likely they have a three when they raise from that early of a position but it wouldn't be inconceivable if we had four three suited five three suited six three suited something like that an ace three off something like that we also could theoretically be check raising a queen for Value uh hard draws for Value although a lot of people in practice won't actually do that but making it a bit more basic a lot of the times this person just more than half the time has nothing and is not going to do anything about it so we go ahead and do this check race Bluff here we have King two of diamonds villain 13 raises villain 13 has been very loose what would you like to do here with the King two of diamonds all right that is time we do decide to raise to 8.71 big blinds villain 13 calls the board comes King six six it is checked to us here would you like to check about five seconds that is time we decide to check here the turn is the eight of spades villain 13 checks here would you like to check her butt that is time we go ahead and bet 9.14 big blondes and villain 13 calls the river is the three of Spades it's been checked to us here here would you like to check about that's time we fire again 12 big blinds we checked on the flop versus a loose opponent in the hopes of getting them to Bluff bet on the term when it didn't work we decided to fire ourselves but we three bet primarily though this hand isn't good enough to cold call but it works as a bluff because it does have a lot of equity it does have enough equity to three bat Bluff with we would like to set up as many of our pots as possible with position bigger pot Superior hands heads up but if we have to Forfeit one of those if we have half a hand but we have position with a bigger pot heads up versus somebody who has just way too many hands and they're so likely to miss a vast a lot of the time that's a pretty good situation to set up now in this particular situation we did hit a very weak top pair so we did decide to go ahead and try to get the person back into us but when they didn't decide to do that we did decide to go ahead and bat ourselves we go ahead and go for a thin value bet on the river because when a flush draw misses a lot of low to mid-stakes players will say to themselves well maybe he has a Miss flushra that's just a good enough excuse to call so here we have nine seven of hearts in the small blind here would you like to full call arrays all right that is time we go ahead and raise here and we get called by the big blind the board comes King two eight here would you like to check about all right that is time we fire 260 into 760 big blind calls the turn is the five of clubs here would you like to check her butt all right that is time decide to fire 690. and he folds this is a situation you should do a lot of double barreling on because on a big block the big blind player knows you raise a lot from the small block so they're going to call you a lot in the big line so they have a very wide range there and they know you're going to be continuation betting the majority of the time on most flops so they should float you with a lot of just random High cards and back doors and whatnot that means they still don't have much of anything on many turn cards and if you fire again A lot of times they'll go all right all right I guess you do have something so those were all Bluffs that were fun to explore let's tie it all together here bluffing strategies and online poker tournaments do you want to learn how to Bluff more in online poker tournaments let's get to work try these strategies in your next session to gain more chips when you've been dealt absolutely nothing when your opponent flats from the big blind they are likely doing that with half the deck no one wants to fold from the big blind they're getting too big of a discount it's too tempting to see the flop what does this mean for you this means your opponent is likely going to flop a high card or a mediocre pair the majority of their flopping range doesn't want to see you betting multiple streets against them disappoint them let them see multiple shells let them see over bats you should be especially willing to fire against them when they flat you on suited coordinated boards if they call your small continuation bet on a board with a flush draw in straight draw it is likely they only have pairs or draws they likely would have raised their two pairs or sets to simultaneously get value from their hands and also protect them when they just call you it is far more likely they have one of their many awkward pairs what they don't want to see from you is another huge bet disappoint them no one wants to call huge bets out of position with awful pairs exploit that you should also fire more when you have the nuts in your range but they don't have the nuts in their range a good example of that is when the Flop comes Ace King 3 rainbow if Ace King 3 rainbow if they just called your rays out of the big blind then it is unlikely they have Aces Kings and Ace King however you have all those hands in your range if you were the pre-flop razor make them miserable with their mediocre pairs shell them with huge bets when you have this situation this is another reason we might want to check raise a little bit more have you ever seen an opponent who likes to check back their mediocre pairs they'll even do that sometimes with their top pairs they are hoping for you to Bluff On the Turning River they don't want to bet their hands themselves because they're afraid of being raised so going back to that earlier hand where we check raise from the big blind if our opponent actually was going to check a number of mediocre pairs in that situation that makes their continuation betting range even more likely to be premiums are just crap and there's a lot more crap than there are premiums don't believe paw controller is one they bet this kind of player leaves an exploitative opening let's say you're in the big line and this player raises from the cutoff you call from the big blind your no you know your opponent likely has opened 25 percent of hands from the cutoff the board comes King of Spades seven of diamonds three of diamonds you check your opponent that's small your opponent is screwed here their wide late position opening range has missed this flop the majority of the time what's even worse for them is that they would check many of their weaker Kings in some sevens this makes their continuation betting range a bunch of garbage and some sets check raise this opponent sometime you'll be amazed by how often they fold re-race people who open too much this is one of the most basic Bluffs but this guide wouldn't be complete without it there are players in poker tournaments who constantly Open Hands they shouldn't it's as if their job is to get involved out of position you should exploit these players as much as possible when they're opening their garbage suited gappers you should constantly put them to the test re-raise in position and watch them squirm post flop once they call you post flop they have indicated to you that they likely don't have premium hands many players would forbet their Aces and kings in the hopes of winning a huge pot since you can eliminate a number of the bigger over pairs that means you can continuation Bluff the boards that aren't riddled with high cards if your opponent does decide to defend versus you and calls on the Flop then you can check back the tournament and take two more cards if you catch up then you'll have a huge pot in front of you your opponent is likely to call your value bet so let's discuss this one just a little bit so let's say you have somebody opening a little bit too much you three bet them as a bluff and they call you pre-flop they should on occasion do that with Aces or Kings just so that's in their uh flooding range when they flat three bats just so it just to make that range A Little Bit Stronger they don't have to do it all the time but they got to throw that in on occasion but in a practice a lot of people won't do that so you can just rule out the really big over pairs when you three bet them and they just call you pre-flop versus many players now on the Flop if they just check call you on some kind of coordinated board that also lets you know it's pretty likely they don't have the bigger hands because a lot of people would check raise with their two pairs in their sets to simultaneously get money from their hand and protect their hand if they were flush runs or straight rods out there and if all else fails and they check if they just check call you on the Flop you're gonna get two free cards because a lot of the times they'll check the turn to you and you can just check and you can take your Turner River and that is a lot of equity man just to add extra cards like that which is another reason we want to be three betting in position continuing double barrel frequent floaters versus basic opponents your continuation bets on the Flop will usually get them to fold their High cards however there are certain situations where your opponents will not want to fold their High cards one great example of this comes up when the board is very hit or miss let's say you open a five six suited from the small blind or bought it the big blend calls the board comes king2 rainbow your big blind opponent checks to you and you continuation back they call this is a board where you should heavily consider double barreling whether your opponent is out of position or not doesn't matter if they like if they have a high card or back door draw they're unlikely to go anywhere they know on that board you either have a king or nothing they're gambling on nothing they also want to call because that's a more fun way to play and to be fair you raise from a later position with a wider range so it's more likely you miss that board if you're going to continuation about this board you should consider double barreling as well especially if the turn card comes a blank your opponent is likely to have nothing and will fold they're far more likely to take the turn Barrel seriously as opposed to the automatic flop that's so unpacking this one just a bit let's say you raise that five six suited from the button somebody calls you from the big blind the board comes king2 they check to you A lot of people are just gonna check call you there a lot of the time in the hopes that you'll check the turn and they can just fire a river and pick it up a lot similarly they'll do the same thing if you raise from the small blind they're in the big blind they're in position they want to see if you can check that turn and then they can just pick up the pop right there on those boards where it's super hit or miss and a lot of people do just want to call uh to see what you do on the turn go ahead and fire a second bet it's going to work a lot for you all right guys that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this one I'll see you for the next one of these take care good luck to you if you're playing today", metadata={'source': 'YwsViYjII88', 'title': '4 Bluffing HACKS To CRUSH At

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assassinato and today we are going to be discussing three mistakes to avoid an online cash games let's get to work so first let's start you're playing a cash game of your choosing and you have seven eight of spades under the gun right here would you like to fold call or raise just a few more seconds we're going to start with a fundamental if you said call here you might want to rethink that villain 3 now has a very easy isolation raise what do you do let's say you call here now the board comes King six two what do you do that is time we decide to check here and villain three goes and fires and there's not a whole lot we can do at this point it's hard for us to represent a lot of the better Kings because we probably would have raised pre-flop with those hands we've limped and gotten ourselves in a trap we're starting with a real fundamental here today guys but I can't tell you how many times in private lessons this still comes up which is actually I was just talking about this with a client today and what happens is when we're we're playing really passive when we're playing very passive live games in the home games we start in are sometimes at a local casino in a smaller Market we can get away with limping a lot of hands because nobody's really going to raise us off those hands but in online cash games we're gonna get raised off of our hands quite a bit we're going to be in this situation quite often where we're just playing defense and we can't represent much of anything and when you miss there's going to be nothing you can really do you're gonna have to fold and your opponent is just going to be able to take advantage of all the times you're missing which is quite frequently which is going to set you up for a lot of hurt okay let's try a more advanced hand so villain 3 has been pretty loose pretty damn aggressive so far and you have 10 eight of spades you decide to call here out of the big blind and the board comes Ace eight five here would you like to check her back just five seconds okay that is time you decide to check and he goes in bats I meant to give you five seconds on this decision sorry okay you knew the bat was coming right okay here's five seconds obviously most of you are checking there I really needed a sip of my direct my apologies okay all right here I know most of you are calling now let's make things a little trickier uh the five of Spades turns here check her bet we decide to check and villain three goes in fires would you like to fold color raise just a few more seconds okay that is Thai we decide to call and the river is the Queen of Clubs check about that is time we check and villain three goes and Bets 32.5 big blinds it is on you you have 10 seconds all right that is time we do decide to call and here we caught our opponent with pocket sevens what do you think of that of our opponent's play well you're going to be dealing with more loose aggressive players in online cash games so you really need to be prepared for that he's doing some simple we could debate his play or not I'm not going to do that but what he's figuring out here is a lot of times on that super coordinated board with flush draws and straight draws you likely would have fast played a lot of your two pairs a lot of your sets so when you just check call on that flop you are most likely holding a pair additionally how good is that pair likely you would have three bet Ace King maybe Ace Queen a lot of the really good Aces so villain 3 has made a determination that your range is mostly weak pair so he has decided Well I wonder if he is going to be willing to fold some of those wheat pairs now we could debate whether that idea is going to work uh long term depending on the stakes you're at or depending on the history you guys have or a hundred other factors but the focus of this hand is you will see more people put pressure on you in online cash games so you really need to be prepared for that that if they know your range is capped at pretty weak pairs you have to expect pressure and there's going to be a lot of times you have to make call Downs that you don't normally do okay let's do another hypothetical here so here you have Jack four of clubs and you've gone ahead and raised on the button the big blind goes ahead and calls you here and the board comes King 10-5 it gets checked to you here would you like to check her bet that is time we decide to bet 210 and big blind goes ending calls the turn is the seven of diamonds it has been checked to us here here would you like to check her back time is up the river is the Jack of Hearts he checks to you it's on you would you like to check or bet 10 seconds all right that is time we do decide to fire here about oh seven big lines into eleven and he calls and he turns over the 10 six of Hearts now why do we fire that River well we fire that River for a very simple reason let's think about the play of the hand so on the Flop we do a traditional continuation that which we can get away with he's calling with a lot of the deck there out of the big line and check folding a lot of it and we don't have to dive too deep into that so once he checked calls though on that board that's not really a board where a lot of people just call with just a random high card they obviously some backdoor draws would call though to be fair but a lot of times this is going to be some kind of pair and a lot of those pairs are not going to want to fold to the random seven of diamonds turn I don't even know if a five of Spades is that worried the f I mean the five is that word excuse me if he matched with the five of Spades because he could just say to himself oh he could be double barely another flush draw or stretcher or something along those lines so probably not going to have a lot of success especially at lower Stakes here uh firing again on this turn that versus opponents that are more into being a station and a good way to think of this is if you're playing against opponents who are stations you want to be a net a little bit more so there's sometimes Bluffs that theoretically you'd like to take that you just can't take as much versus opponents that just love to call a Todd so yeah nits beat station so we're gonna be we're gonna knit it up a little bit here not not try again but when he checks on this River he likely would have led most of his Kings for Value so we have to know our Jack is good but you'll see a lot of people just check back here because they're really worried about a check raise that isn't going to come that often in even if it did come you wouldn't even be that worried about it because a lot of people won't try the ultra super duper slow play so a lot of times that's just frustration so yeah this really does need to be a bat now we did go ahead and bat here and we get called by the 1060 Hearts Let's wrap this all up and let's discuss online cash so online cash is there anything better than online cash you can play a massive amount of hands you can play it any hour day or night it's like an eternally card arcade game for money what's not to love however if you make these three key mistakes you won't have fun playing online cash games let's discuss them today so you can have more fun on the virtual fell it's tempting to call down without a plan we know we're supposed to defend the big blind versus small raises the problem we face is we're defending with such a wide range we mostly miss the flop and hit weak pairs our opponents know this so they shell us with huge bats we end up not knowing what to do we call down hopelessly and get value back to death The Simple Solution to this situation is to play less hands out of position that works fine in the short term but as we get better however we need to learn how to defend ourselves out of positions such as the hand we saw today I prefaced it with this person has been loose aggressive so we probably did need to call down a lot more than normally we'd like to one rule of thumb we can use is most people can't triple barrel block that that really goes through especially with I find that if the person has recreational markers at all like they're just limping in a little bit more they're calling a little bit more pre-flop than they should a lot of those folks do have a problem triple barrel bluffing as much as they should so in general I'll give them the benefit of the doubt the first time but continuing obviously we showed a situation where we did not give someone the benefit of the doubt so that does happen too if you see the person is capable of being loose aggressive so recapping one rule of thumb we can use is most people can't triple barrel Bluff almost everybody can continuation bet Bluff on the Flop some people can bet the turn is a bluff not many people can fire the river as an absolute Bluff when we're playing an unknown player we should give them the benefit of the doubt the first time especially if we're playing lower Stakes if we're a little too tight on later streets to start the session that's fine once we identify a player as a maniac we can change our strategies we can pick any halfway decent top pair and called out and we do have to really be prepared to call down if we believe the person is going to identify while this person is weak here uh their their range is capped I better fire calling down without a plan however until a player proves themselves to be capable of advanced play we're not going to give them credit we'll play our big pots in position until further notice playing too many hands from early position playing too many hands from early position is a great way to lose a ton of money in online cash games some players like to limp their small Pairs and suited gappers from early position this is generally a losing play it would would be better to raise or fold with those hands when you're starting to play online cash games you should strive to play tighter from early position when you open with so many players to act behind you it is likely someone will pick up a solid hand if they three bet you then they have put you in a disadvantageous position if you call out of position you're only trying to save the big lines you already put in the pot it will be massively difficult to make a profit from out of position so what I mean by that is if you open in somebody three betsu and you've opened too many hands oftentimes your best case scenario is just saving a couple of the big lines you put out there are just half of the big lines he put out there are something along those lines trying to turn a profit is actually immensely difficult if they did catch you with so many hands out of position and they did just three bet you unless you have a very good check racing game dock leading game uh just bluffing game floating game you have great out of position work there it's going to be very difficult to turn any kind of profit so you just don't want to get taught in that situation if you don't have to the best way to neutralize your opponent's positional Advantage is to catch them with solid hands if you open Ace Queen Plus or 8A Plus for example and they three bet you then you will still be able to make money these hands flop well and allow you to win more pots that is one way you can make money if somebody three bets you is just having very good hands obviously that sounds really basic but if you're opening really garbage suited gappers and getting caught getting three back consistently and everybody knows you're opening too wide from early position it's going to be really hard to make money but yes if you did have a solid range if you just went wow everybody's three betting me quite a bit here let me revert to a more solid range it doesn't have to be this solid this is very solid Ace Queen plus eight eights plus but if you were to revert to a more solid range then you could be in a much better shape should you get through that if no one is three betting at your table then you can open up your game however if people at your table are constantly re-raising you then find another table or tighten up your ranges let's say say you do get a pre-flop race through and the big blind calls you this is the moment you've been waiting for now someone has called you out of position with a wide range they're going to be guessing on most flops if they check to you in position which they are likely to do 90 plus percent of the time then you can take a free card whenever you want one or start betting when you like the Flop this is a huge Edge if you if you flop a top pair or even a solid second pair you need to start thinking about value betting versus the big one flatter the big line flatter has called you out of position with a wide range they've hit the Flop poorly almost always they have high cards and mediocre pairs the vast majority of the time the last thing this player wants to see is you betting disappoint them introduce them to several bets try to go for three streets at every opportunity you're not value-betting enough until you accidentally value bet the second best hand the entire point of Poker is to capture the other players chips the biggest bets in the limit No Limit Hold'em are river bets you can't win a river bat from another player with a bluff you'll need to Value bet them I guess you could if somebody bats the river as thinly and then you raise them okay yes you did capture a river bat with a bluff but those situations come up a lot less often than just value-betting someone who doesn't want to fall that that's going to come up a lot more often so you really want to make sure if you're trying to secure those nice big River Bats the biggest bats in element hold them that will frequently come from just value betting like we saw in the hypothetical we discussed today online cash games are great fun and if you use these three tips they will be even more enjoyable just remember to play your big pots in position and value bet thinly versus why big blind calling ranges don't get out of line when you're out of position or likely to be out of position conclusion if you're forced to play out of position have a clear plan of attack before you start calling huge bats on later streets follow all of these tips and you will win more alright guys that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this one I'll see you for the next one of these take care good luck to you if

[Document(page_content="hey guys Lexi Gavin here and today we are going to talk about how to study poker so the game of poker is constantly evolving the pros are getting better every single day and in general the game's just getting tougher every single day so it's really really important to keep a structured study schedule make sure you're studying roughly between 50 of the time and playing 50 of the time and just making sure to slowly over time try and plug as many leaks as you can possibly plug in your game so let's jump right into the presentation here and talk about how to go about studying poker so I'm going to list for you a few techniques that I use if you're playing online you should be using a hand tracking system and going back and studying every hand that you've played now I know this seems tedious and a lot of work but really there aren't that many hands in a session that you you're playing for big pots so if you have a hand tracking system you can go and filter it by amount one and then you can go and study all of your hands that you've played a significant pot in so you can go about it doing that way I like to even study my pre-flop mistakes and so just to make sure that I'm not you know I don't have any leaks in my pre-flop game so I'll study hands that I've even folded pre-flop in if you you know find that that's overwhelming you can just start with the big hands and then slowly going into those tedious little pre-flop spots so that's one way to go about studying another way is when you're not in a hand so when you're playing at a table a live table or online you should be observing everything that's going on in the hand even if you're not in it so what I like to do is I like to watch I like to try and make reads on my opponents when I'm uh just sitting back and I like to try and put people on ranges this is a really really good effective tool to to use that'll help you get better at reading hands and reading your opponents so when you're paying attention when you're on your phone and not paying attention you're missing out on uh reads from your opponents you're missing out on showdowns that you should be taking note of you're missing you know sometimes people will show their cards if they've made a big Bluff and if you're in your phone or not paying attention then you're gonna miss on those spots and those spots add up that they can really help increase your win rate if you are watching all of the action at the table so I know it's hard and I know it's easy to get distracted in poker but what try and you know do use that as an exercise when you're not in the hand you should be trying to range your opponents so again it's just a really effective method to try and help you learn how to hand read and make reads on your opponents so pay attention to every hand another way to study of course is hire a coach um you know you can join training sites and that's great but there's really something about having one-on-one coaching and having a coach watch your hand histories that'll really help improve your game so there are a bunch of different poker coaches out there with different rates and we have a lot of them here to choose from so definitely consider hiring a coach I know it's pricey but you have to consider the money that you're investing in poker as tuition so another really good way to study is by joining a poker group chat and running hand histories by your friends I find that this is a really helpful way to bounce ideas off of your friends and people that are better than you by far I think the best the thing that improved my game the most was talking hand histories with players that are better than me you have to kind of put your ego aside and not be afraid to even if you feel embarrassed not be afraid to ask that question to your friends like I have been playing poker professionally for 12 years and I still get confused and I still I'm in a poker group chat and my friends are sending me even pre-flop hand spots that they're confused about so there's nothing to be embarrassed about all the pros get confused um so definitely consider joining um a group chat if you don't have friends in poker there's forums you can use like two plus two so really try and get involved in the community so if you have a hand that you're confused about you know run it by friends and see what they have to say also when you're at the table if you're playing live you should be writing down your hand histories that you're confused about and then run it by your friends or your coach or review them yourself off the phone and when you're playing tournaments you always want to double check your bust out hands just go back and review the hand that you busted out in and make sure that it was a good spot and see if there was something else you can do better so I've created a four-step study plan for you to follow when you're going about studying poker step one pick your topic so you're going to write down all of the different topics of Poker you need help with and then you're gonna pick one of those topics and try and delegate one week to studying that one area Okay so step one pick your topic step two learn your topic so you're going to be studying and researching your topic all week you want to learn everything you possibly can you know you want to watch videos ask your friends about certain spots review those spots that's in the hands you play read books on this topic blogs Post in poker forums like two plus two so try and research and learn as much as you can about that topic so step three record everything that you've learned about that topic get a notebook and start writing down the important points you learned on that topic and when you're playing poker write down the hands you played relating to that topic and review them later and then step four simple rinse and repeat so you're just going to repeat this process with a new topic every week if you're dedicating one topic per week and really studying and honing in on that one spot then you're gonna become an expert in that topic and you're gonna feel really comfortable moving on to that next topic because you've spent a week learning it right and if you have if you're confused about what topics you should be learning um you should write down every every aspect of Poker that you feel like your game needs help with you know for me um I had a lot of trouble in uh blind versus blind spots so I spent like a week or two just studying that one topic and then moving on to another so I've created a study map for you uh these are just topics that I recommend you starting with in the order that I recommend so at first you want to nail down your fundamentals so these are your raise first in ranges pot odds bankroll management stack to pot ratio Etc so those fundamental concepts you should have an understanding of each one of those before you move on to pre-flop play which brings me to the next area of focus have a strong understanding of your prefix slot play so you should know exactly which hands you should be opening and which hands you should be folding like your race first in ranges should be so automatic to you that you don't want to spend brain power thinking about it they should just you should just know and it should just be automatic so you should know exactly which hands to open and which positions which hands you should be folding uh and so on and so forth you also want to play around with the odds and equities but we'll get into that a little bit later I'll show you some Equity calculators and other tools you can use but you definitely want to have an idea of the odds and equities in poker before moving on to more more advanced concepts okay so once you're confident in your fundamentals and pre-flop play you want to start working on your flop strategy this includes things like hand classes I don't know if you've watched my course on continuation betting but I talk about hand classes in there um that's just grouping the different types of hands together and having an idea of which hands you should be checking and which hands you should be betting in certain situations so continuation bad strategy calling C bets range Advantage so these are all things that you should be studying after you've nailed down the fundamentals um so definitely start working on these once you've nailed down these Concepts start working on your three bet game so you want to study which hands to three bet pre-flop and which hands to call three bets with so once you feel comfortable on your flop strategy we can now start moving into turn strategy so you also want to think in terms of hand class on the turn as well you want to learn which hand should be checks and which hands should be turned C bets which hands you should maybe start DeLay seabedding So now that you're confident in your turn strategy we're going to move on to River play so you need to understand when you should be bluffing Rivers when your draws bricked when you should be value betting Rivers when you should be calling Rivers when you should be Bluff catching on Rivers so you're you really want to focus on every different scenario that can happen on the river and feel confident so now that you understand the fundamentals and have a basic understanding of pre-flop flop turn and River strategy you can start working on more advanced concepts like check raising implied odds blockers blind versus blind play Draw Play strategy those things you should be studying individually so learn what are implied odds what are you know some learn what your check raising strategy should be and really focus on that each week so you'll also want to have a basic understanding at first at least of various poker softwares there's a whole bunch of them and I know solvers and stuff you know can be really intimidating but there are plenty of training videos out there that will walk you through how to use them so just some examples of some softwares you can use are Equity calculators like poker cruncher and Ecolab hand tracking programs like poker tracker and just a tip for anybody playing online there's a program called table ninja that if so if you are going to multi-table table ninja is a program where you can use your keyboard to help make your decisions faster so when I had it set up I would have my spacebar fold for me I'd have the alt button raised to three times the big blind so it's just a way to make your life a little bit easier and get your bets out there faster and then there's solvers like pile solver munker that you want to have an understanding how to use so I want to show you guys an example of a equity calculator when I first started playing poker I would just play around with these a lot there's this there's poker cruncher and some others so I would just choose some hands and let's say let's take Ace King for an example and I would enter it there and then take the next hand say I had a hand like pocket nines and I would run the equities just to give me an an idea of My Equity versus people's hands or people's ranges and it's just a good way to it seems tedious but it's a good uh way to practice knowing your equity in certain situations so let's take nine ten of diamonds uh put it up again six five Suited let's evaluate that so 99 diamonds has 62 percent equity roughly verse um six five suited so play around with this you can also do this verse ranges so let's take um say you have a hand like uh pocket tens right say you open uh in the cut off and the small blind um goes all in for 20 big blinds right so let's uh so we're entering our hand pocket tens and then we're gonna do um hand range selection and we're gonna think about what hands our opponent is going to be shoving in the small blind when we open versus um uh when when they have a 20 big blind stack so let's say this is roughly the range that they're going to be shoving when we open I'm doing this fast I might be missing some stuff so maybe every pair um maybe not Deuces uh so roughly this seems about right maybe shoving king queen this seems a little bit loose um but close so you want to hit apply and then evaluate and then you can see that pocket tens has roughly 60 Equity versus the range that we think the small blind is shoving right with 20 big blinds so play around with this if I know you know like I said solvers solvers are intimidating but if you can at least get a poker Equity calculator and start playing around with this this is a really good way to study and get better at poker so I guess I just want to say poker is an extremely complicated game the pros are getting better every single day and you really if you want to be a successful in poker you have to study and have to work on your game consistently Um poker is also about volume so the more volume you you put in the better off you're going to be um you know you it helps balance out the variants the more you play and if you are studying and putting a lot of work in your game it will pay off so just keep it up and um yeah just enjoy the ride too you know don't look at studying as uh something annoying that you have to do but an exciting oh I get to learn new methods and strategies and you know test them out at the table always and that's another thing when whatever you learn it's really hard to when you're in game like try and apply what you've learned in every spot but you really have to work on that so you could study 100 off the table and then when you're playing uh you you know if it's not going to benefit you if you're not applying what you've learned when you're in game so really try and work on that um you know like that's why the one week per Topic thing works really well because you can really focus on those spots and say to yourself when you're playing for that week okay if you're studying small blind play you're really going to pay attention to every hand that you're playing in the small blind um watch all of the hands that your opponents are playing from the small blind and um you know slowly over time you're gonna cover all the topics and you're gonna feel really confident in your game so that wraps up today's presentation on uh how to study poker I hope you guys enjoyed it if you have any questions uh feel free to get at me at Lexi gavinpoker on Twitter and Instagram so have a nice day and good luck in your games bye", metadata={'source': 'iGRz3HAO97o', 'title': 'How To STUDY Poker [With Lexy Gavin-Mather]',

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or assassinato and today we're going to be discussing adjusting from online tournaments to cash games we will also be discussing some of the differences between online tournaments and cash games let's get to work adjusting from online tournaments to cash games are you looking to transition from online tournaments to cash games you've come to the right place let's discuss some quick fixes that can help you transition effectively today now this is going to be a fun one to do guys because I I've been lucky enough to have had some success in both Fields I play a lot lower Stakes though generally than a lot of people so uh not to get too much into my credentials but I I do have W Coupe and scoop ones i i dub I do have WPT and EBT final tables my most recent win was the 250k guaranteed but I play mostly low to mid Stakes tournaments so I know the problems a lot of you are actually facing I also play a lot of low stakes cash I just like to multi-table and really grind it out like that so there are really key differences though between the two formats that you don't hear people discuss enough office maybe should be discussed because it really they're very different games and when I play those two different games they it's almost you have to become a different player in each of them so we'll discuss those today I'll give you what's worked for me over the years so here's the big thing in cash games this took me a really long time to learn but you have time in poker tournaments players are rewarded for firing their chips in constantly the Blind and Annie structure is severe picking up orphan pots is immensely important in this environment attacking and sometimes slightly Reckless poker is rewarded for these reasons many tournament Players get used to playing loose and aggressive constantly so let me give you an example of that so a lot of times my friends say oh I oh I want to watch you play past game poker I bet that'll be really fun just because this is my job and I I always tell them like dude it's not when you watch me play cash game poker it's not super fun to watch because I I just I get called quite a bit more often than perhaps I should be called I I guess I just look like the typical person that is running too many Bluffs at the table so a lot of the times when I'm playing cash I can just sit on my leather ass all day and chill there and actually get paid off on my big hands it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be that elaborate and that's really different than poker tournaments where obviously you have to really pick up the pace when the blinds and Annie's are being raised quite a bit so when when you do play tournaments a lot of the times if nobody's three betting you and you could get that big blind player to call you and that big blind player is just going to call you with half the deck and hit lots of really crappy Pairs and pay you off way too much you really want to think about opening hands that you would normally never open in a cash game similarly if someone is just opening way too many hands in a tournament and it's just calling every single time when you three bet them and they just have tons of garbage hands out of position in those big pots you really want to be attacking now that's going to make you a very active player in tournaments but that doesn't matter as much because the tables are breaking so fast your the blind levels are moving up so often people are busting so often that everybody's got to get moving at some point so if you're attacking it's not going to affect you nearly as much now a lot of cash game poker uh in my experience is convincing people that you're bluffing way more often than you actually are and actually taking advantage of the fact that the blinds and Annie's don't go up that often I mean don't go up at all unless you decide to go to another table you know what I meant anyway continuing you have time in cash games there's less money in the middle of every pot so there's less incentive to steal with weekends in this environment you can play more solid hands in position to make more money you have time to wait for big pots and positions so I do this experiment you should always do experiments when you're playing because the great thing about experiments is they're allowed to fail so don't be afraid to try and experiment every once in a while when you're playing just to see what happens so sometimes when I'm on a bad run in early position in cash games I'll just start opening eights plus Ace queen off suit which is way too tight for the long term but I'll do that whenever I'm feeling like I'm getting out of line a little bit from early position I've just gotten in the habit of opening too much and it's embarrassing how often that works just opening tighter so it obviously you expand it beyond that once you get a little bit more comfortable uh playing a little bit tighter again and not just going for it every single time you have uh a ten seven suited and whatever you were opening too much was just causing you so many problems but yeah you in cash games you can definitely be more solid because you do have the time now in tournaments there's a lot of times the other thing about tournaments is let's say you're a little reckless at the beginning just to touch Reckless that's not necessarily a bad thing because let's say you build your stack it's in a lot of tournaments nobody can reload in any fashion so deeper in the tournament when you have 70 big lines and everybody else has 30 or 40 big blinds well every one of your check raises every one of your double barrels every one of your free bets is going to risk all of their chips and very much make many of these people fold whereas if you go from 70 big lines to 58 big blinds that that sucks but it's not going to meaningfully change your chances of winning the tournament in a substantial away as for them going from 30 big lines to 18 or whatever it is right because they lose so much more ability to maneuver ability to do anything when they go from a short stack to a shorter stack if they lose the ability to three bet they lose the ability to even open sometimes if they just have to shove or fold that can be detrimental to playing the tournament in the fashion that you want to play so being a little bit reckless in tournaments I'm not convinced is the worst idea in the world because it does get you in those it does get you in those stack size Dynamics where you can really take advantage of people whereas in cash games okay sometimes there's value in advertising you're a little bit Wilder but everybody can just reload so it's not like you're going to have a stack size disparity that you can take advantage of start tight then adjust in tournaments you have to start attacking quickly that that's something at the beginning of tournaments you're going to get a lot of players that are there casually there this is a big day for them they're recreational and there's just going to be limp calling quite a bit so you really want to make sure you're paying attention and getting involved in pots with them in tournaments you have to start attacking quickly blinds into Annie's escalate and you never get a great great read on your opponents because a lot of the times they're at a new table or they Boss by the time you start getting a read you don't get many hands with them and cash game poker though you might play with some of your opponents every single day you have time to develop nuanced reads versus them start tight then adjust while you're Gathering Intel don't give off information yourself people have a hard time shaking First Impressions if you play tighter poker when you first get into the game people will label you as a knit you can exploit that image later if you're playing on a site that allows statistic tracking then this is another Edge you can exploit play solid poker and collect information on your opponents when you're not playing pull up the statistics you gathered on your opponents and start drawing up a Playbook to beat them this is uh when I was really in love with poker and just playing like 60 80 hours a week just massively multi-tabling and just grinding so many hours this is what I really live for was just trying to figure out okay these five people are at every single one of my tables how do I beat them and just drawing up game plans it really felt like getting to be a head coach in uh the NFL it really was fun just coming up with plans to try and beat these people like does this person fold a little too much on the river does this person check race too much from this position what could we actually use in each of these situations what does this person always triple barrel on a certain board just like pulling up the hands in the situations and really trying uh to go around it and you don't have to start as complicated as I just made it it can be as much as it can be as simple as just pulling up every similar situation you played with one player like okay what do they do in every single pot where they three about you what were those hands if anything got to show now what did they do on the Flop what did they do on the term what did they do on the river you you will be amazed what you discover in someone's game if you actually pay granular attention to them like that get comfortable being uncomfortable in tournament poker you are playing against gambling recreational players they are comfortable with allowing you to take the lead many of them will not take the initiative in a pot they will allow you to dictate terms this will help you this will help make your poker plane simple in cash games players are comfortable playing with larger Stacks they're willing to put you to the test more often you will need to do homework away from the table to get comfortable in these deep stack situations it can be a profitable play for example the three bet button openers from the blinds however this situation will also see you playing out of position frequently so you do want to make sure if you're using a poker Training Site doing all the quizzes you can you know taking a bunch of notes really drilling things you want to make sure you study before the exam where is uh tournament poker you would do after study quite a bit too but a lot of the times you can uh you're not going to be as deep stacked so you're not going to be playing really complicated turns and rivers as much so you do want to focus a little bit more on the shorter stack situations and tournaments I do find a lot of people have gaps in that that's something I struggle with myself I'm always Just a Touch Too type whenever I run the numbers then I should be but if you're going to play cash games you will be playing very difficult turns in rivers so you want to do as much work before you get to the table as possible on that get comfortable being uncomfortable study the game before you get to the table play lower Stakes than you normally would play play hard collect information from your sessions assess what you've learned and apply yourself again the next day once you are comfortable with situations that make other players uncomfortable you will have more Tools in your toolbox this will allow you to exploit the tables more effectively you can make good money raising with weekends when players to your left are not three betting or flattening enough your most frequent situation when you engage in this loose play is heads up pots with the big blind this is a great situation because your opponent is playing a raised part out of position with a capped range it's hard to win when you're in that disadvantageous of a situation however when you engage in this strategy you will sometimes run into players who three better cold call you when they're in position this makes your life difficult when you started with a weak hand if you can drill this situation and neutralize your positional disadvantage you will have a good reason to open up your game at softer tables if you don't practice out of position deep stack scenarios then you will be forced to play the majority of your larger pots from the button and cut off this will work at lower Stakes but it will become an impediment moving up so we covered a lot there so in tournaments a lot of people just aren't going to play back at you as much as they should because there's more recreational players assuming you're game selecting with any degree with any degree of proficiency if you're game selecting at all people just there's a lot of things people should be doing in tournament poker they're just not doing in tournament poker or if you're playing lower sticks there's just a lot of people playing for fun so you can set up that really nice situation again and again where you're opening and getting the big blind to call you in tournaments and that is just an excellent situation to set up because your opponent is playing way too many hands out of position in a raised pot and more of your continuation bets are going to work because they're going to miss so often and when they do hit they MIT they do hit very Jagged pairs so you can get a lot of value from them if you flopped a pretty decent second pair or top here now that's a situation you can exploit as well in cash games but cash game players have more tools they have deeper Stacks in which to apply pressure on you also they have more time to observe you just because you end up playing longer sessions with the same people so you do want to be careful as you add that play to your repertoire in cash games so you want to make sure okay these are truly recreational players they're not paying attention to me okay now I'll open a little bit more if you think the players to your left actually are playing Pretty seriously and there are people that take any buy-in cash games seriously you always have time in cash games to revert back to just solid poker whereas sometimes uh due to ornaments just the blind levels going up so often you will have to make a move at some point table selection will make or break you ninety percent of your job in poker is table selection it doesn't matter if you're the 10th best player in the world if you're sitting at a table with the nine best players in the world then you're going to lose conversely if you constantly surround yourself with weaker players who are not as assertive then you are far more likely to win it is unlikely you'll ever find a table completely without solid players you will have to get comfortable being uncomfortable in pots with them but once you are outside of pots with them you will have to work to clean out a recreational player's money as quickly as possible collect information on the players you're playing against if there is an obvious whale then you should seek to be at every single table they play and you should try to get into as many pots as possible with them if there are obvious killers at your level then seek to avoid their tables if at all possible which is going to be difficult but if the one thing you can do is try to get position on them try to make pots with them as small as possible try to generally stay out of their way it work like that when you're playing tournaments if you're playing a low enough buy-in tournament or if you're playing on a big enough site that attracts a number of recreational players if there's enough players in the field you're it's going to be soft enough if there's 500 runners in a 50 tournament you're fine there's just going to be a lot of people going ah 50 bucks it's a Friday night let's have fun or it's Sunday I'm having a good time let's go ahead and play right so that is table selection is more or less built in if you're playing low to mid Stakes tournaments now obviously As you move up and stakes in tournaments you're going to have to really pay attention to okay who's buying into this what was the promotion like for this tournament were there a number of satellite winners Etc or is this just all killers now when you're playing cash games you can completely change how much money you make in a session based on your table selection it's uh it's amazing to me when you play Live how few how many people just won't move from a table they know is bad and I don't know if it's just a loss of face they just don't want to admit I don't want to play with these players but uh if you can locate loose passive tables in cash games that that is 90 of your job and the way you'll identify it is just with the classic signs people limping quite a bit people limb calling quite a bit uh people calling out of position quite often people calling down often with really weak hands people raising with really goofy hands and constantly calling three bats out of position that kind of stuff will really set you up for good situations these players can turn hands into Bluffs this is one of the biggest differences you will see between the two formats this is a major point that tournament Players Miss constantly when they move to cash tournament Players are used to playing shorter Stacks when you're playing with shorter Stacks you can go to the felt with a variety of your top Pairs and even second pairs defending yourself with your best pairs on a short stack is not a bad strategy because tournament Players get used to this they generally don't fold their decent pairs when they're playing with larger Stacks they don't want to fold them but they don't want to rip their chips in with them either they end up calling down with most of their Pairs and allowing their opponents to dictate terms since your opponent are in I mean this is just something uh this is a general thing that should be discussed you will see a lot of guys in who are used to tournament poker are used to 30 40 big lines maybe they play Mega hide at the beginning and then it gets to 30 to 40 big blind poker or they're just massively multi-tabling and they start really paying attention when they're deep and it's like 50 big lines or something like that a lot of times when those players are playing cash they they do tend to call down quite a bit with top Pairs and second Pairs and maybe one of the there's a lot of times you have a second pair that you should just turn into a bluff but you won't see that happen as often as it should be done if you're just used to calling down with your 27x stack in your weak pair in whatever it is so anyway since your opponents are not used to playing deep Stacks in a creative manner you can value that thinly in many tournaments your opponents will see their decision as binary do I call or fold here so there's uh one of the most this is something I see I I've taught a lot of different students in private lessons this is something I see with tournament Players quite often which is they just don't consider turning their hands into Bluffs nearly as much just because that situation doesn't come up as much when they're playing because they're playing with shorter Stacks a lot of the time and you're just not going to get into as many elaborate turn or river situations so the way you get practice for that in cash games there's a lot of times you you check River and the guy fires and you know he would have double barrel to flush her or something just from playing with him earlier and now he's betting when the flush Rock came in and it's okay whatever you know this is a loose hypothetical but maybe now I should turn my second pair into a bluff or whatever it is that situation doesn't come up as much in tournaments if you guys are just all in on the turn or whatever it is right or if you just re-raised if the stacks are just shorter and you just didn't even get to a more elaborate River to begin with or if your shove isn't going to be that many chips so you're not even sure if this Bluff is really going to work so for that reason you'll see a lot of people your opponent's not being used to playing deep Stacks in a creative manner they in tournaments you will be able to Value bet really thinly in many tournaments I'm always amazed at how thinly I can value that in a lot of tournaments and you I get dinged on that a lot when I play cash games this happens to me all the time when I've been playing a bunch of tournaments and then I come back to cash games and I go for a really thin riverbat and it's just the second the chips leave my hands like what am I doing and sure enough uh I'm I'm I get raised quite often there and then you're really you're really stuck there because if the guy is Raising as much as he should he puts you in a terrific position but in a terrific situation for him I mean but if you know that most people don't Bluff enough in that situation it's tough because now you got to be siding towards a fold so you you get into this war with yourself that is really uh tough to deal with now tasking players do not think in a binary fashion like I have to call or fold with my mediocre pairs this is not how cash game players think they are more used to playing with deep Stacks if they see you betting small on a coordinated and connected board they're going to ask themselves some fundamental questions wouldn't my opponent have bet larger with their best hands when they want to protect their hand while simultaneously getting value from it if they correctly put you on a thin value bat with a decent pair they might just try they might try to just rip their chips in and see what happens they know their crappier pairs can't beat the decent pairs you value betting but they also know you're more you're unlikely to call large Rays with your mediocre pair due to this Dynamic you have to be careful with what you've thinly valued at in cash games you need to consider checking back and trapping more in cash games especially versus more creative and aggressive opponents alright guys that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this one I'll see you for the next one of these take care good luck to you if you're playing today", metadata={'source': 'o0QJbvWMEqs', 'title': 'Moving From TOURNAMENT Poker To CASH GAMES!', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 8935, 'thumbnail_url':

[Document(page_content="my name is Michael ASO I'm the author of more poker Theory and we will be getting started now so um we have six hands that I would like to go over uh today's topic is playing out of position as the pr aggressor in single race spots with a short stack um idea the idea with this webinar series is to be uh building knowledge um in basically creating some sort of building blocks right so uh first we're going over short stacks we first covered playing against the big Lane and in and out of position now we're playing you know um out of position as a pre aggressor uh then we will be looking at some interesting final table or ICM situations pref flop with a short stack as well and then we will be uh ready to move into maybe deeper Stacks or maybe some blind on blind play uh we will see okay for this hand the hero has 18 big blings and he's opening a offsuit from the hijack uh as again as always he um always good to have in mind what are the ranges in play so here we have racing first from I said the hijack so racing ring first from the hijack and we choose the 20 b bles stack so this is the range or I assigned to the here in this situation um yeah here races and botton calls out of a 40 stack now this is an interesting situation because looking at the um Monker simulation here if the hij races and it get the action gets to the bottom uh the bottom will only have an all in range right uh but in this situation the hijack the botton is um a lot deeper with the guys on the blinds and so I wouldn't expect him to just Jam very vience effective here but the calling range uh should not be that much different a lot of the hands that can be jammed can be Tri um as well um so uh this is what we have here uh the calling range for uh the bottom will be effec L to the CL range to put 20 V blings uh the exact range is is not as important what is important is the um the shape of the range right that it has the same type of uh you know small pairs suited connectors suited Broadway suited AES type of hands and plus the uh the traps uh at this stack dep you should be comfortable uh trapping with a and Kings here um maybe not Queens so much I I wouldn't expect that but definitely um Kings and NES are very good hands to call here that way you're also protected again and against squee against the squeezes from the lines so um botton calls and the players fault and we get this flop Bing Jack let's first play the hand out and then go to the GTO simulation so uh it goes continuation beted for one3 of the B small bed size um bot on calls turnning 10 of heart uh making a one card straight on the board action goes check check and then the river is do sus spes and the hero goes all in for little bit of over a b here now uh he he got a fault and so let's look at the solution now so uh first thing that is important to look at is the equities and well uh based on r on the ranges in play you you should be asking yourself who has the equity Advantage here uh what player will have more equity in this board now that um again the the main difference when playing out of position at the pref aggressor here against an imposition player is that um the imposition player range will be very very tight so this is uh something like 9% hands total for imposition well if we were playing against the big line right this stack dep the big blind um will be defending versus the hijack um 62% hands right so this is a extremely wide range compared to to what the um the bottom is flatting and that will of course make a huge difference now um when you're playing against the big Blane and the range is so wide that there will be a lot of M hands that right that never flop anything in a lot of boards and that allows um the preflow aggressor to continue Barling or Bing the Flop very aggressively at a very high frequency but in this situation uh the rols cannot reversed and if we look here now um the the hero who the pr aggressor has a range of 26% hands against 8% hands here 9% hands and and that will of course um mean that you know the equities change and the ranges hit the board the flops differently so if we look at the equities here um they they run pretty close so it's 51% against um 49% equities run really really close and because of that we see uh well I didn't include a bigger bet size here but the wouldn't use it either um too too frequently when you see Equity R dis close those most um mostly bed size similar mostly small bed size will be used and there will also be a lot of checking from out position right um with our specific combo A10 Spades and clubs a Spates and um 10 clubs here uh this hand can be checked with have you know um 50/50 Bing on checking frequency and here we can compare uh betting against checking using this Arrow it will give us the E difference so the hands that um are in green color are hands that benefit a lot more from checking and there are no hands uh that maybe these Queen 10 combos here uh that are slightly better betting than checking but this is such a small difference in Nash distance that um that uh it's pretty much different it wouldn't really make a difference and the good thing about this is once you compare the strategies this way uh you see uh which will be a bigger mistake here uh to bet the wrong hand or to uh to check the wrong hand now since there are no hands that are you know losing a lot of EV by checking uh the biggest mistake will take one of these hands that are in green that benefit a lot from from checking and bed right so for example here beding 97 uh Spates will be a huge mistake and you will be losing about two chips right out of the 34 chips in the pot actually um what I did about was to just trick here I like to uh remove a bunch of zeros right from uh the stacks and and the pot to make the calculations easier so here this shows the pot for 34 chips but it was in fact 34,000 right uh just that that in mind so um going back to the Flop uh yeah so here we can see that betting uh a hand that wants to check would be bigger mistake and so you will be fine if you just check your entire range here you will not be losing uh any at all because there are not really any hands that um um will be losing a lot of EV by checking here that's a very important very important thing so uh ideally I'll probably playing this situation as I checking my entire range um the hero played the hero to B and this hand this combo can be played as a 50/50 so it's not a big deal then uh in position will not really be uh Rising much at all and only folding very small frequency here uh just some really bad um bad cards that's why um B um it it doesn't really accomplish that much most of the hands that um IP is folding are just very low Equity hands all right so uh the action goes B call and the turn is the 10 of Hearts now uh really interesting interestingly enough after um you chose to bet the Flop and got the call now um looking at the equities now let's we can look at actually the um uh the hotness uh hit map here and see how different cards Tor cards will improve uh hero Equity so hero is out of position so we look at the equity here and some really bad turns will be a king for example a jack um most of the low cards will be neutral bringing about keeping around 50/50 equity and then some of the um sevens eights nines 10 and will be um particularly better for for the hero um given the way the ranges are are compromised so uh with the 10 of Hearts um Hero's equity orquid actually improves and what happens is that let's look at the position strategy so uh here basic effectively um in the 10 of Hearts Let's actually can look at here it's better uh there's there's a lot of betting for the small bet size the bigger bet size um is mostly only used in medium cards looks like yeah um so here on the 10 in general unless the 10 of clubes you won't see really much bigger bed size the of clubs difference is that it brings a second flusher of course and then now you actually want to just Jam uh a lot of hands here but um with the 10 of Hearts there's no need you can just bet small and keep betting your range uh you wouldn't be raised that much the St to p ratio is very very shallow so even if the building has a queen here he shouldn't be yamming all that often to us almost like never at all and if he does then yeah you you have to fold some of your two PA type hands but we should have the hero should have here so many Straits right and top two pair and sets that it doesn't matter even if he jams we still have a pretty Prett strong range that can call almost 60% of the time here and with this to put ratio it will be a rather easy call with um ajck you know fold King Jack you f some more often than that and then a then uh you can probably call like um 50/50 or something like that all right so um by betting small what we mostly accomplished is um just um f get value um from a lot of a ax and also F some um and get Val from flos and set up a river yam that's effectively what we want to do in this C because it's very for a range we have um an advantage here when just want to keep putting money into the pot and force the in position player to keep putting money with you know um two pairs and stuff like that if we look at the range Explorer here um on this turn straights the out of position player will have 27 combos which is 1/3 of his range while um the in position player will only have a straight um 15 Combos and that's 23% of of um his range with this difference um it of course makes sense that now um the out position player wants to keep uh start building a keep building the pot and just viral for three streets a very high frequency and also because of of how often uh the her has a straight here compared to the villain we uh that's why we don't see much racing by the imposition player even if he has a queen he shouldn't be racing at all um because then if he raises every single queen he has a queen on the river and we can just you know keep yamming on him very very aggressively uh some of our hands also benefit by by getting protection and getting value from FL and other stuff and you know a PA and a straight Dr that will be calling a turn bed so yeah um which which is uh let's see how big of a mistake is here so it goes here and with the A10 is different so e wise uh we wouldn't be losing much e uh but I think um we can probably just get away with betting um more more often than um than equilib suggest mostly because we're just not getting raised at all here okay uh you goes check check and relase the do of Spates now now um jamming here is is definitely a big mistake um as plate on the do of Spades um now yeah there are some hands that want to go in but those hands are straights and then some Bluffs right so uh and some uh maybe a few uh strong two pairs uh that were played this way but um yeah for the most part we're just um Bluff or valuating right uh but um not not really using hands like two pairs or you know A10 for that A10 definitely prefers a um a small bet size a lot more so let's compare B going all in and B small here and see with A1 we are losing um 3.4 chips um so this is a relatively large um mistake given the size of the pot so this would be like 10% of the starting pot which is a lot um it's a very very uh big mistake um the hands that definitely I want to go in here are just the straight Combos and then the Bluffs definitely so yeah uh well we shove and good default now into the next one so here we have pocket kings the hero is on under again 900 table and he goes for the race now the hero range from under the G with 17 big BLS it's going to be something like this um just a a very tight range about 15% hands mostly focusing on high cards uh suited uh the weaker weakest PA that the solver opens here pocket sixes with a very small frequency against weaker players you can probably open them with 100% frequency but uh for the most part you want to um if you're a a tough table you want to probably go with S Plus A10 um ace5 sued plus so yeah it's is just very strong range uh that will connect a top pair very frequently which is key when you are short stock you want to be hitting a lot of top pairs or middle pairs not be hitting D that's why you don't see a lot of racing with you know um Su connector type of hands or even the weaker baby ax although um the sare doesn't open these hands I think in practice you can probably open them every time because um even uh in the toughest online play online Fields players won't Treet you often enough to make these hands really lose much eeve and I don't think I've seen any of my students database these hands ever losing when open from every position so I probably still open them but yep so uh here opens and and +1 flat calls here and now about the um +1 calling range so let's see D+ one defend at 17 yeah um the solver has a very very uh small fllying range here about uh 3% hands um which is um yeah many some players might not might not really have a flatting r here a lot of players would probably just play ream or or fault uh it's really tough to range this situation because it doesn't really happen all the all that much um since the underground player has more chips also he he could just play uh a lot of a very linear range like Ace Queen plus you know Aja plus and maybe nines or eights plus eight plus probably and uh you know king queen suited King Jack Queen Jack and three make a small Tri and be willing to call off the hero um here uh so the flat call is not that usual but um it can happen now given the let's bring the simulation here yeah so I I run up the range because um this is just little to me not probably not enough hand so I what I did was to round it a little bit um so that um it makes more sense to what some players might be calling here like trapping always Aces some Kings uh sometimes just flatting with Ace Queen Ace Jack suited right um which is what I think um most people would probably play um King jaak is uh and king queen are probably just too good that uh they shouldn't be flatted um and they also well some people might flat might flat this type of hands as well um I think um you will just make sense to get this in in this range F flop but um it won't it won't really make a huge difference in the in the end result now um okay the action Falls around and the Flop comes 1097 rainbow so again um you have to start thinking what player will have the the range the equ advantage in this board given the ranges in play this range for IP is just so small such a small range and actually connects quite well um in this type of board uh with is a structure of 1079 so um let's look at the simulation and in this simulation actually um the hero got it right he checked the Flop and this is the correct play now there is a very small frequency here of just jamming alling with a few hands which I will ignore um I will assume that we just play check checking strategy here if we look at at the equity uh in this flop actually the H has a a massive Equity disadvantage we have 45% Equity against 55% from IP IP will have uh all the sets here nine sevens and uh 10 um he will also have a lot of like top pair and and traps with Aces and Kings so it's a pretty pretty strong range in this this in this flop that's why the hero checks um and facing the small bit I didn't use the exact same bed size um when I build my simulations I just like to put like you know um a a standard is bit uh big and small bet sizes because mostly what you want to see in the simulations is not how to play against the exact bet size that your opponent use but you want to do but what you want to do is to draw conclusions right you want to create tics okay if I check in this sort of situation I put bet small what do I do oh should my Pon bet big or bet small right if I only input the exact bet size the vill and use um I will not get that information from the simulation right so what we're trying to do here is not just see how to play a single hand but to understand the spot and see if we can uh draw conclusions that can be used in different situations that are similar to this one because that's what poet is all about to uh be constantly uh you know facing different situations analyzing them and trying to generate juristic or create sort of rules that can be extended to different similar situ similar situations okay uh so here um the villan got it right he should be wearing um smallish in the 25% or 3% of the PO bet size and with the pocket kings we can um uh with the black kings um check race um or check call sometimes um it's not a big deal we you should be Check Racing here with some frequency with something like you know an open Ender with ace8 king8 um some of the you know the the over sorry the overcard the over pairs with a straight draw are really good uh pocket n sets then slow playing the top Set uh is a really good um combo to have when you just check all the Flop and then check all uh a bunch of over cards and high cards right um as play CH hero check calls and the turn is the Queen of Diamonds I'm actually going to finish uh first replaying the hand and then go back to the simulation so Queen of Diamonds in the turn hero checks villan goes all in for 116k chips left so a little bit overp and the hero um FS H even before looking at the simulation I knew that this is a massive mistake um you just you just can't um make a lot of money playing pocket if you're folding over pairs uh with this uh shallow very shallow Stacks um when yeah there are some possible Straits but the biggest you know the more likel trade here will be king Jack which I'm not even sure if the building has any range but if he had it we block that straight that's what I didn't B including that many King Jack combinations here um also put King Jack the B might justbe checking back the Flop once we um once we check when we check the Flop uh the villain should be betting uh the small bet size very aggressively and only checking back a few combos but I would expect the V to just bet his range here probably right okay so um on the Queen of Diamonds um the hero checks again and now um yeah thean will go in with some hands that need protection he will of course have Aces sometimes but he will also have some draws like Ace Jack he will also have some stuff like king queen Ace Jack are mostly hands that really want to go in here uh maybe Queen 10 as well so we are with pocket kings is still ahead of the range and yeah so the OB n folding here if we look at the EV difference we are losing five chips uh from the pot the starting pot was uh 69 chips so that's uh again like maybe uh 8% of the pot something like that is just a huge uh loss this um this is just a massive mistake um I wouldn't recommend doing it uh when you shouldn't be folding a hand when you're uh beat some of your opponent's value range right if your opponent is going here with a queen sometimes right with a queen or if he has that um yeah if he's going holding sometimes with a queen or whatever um um or you know um king queen or whatever you should you should not be folding hand that is ahead of some of your opponent's value range d for the pocket kings uh I wouldn't recommend that um because again your hands just so um so good like okay let's bring the Monker so simulation for 17 B BLS um yeah yeah the hand is just so good that if you're jamming it from early position you're just leaving a lot of money on the table and again if you play a pusher fault only um you will be shrinking the number of hands you can play uh profitably now you see I gave the solver the option of going all in or mean race here and it only it ches mean racing exclusively never uses the alling option because alling here will be my a lot lower EV um you're just taking down the blind pre flop and with pocket kings is a hand that will be so good post flop that uh you don't want to be doing that if we use a pusher F calculator and we give all of the players 17 big bles right make it uh like Pusher fault it's going to take a few seconds here to finish running the [Music] calculations yeah the pre FL me race is is a good play of course that's what I think much better than jamming okay so if UT goes all in here he can only play profitably this range about 12% hands right well if we mean race uh he can play profitably a much much wider range of almost 15% hands uh that is a very good increase so we can play all of these King n suited type of hands some King Jacks different King eight all of the suited ax right um and then post flop a range that is this strong is going to connect um the flops much much better than um uh that and that then the big for example who will be calling and then uh we can get for example with pocket kings Aces or Ace King whatever all of these hands will connect post flop so well that then we can win a lot of chips post flop from the from the blinds we can also get ream by weaker ranges than the range that will be calling off the jam and and so um that's how we maximize our EV now in if you are in a bubble situation a final table or or some you know some very heavy ICM situation where um there's a lot of money at stake um yeah you can reduce your Bing by just playing push or fault um but at the same time you the the idea here as poker players is to you know maximize our expected value and if you know you're afraid of playing post flop with a good hand as pocket kings because you might get unlucky uh then the answer is not to jam pocket kings so you don't get out Dr or outplay po flop the answer is to study more pocker become a better post FL player so you can make better decisions and then you'll be comfortable playing hands like this all of the time even get gets multiway or whatever and uh just knowing very well how to play um the spots po flop so you can maximize your earnings right that's uh the idea of playing pocket is that in the long run you want to maximize your earnings now there will of course be exceptions as I just mentioned like in a final table or heavy I situation like money bubble or if there was a bounty uh in a tournament in your head or one our players that there will be some different things that might um make you want to take a different uh action than mean racing but in a regular spot I think just uh meain racing is going to be by far the best play next hand we have uh n Spades lowjack from the lowjack with 20 LS uh opening about 22% hands now including a few of these offs Broadways in the opening range and Action Falls to the cut of calls and we go to the Flop a 108 the cut off against the lowjack should be calling uh very n range again about 8% hands um but here we have a bunch of you know suit ax again the traps with the ases and the Kings which is now a very common theme here again because the cut off is all in sorry is deeper stack against all players here I wouldn't expect him to just randomly B in here but he can probably just take a lot of these hands and D them with int intention to just call off the hero right uh that actually um works really well he can make it something like six big blings here and seven big blings and he will be um just committing himself the call of the hero he'll be as if he went all in but he's not committing his attack against these two players here right even against the big he will just be forced to call if he makes um a TI like that with these hands but these hands will just have great Equity like if you king queen s King Jack SED and one of these guys gets in you know pocket 10 during great shape so um shouldn't be a big problem okay so uh the hero goes for the check on the Flop oh first of all again um start before thinking about the decision if you should be betting or checking the Flop and start to think um how the players ranges that we just saw interact with this board you know what player would have the equity advantage and what player would have the range Advantage like what player would have more sets sets a set of 10 set of eights right what player will have more two PA combinations a 10 A8 108 for example right if there's a um a FL Str but range tends to be more suited for example the calling ranges in position tend to be more suited than the opening range the opening range tends to be T to also have a bunch of upsuit Broadways offsuit ax right the imposition play will always have like more Su type of hands and also think about the con AC ity if there are possible Straits what r What range has more of the possible Straits of these things will help you um start to predict if you should be betting a lot or checking a lot in the in different FL flop textures but again when you're out of position you should be a lot less inclined to put a lot of bets into the pot because of the position disadvantage you want to be playing more passively when you're out of position in general compared to when you are in position right now let's bring the uh before the GTO simulation let's play out the hand so hereo checks uh C of bets small about one3 he do check races um cut of calls uh there's a six of space on a turn and hero jams and he gets the call by Ace five spades diamonds so um now we want to check out the simulation and see um if here play this hand correctly or if we can improve on it um again start off by looking at the equities so equities run pretty close and given the equities run pretty close again we will see a lot of checking from out of position uh but here interestingly enough if we bet um the hero wants to bet the bigger bet size than uh this smaller one let me see um go back to the Flop now yeah um here the main reason why we are betting this big is because um there are a lot of draws here this uh the beted size is also influenced by uh how much protection do your um strongest hands required right if this was if the Flop was um with a different structure then your um stronger hands will not require as much protection and there's also um a lot of good hands that the impul player can have here to call here the bet now let's look at the uh strong the range polarization and see who has stronger range on the Flop so starting with the out position player he has uh sets about nine comos 3.7% of his range and IP also has um has a little bit less he only has um um Aces and okay yeah he only has Aces but um and yeah so IP only has Aces and out position has nine combinations he has hes 10 and eights so this is a big uh very big incentive for the out position player to use a bigger bet size because he has a lot more noted noted hands than the in position player has and he can get a lot of value from those so betting with a set here um um he he has the sets as protection he can B with with those with some frequency but the hands that really benefit from the um bigger bed size actually hands like top pairs that uh benefit from getting FS or from yeah basically from what we're looking for here is protection betting and the stronger hand like the sets will be more inclined to uh to just check because they don't really need as much protection right they if the opponent has something like a queen 10 if you have a set you're not really going to lose on the turn if your opponent makes two pair you actually want your opponent to make two pairs uh so that uh you can extract more value in later streets so betting with um with a set here will not be terrible if we look at the e but um um just losing little bit less than a chip if we use a bigger beted size we lose again less than one um chip with the sets uh of St for example AC is going to be affected a lot because with Aces the difference is that you block the top pairs that will continue against you um but yeah okay so um then we look at two pairs op will have uh 16 combinations while IP only has nine combinations so already the strongest possible hands that are in the range um two pairs and sets are more frequently in the out position player range so even if the overall Equity um Advent equities run pretty close right then the polarization will go to the out position player who will now benefit from using the bigger beted sizes even if he's not betting the aces he still has like a buch of aceing Queen that um are really really strong in this type of board and of course all of the two pairs also benefit a lot from you know putting money into the PO right now uh it's also useful to look at the combo draws and top type of hands top Ty of hands for I for op total of uh 66 combinations about 27% of the range op has 21% of the range 18 combinations only and looking at the combo RW we have um five combos for op and only 1.18 combos for eight combos for IP then um this is the the main driving Factor here for the bigger beted size and the fact that also IP will have a bunch of hands that connect very well with this board and giv when you have a polarization Advantage uh and your opponent has hands that can call bigger bets you should go for bigger bets that's another thing that people misses all the time right so you have a strong range you have all the sets you have all the two pairs here which are the strong the strongest possible hands and your opponent also has a bunch of uh strong hands like topers himself and gut shots and flos that will be calling big bets so why you should you be betting in small particularly if you're out of position you want to um decrease your POS positional disadvantage and hopefully just get to jam the turn a lot of the time right when everything breaks so so that's what we are looking for here um the hero played the hand differently he went for the check looking at our individual combos here with Queen n of Spades this hand likes a lot more continuation Bing you can just bet the bigger bed size and then when called on the six of Spades you just go in here with um with this combo and a lot of you know back to flure stuff like that so it works really well you bet big and then you jam but as play um it's also fine it's not a big mistake or anything it just uh looking at the queen n here comparing e of checking and Bing Big losing about you know um 20% of one chip so is it's not a big deal uh I can go um check and then when check the solver likes to go for the check Race So checking and if they a position play will bet here again bigger or small bet size small bet size and then you could just check race as plate let's make the squares proportional let's not make them proportional to the weight so we see if we had we would we shouldn't have we sped here all that often because we should be betting it for a bigger bet size in the Flop but if we had it we will be Check Racing um IP will call six of Spades and then we just go in with this hand so it's not a huge mistake or anything um I think is a good play I like it um but maybe hero was thinking about betting a small here and you know having an awkward situation on the turn but if you bet big you can just Jam the turn very frequently we have King Queen of Spades uh early position with 20 V blings again with 20 b blings opening about 16% hands we already seeing this range Action Falls to the bottom calls goes heads out and we have this flop Queen 52 again let's start thinking about oh the C let's look at the Cod of calling range here in this situation with 20 P bles so now the cut off will be um calling about 8% hands so trapping Aces and canes again very common theme here you should be getting used to this and you know suited some of the middle suited ax the stronger ones will be triet cold or ream if he's also shallow a bunch of some of the S connectors small pocket pairs the range makes a lot of sense and so we look at this this flop Queen 52 let's start by uh looking at the strongest hands here are of course top set which uh Hero has and IP should have with some frequency here slow playing Queens so he has that then middle set pocket fives let's bring another chart here so we can compare so uh the hero is not opening pocket Vibes so he doesn't have that and pocket doces no player has pocked doces so right from the start we can see how um the cut off on this flop will have a very strong range with set of five set of set of Queens which the hero does not have the set of fives and then Aces and Kings will be in both player ranges so um this this uh this this the these are the most important pieces of information that we should be looking look at here and also that um the range for uh the C is much tighter so he has only 8% of all toal possible hands while uh the hero has here 15 16% hands so he has two twice as much hands as many hands as the cut of has here and there's a lot of overlapping in the range so the ranges are very similar in the shape there's a lot of overlapping and um there's also this portion here of mid M string hands like you know sixes sevens eights nines tens Jacks right that our middle pair that the hero has that the cut off doesn't have um so just with that information now we we we kind of get a sense that you know the cut off will actually be more polarized have the polarization Advantage well the hero hill we have a a range that actually needs protection and um he would probably benefit from R playing passively so let's look at the the GT solution here and yeah um now the the Cod of the the hero will be checking his range right all of the hands uh just for the reasons that we mention we're loing we're missing some of the sets here with the FES and then there is a bunch of middling ex strem hands in the range that just benefit so much from protection and then the imposition player is a lot more polarized and he has as overall the polarization event as super at the equities there is a small Equity disadvantage for our our position but the main thing here is uh the polarization right so um and there are not really any throws that would really change the uh the board too dynamically in future streets so um here will benefit a lot from by just playing passively here right uh in this situation the hero goes for a very large bet he's betting like two3 of the pot here which if we compare um it's B even more than that actually yeah it's Bing much bigger than that I gave uh yeah I gave 2550 it's been like two3 of the PO so if we compare the Eevee here of betting big or checking uh there are a lot of hands that definitely benefit a lot from checking and we input even a bigger bigger bet size will of course not being used not be used if the 69 chips is not used the 80 chips will definitely not be used so um uh the this bed size definitely um means that the hero is completely missing um the the situation you know the way the rang just interact with the board and again this is something that you should be thinking out at the very start of the hand you know who has a stronger range who connects the stronger hands possible here who has the strongest R Who benefits from checking who benefits from betting uh what B size makes sense given these constraints right um so the hero he totally missed and you know he's he's of checking his range he's actually going for a very large bed size which is uh not what um you would like to do here uh this big beted size is definitely wrong uh should be checking uh when you don't have the range advantage against your opponent uh in situations like this very frequently so as play um well uh the did call once and then the PO is 298 chips and we have a stacks of 316 and the hero sha again um this is just a massive mistake um we're not reading in the situation correctly and what we are doing here is just letting our opponent play like perfect poker um calling as when he has a stronger hand than ours more of not um not really calling that often when he has quicker hand and we are just missing on a lot of value um for example if we bet small here twice we still get called by weaker hands uh for example actually we just check we allow him to start bluffing so he start bling his Jack highs for example 10 highs nine highs you know stuff like that Jackson T he never has um but he will have nines and uh eights that will start betting now just PR for protection but we just uh getting value from a lot of different weaker hands here if we check this board if we choose to go for big big bets now uh we are isolating ourselves against the stronger portion of the villain range and we're not really getting value from this and then if he calls and turns the five of diamonds and we jam now we are probably not getting C by by the any of this ever right and so that will of course we get C when he has ace5 or you know a Kings or queens or Ace Queen has crushed and yeah so this another example of being um over excited when you have a strong hand and not wanting your opponent to get lucky against you or outd drawn you uh if you look at this right um here let's look at the hotness on the river so um yeah there are not many um we we are we we are a very uh big Equity disadvantage sure there are not really any many River cars that are so good for H for our range so we just want to keep the poort small um there is not really any reason for us to to to be doing this to be um going this big uh this just means that again you have a strong hand and you are not allowing yourself to get extra EV Extra Value from your good hands and then when you have a good hand what are you doing here just betting a small or giving up that strategy will be very face up and very easy to counter by any um you know opponent who is spaying attention so um I'll avoid doing this so don't bet big when your opponent can have a lot of strong hands you should either bet small or be checking and then when you have a strong hand and about and St ratio of one I know there is a lot of there are a lot of old eristics that suggest you just gooll you have a pot siiz bed but that's not true you know you can still bet like quarter pot and and have some room Le left to maneuver and and future streets or even fold given you know um some specific situation so um don't Mis value when you have a good hand is tough to make a good hand in poker when you have one you should try to maximize value uh again of course there will be some situations in in tournaments where you want to maximize uh your eveve and some situations where you want to lower your variance if this is uh I don't know a bubble situation or something like that I might see uh you know the volume just end in the hand as possible as quickly as possible but uh other than that I don't see any reasons for for doing this okay let's check the next hand so we have a king six of space here on the hijack which is actually um bit too wide of an open I think from 1450 B B Stacks I think the bottom hand here will be king seven SED but um I actually included King six in the range uh because of the you know the sake of the simulation but also this open can make sense if these players here are weak and they will not be attacking the hero uh effectively enough so the hand falls to the her who opens for a small race almost me race flops Toop pair and checks goes against small B check check and there in the river he makes a small bat of one third of the pot and gets called by the villain with the queen Jack so again going back to sorry the Flop start thinking uh you know how well um The Players range just connect this board um the bottom sorry the ring is in play the let's go back to this sorry I forgot about that um the hijack range with um 15 big BLS will include some jams right so I will only be taking the portion of the range that does not have Jam as you can see here the bottom hand here is k seven but it's fine so the the at this stock dep the hero should be jamming a lot of you know this weak pocket pairs some of the stronger Broadways of tox and then me raise good intention of calling out of the stronger hands I mean race holding some of this right so um there is that and then the the button calling range versus the hijack at 15 big lines again um at this stack de the problem is that there there will be no calling range I don't think um not much so just very little hands uh for the most part you just want to be playing um a thet or F strategy uh people don't really call from 15 B bles all that much uh so I think I use for the simulation the 20 b blames or the 17 maybe that will be you know um will have will make a little more sense for hands that villance can call in this sort of situation from the bottom okay now into the simulation is this yeah this hand number five uh in this flop the hero wants to bet his entire range and mostly use a small bet size now why is that uh let's look at the equities uh Equity Advantage 54 against 45% oh 50 yeah 46 rounding and then um looking at the ranges okay so actually let's put them here probably it's probably better yeah so the king queen connects really really well with all of these hands right that are being mean raised uh while the villain here will be reaming or tting a lot of these um king and queen type of hands so his range will include yeah wicker queens and wicker King X and then a bunch of like um Pairs and S stuff and a a few a bunch of AIS and G shots so um let's go here I think I I clicked something here and change the the let's just open this again it won't affect the simulation but just for the sake of um having it right here with the right ranges so looking at the range Explorer and let's look at sets and out position has six combinations against 4.5 uh two pairs so a bunch more of two pair king queen uh type of combinations here then over pairs um both players have uh the same number of or pairs top pairs here IP only has eight combinations against 37 combinations and this is what makes the difference so so so many hands that could benefit from just um putting money here and of course the beted size is um small uh we have an advantage but it's not as massive um it's just that um we don't have that many like ult super strong hands that will benefit by just putting in a ton of money right away uh but we still have an advantage enough to make us want to bet our entire range and just uh capitalize in our F equity in the Flop going back to the Flop actually let's play out the hand so oh yeah I think already it goes check check yeah that's small okay um so hero definitely makes a mistake here um by checking his King six he's not realizing correctly that his range just uh connects so well here that he gets to R his entire range he has the the equ advantage has stopper Advantage he doesn't have a massive Advantage ultr strong hands but uh he can bet small and he can also choose to bet big with you know um a polarized range split his range but for the most part I'll probably just be using the more bet size here just B um one third of the pot with my entire range so he checks and faces a small bit of about um maybe 25% of the PO so against the check IP again since he's he has a very significant equip disadvantage he should not be betting all that often and that's also why H you want to bet yourself because if you check your opponent will be checking back a lot in this situation he chooses to bet putting a small beted here I made it three um this is my default beted size is here but it won't be a a huge difference here either making it four uh here will be check calling this combo oh yeah I can say that check calling the king six uh there will be some check races of course if we check but we should never do it so um this is kind of weird if we make this is proportional to um how often we should have this actually you see you can see that we just don't have any hands here but if we uh make things normalizing the um the squares it looks like uh you know give us the straty that we will play if we had the hands in the range so if we had King six let's remove this so we had it we just call and then turn blue check check and looks like yeah you we just call turnning the seven of clubs clubs and here checks and again now IP should be Bing at a very high frequency know now he has a set of sevens too he has a after we check called The Flop and we just have a um a bunch of uh kind of a cap range a lot of the stronger hands will be bet two3 of the PO in the simulation so uh now the GTO will be taking advantage of that and just buing high frequency but he chooses to check back which makes sense looking hands like Queen Jack of course we be checking back so he checks and the river is a blank four of Spades now we should be betting with our King six just uh putting in a value bet there again uh we can bet range probably for a um a small bed size if we remove the bigger bed size here at the is um the over the jam which is not being used all that often um that wouldn't be a huge deal here either uh you can just go small uh B most of your range here and you can clud a of your hands uh here your checking range is super weak just you know uh sixes and fives and you know few highs that probably just giving up um I think um as played when the villain checks back the turn he's capping himself a lot to use a bunch of Jack X sorry ace high and queen 10 Queen X um some weaker pairs so we can just bet for a small bet size here and uh print M this hand I probably just check fing giving up regardless um yeah so we're missing some value here with the king I think after vill checks back he we up just against um a queen way too often like yeah he could have um maybe uh a few traps here um but that is um so unlikely he has Aces here right uh maybe some king queen very rarely right so since we have the best hand so often here small de size uh is very good we will be losing a lot of value if we don't do it hero goes for it and gets paid by the queen Jack so um that's uh very well play in in the river uh getting the extra value but he should have bet the Flop too so he um he was lucky that they V bet this hand which he probably should have checked back uh very frequent a very high frequency going to the Flop yeah Queen Jack just checks every single time so we got value from the Flop from the billing mistake but not because we play the hand correctly going into the last hand we have Hero opening 25 B from under the two so under the two 25 B this range about 21% hands and uh let's play the hand out the bottom calls and uh the bottom range again at this stack dep with 25 B LS button versus this is plus two so here the bottom will have a non inting range and a reg range if he has exactly 25 big blanks the calling range is pretty wide here calling about about 18 sorry 15% hands so uh really wide range compared to the other the previous situations and this range is actually if you look them side by side again uh the calling range here in green overlaps a lot with this range the main difference is that this one will have less combinations and we'll be missing some of the Ace King um or card type of hands that will be Tri or or the regs but for the most part both ranges will have a lot of overlapping uh this bran will be a lot more suited and that's a factor in in a suited board board G suit so here on Jack 32 again um you should start think um who has all of the sets uh who has the over PA strongest hand here for example you know sets which um three and deuces the opening range doesn't have right so Tre and Deuces IP would have combinations of those uh even in in this situation maybe all of them right if you think about it in a tournament probably players will always call up these pocket pairs even if they're not like super profitable or whatever people just always call him with this stack deps and so you can expect him to have all of the combinations of sets here maybe Jack uh he will be titing always but there will be some slow playing pocket Jacks here and here of course has all the Jacks now middling strength hands 10 NES eights they belong in the hero range right a lot of of the time the bottom will be tting um those hands at a very high frequency tens and nines so we can start to imagine again what is happening here right uh about suited nness um this range has a bunch of suited stuff here um uh and then more a few more Su connectors than um the um the opening range has and has less offsuit combinations here so uh and he also traps Aces and Kings with some frequency queens and Jacks with some frequency so again I'm just trying to connect the the Dots here um you can probably start to figure out to um um predict what type of bed sizes or beding frequency will be happening this board now let's um bring the GTO simulation and it's not surprised that uh the solber wants to check so frequently right because again um has a lot of hands that uh benefit from just playing passively like 10 and NES eight sevens right that require um they uh benefit from just playing small pods and all of this Bing frequency uh when you see a split between half and half it's probably because the best beted size is somewhere in between these two beted sizes but again it's not a big deal the total Bing frequency is so so uh low that I probably just check my range here I wouldn't be betting pretty much any hands at all because trying to mix up all of these and getting the right lovs and all of that it's just very difficult to do so I just probably check my range looking at equities they go 50 but the main difference here will be the polarization advantage that um IP has right so let's look at how the hand played out now um here went for the uh small bet with pocket six uh he has clubs and diamonds clubs and diamonds so um in general pocket six is a hand that you know could be bet with the small frequency here um he wouldn't lose a bunch of e so it's fine um not a huge mistake yet calls King of Diamonds on the turn and now the hero checks billan checks behind read is the ace of diamonds and the hero decides to go for the um a large bed here and turn his hand into a bluff and he gets called by Ace Jack so uh how would the Sol approach the situation well the S will mostly be checking here but as plate betting small then Ace Jack uh sometimes racing mostly um mostly just calling this combo actually should be racing more but um uh the these two combos that don't have back FL should be raising more the back to with the diamond just happy to see more turn there are more turns that uh increase his Equity so he's he's fine just calling here at this St at this shallow stack um as plate you go B call King of Diamonds and interesting enough now now here um um uh switch to a checking with a combo that actually wants to bed more frequently of sixes here now we uh block combinations of A6 suited um and 76 suited that are suit connectors in this range uh that will be calling so it makes more sense to to keep barreling now and again we also block some floats with you know s the diamonds here so this is is Perfect combo to keep Bing the turn turn card should be much better for the hero and this is another thing you should be thinking uh when the turn card comes again about the ranges in play and how this turn card uh who's improve who improves more right if we look at the hotness um uh hit map here the King of Diamonds is one of the best cards for the out of position range right he increases hero Equity so kings are really good and we missed on this opportunity to putting another B here another bet here right uh if we bet um here we take a small bet size again hero calls V calls and then is the ace of diamonds and now we have a nice bluff with the pocket sixes right just turning seven sixes and fives into a bluff and just jam and you put hands like you know a Jack in a a difficult spot King Jack what king Jack call because two pairs Queen Jack's in difficult spot um now many uh Ace Jack maybe calls because he he too pair but maybe some wicker players might be um scared and a hands like Ace Queen just you know difficult spot eeve wise are very little Eevee for chips here on the river when the pot is already um 177 chips is is so close to zero that uh is almost close to indiffer then uh a Queen of Clubs um definitely uh a worse call than this because it blocks both the clubs that might love the river uh so if if the he had bet the turn and then uh Jam the river it will actually be a really good play that should get through a lot uh as play um and it it is fine I guess but as played I don't think you should be just you should be blocking uh because now you definitely definitely don't rep as much you will be getting diamonds on the on the turn at high frequency when the king comes uh so even if you have the blocker it doesn't really matter as much and the villain will also have a bunch of ax in his range and King X maybe not so much but Jack hex and he will probably just call you off so we go back the fer um when it go check check Ace of Diamonds now sixes this combination is actually really bad because now we block uh we um we have um we block some of the worse hands that they the the villain will be uh falling into a bed right like clubs that didn't improve M like 67 for example stuff like that doesn't really matter as much but the thing is um it also has Showdown value the um D here might um just check check back randomly some um some worse hands here um maybe um pocket FES just checks and you know we win and so there's no need the PO is not as large when it went check check on the turn uh compared to what it will be if he goes Check bet bet all right uh so this is the final hand um really hope you guys found this uh this webinar useful I think I went over time uh by a lot I apologize for that uh maybe you know um some of you had already somewhere to go but I wanted to cover them uh the hands completely um Merry Christmas to everyone thank you a lot I really appreciate you guys coming here and well happy Christmas and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year I see you all hope to see you all again back here next year um best of luck to to everyone bye", metadata={'source': 'CC7WNLCLTf8', 'title': 'How

[Document(page_content="hey everybody this is Alexander Fitzgerald or sassinato doing another one of my webinars for Jonathan little today we are going to be discussing exploitative continuation bet sizing refining our Basics why you should change your back sizes 90 plus percent of your opponents in an hbt are in a low six cash games have no idea who you are they are generally playing their hand and not getting too calibrated versus players like this you can manipulate them with some basic bet changes today I'm going to show you how to exploit basic regulars so you can make more money so the truth is guys with the vast majority of opponents they're more or less playing their cards in their fixed strategy and if you know what those fixed strategies tend to be and they tend to be the same ones all over the world uh just because people tend to learn poker the same way you can manipulate them somewhat so we're going to talk about that today but what about balancing is something a lot of people ask balancing is important when you're playing against higher level opponents I I was lucky enough to make a final table in Prague at the butt end of 2016 for example and there I had to do a lot of balancing because versus very educated opponents there's no C betting 100 of the time but it it's also important to be balancing when you play the same people every day and in wcp 2ks and hire you a Euro one case and higher in cash games will require require balancing uh just because you're going to be playing against the same people every day but for the vast majority of people you only get so many hands with them it's going to be about 40 or 50 and if they've never really seen you and that that has to go with cash games or tournaments as well if they've never really seen you in those 40 and 50 hands they're going to have their way they're going to react and that's going to be it we can manipulate them this Playbook I use this Playbook often when I'm playing against people the first time it's been very useful in Stateside wpts up to 3.5 K's and most tournaments in Vegas uh the higher Stakes venations that that's when people start attacking your seabeds a little bit more and obviously wcp 2K isn't higher uh it works great in tournaments up to 200 weekday tournaments in uh online tournaments so online if you're playing Sunday Majors you're fine that if you're playing up to 109s during the weekdays you're fine but those 162 200 daily tournaments that that's where people start attacking you online so I wouldn't use this stuff as much there and again it has to do with the player base if it's a very educated player base which is more rare Than People realize they're going to be attacking cbets quite frequently but the vast majority of even regs that make a little money the way they make their money is they open when people are online likely to three bet them they three bet when people are unlikely to four about them and they have a pretty good C betting strategy themselves if they call you from the big blind for example maybe they're just looking to hit a piece of flop and that's where we can get a little something but there's different ways to go about this let's let's take a look at let's take a look at a hypothetical situation so here uh you have 10 7 of diamonds on the button you raise to two and a half times the big line the big line calls you the board comes eight clubs Four Diamonds three of Spades it gets checked to you of these options which one would you like to take you could even bet larger why do you think we should bet larger there so the the first one we're going to analyze is that in 66 to 75 percent pot and you'll notice most people that have pot but I put 66 or 75 now why is that let me ask you something when you continuation bet here what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought what is the most important thought anyone want to guess in the chat what the most important thing is to think of here now the reason guys I hammered on this so much so I uh long story short I put together a playbook for my students that was very successful with a lot of that and then with certain students who were just as smart as the other ones I noticed they weren't being as successful and that really confused me because some of these guys were so intelligent I wasn't even in their zip code and eventually so I did some reading I was trying to figure out why do people why can people perform well when they study enduring simulations but not so much in the field and something I found that was shared by a lot of Elite performers is the focus on one two or three items so Navy Seals for example in those guys some of them are multilingual demolition experts bodybuilders right like if there's anybody who can remember anything it would be those guys well when they're when they go into the field they only are given one two or three things to remember uh if any of you follow American football Bill Belichick uh the head coach of the New England Patriots probably the most successful dynasty of all time in the NFL when he is at halftime and he's giving people things to remember for the second half he has a rule that it has to be three fangs it can't be more than three things it can be one thing two thing or three things but it can't be four and I find we get more results in No Limit Hold'em when we focus on specific thoughts okay because let's be honest we've all looked at this situation a hundred times before and there's a lot of things to look at one person in the chat said could he possibly check raise me uh what am I trying to set up on the turn and River uh does that board hit his range or my range more all of that stuff is great but we can start with one thought that if we understand this question and the answer of it it makes everything else Superfluous not as big of a deal that's where we should start from now obviously if you get a more complex opponent you do have to broaden out the thoughts you are thinking to become a little bit more exacting in your ways but for the vast majority of poker hands we don't have to go that complicated I still use what we're going to talk about here even in Atlantic City wpts and whatnot so you want to see that to fold out High cards the biggest question to ask yourself here is how can I get rid of the high cards and I bet a lot of you answered that you were saying how can I get him to just fold with when he missed this board yeah High cards okay different phrasing but the same thing now here's my question you want to see bet to fold out High cards right will betting half pot do that if you know tell me because I don't know a lot of guys will call with their Ace highs of any kind with a half pot bat when there's two wheel cards out there others will fold it's a little more likely actually much more likely they'll fold if I bet bigger and obviously less likely they'll fold if I bet smaller let's say I bet this much 450. how often does this need to work guys what do you do mathematically to figure out how often this works this is one of the first things I learned when I started learning poker very beginning this is the beginning of your poker studies well you do 450 the amount you're risking divided by the pot you're gonna get back when he folds because that 450 doesn't go off into the ether it comes back to you if uh you're right any folds so you do 450 divided by 1080 here and you're gonna find that your bet as a complete Bluff needs to work 41.6 repeating percent of the time and if anybody is a little puzzled why it's an uneven number there remember the Annie is 10 here so the reason you bet this large is because if you you get the guy to fold High cards on most boards without two cards nine or higher uh then you're printing money let me say that that was a little confusing if the board does not have two cards nine or higher then generally the person has mostly High cards if you get him to fold those High cards almost any bat up to the size of the pot will be profitable many basic players will fall for the tactic I just showed you their whole life they have seen half pot sized bats you put out a slightly larger bet a lot of guys will go huh that's weird and then they mock their high card which is all we want that's it we're not expecting them to fold pairs that's a big ask but maybe just a bear race right that doesn't haven't got shot hell I still have guys in wpts that fall for this tactic guys I would not teach it to you if I did not use it myself and this is something you can bring up all the time with satellite winners or like okay Rags that are used to dealing with half pot sized bets oh if you're uh if you're an older gentleman or lady they're just gonna think you have the nuts when you bet bigger actually if they fold you should apply you should beef that up right after they fold just go I hate pocket jacks or something like that that is an awesome image to have now if you had to pick another answer here which one would it be there's one other exploitative play here which requires a bit more finesse so let's say you've got 200 here into 6 30. and he calls the turn is the queen of hearts now what do you do you bet just a little over half paw anything over half pot would be good why would I do that well let's go back to the flop when we bet that small and he calls what do you think he is calling with what do we think he's calling with let's make this a group activity well now he's probably calling me with all of his Ace highs because come on guys We All Fall for this tiny bat we have a high card we feel weak folding I know all about this plan I'll tell you what if I have a seven year and someone bets 200 I feel really silly folding but the problem is what happens if the guy calls with ace high We All Fall for this tiny bet we have a high card we feel weak folding and that's when we get them or that's when they get us rather because that term comes and it's anything but an Ace and we fire anything slightly above half paw and it looks like we're trying to get value now so we're betting 550 here to win 1580 our bet needs to work as a pure Bluff 35 of the time so we're going to round up so what does that mean what's the next thing I'm going to say guys if our bet needs to work as a pure Bluff 35 of the time what does that mean for our opponent he needs to defend with 65 of his hands however if we throw a queen out there and look at the statistics we find that he doesn't even have a pair of 45 percent of the time which means even if he defends with every parent draw he's not defending 65 of his hands he's only defending 55 of his hands I love this play because most guys will call with a high card or a gut shot once versus a small bet because probably they should but then on the turn when they miss and you fire a quote substantial bet out there they'll let it go what they don't realize is they're getting worked there's one other bet you can do here I only use it maybe 10 of the time but I'll use it with a young guy who's getting angry with me I love these in Planet Hollywood tournaments small events in Europe wsopc events let's see if you can get this this also works out online too you get a lot of LOLs in the chat alright guys what do you think it is time is up you can just bet a little 850 there into the pot of 6 30. so you bet 850 guys how do I figure out how often this needs to work If This Were poker 101 this is the first thing they would teach you you do 850 divided by 1480. that means our bet as a pure Bluff needs to work 57 of the time so what does that mean guys for our opponent I'm going to pause here for a second if you haven't thought about it think about it it means he needs to defend with 43 of his hands the problem is if he defends with any pair that's only 35 percent of his range this is a fun uh for those of you who are familiar with baseball I call this the change up just because nobody expects it and you get with young guys I love this play because you get a lot of poop and then they fold which is fine I I'm I'm fine looking Dom right but it's been a long time since I did this bet and somebody figured out what I was doing and they decided to raise or something because most of the time in the states I I don't know why this is but most people as long as you don't leave them looking stupid they'll full that's at low in Middle stakes and if it's like a WPT in Baltimore that's a lot of satellite winners and stuff like that right despite it being a more substantial buy and it's going to be people that generally play 500s and 400s and stuff like that so as long as you're not as long as you're allowing them to save face they'll usually Let It Go and in this case in common poker parlance you're kind of seen as the nut case here so it's not really on them to feel silly some final notes guys everything we looked at had to do with the big blind calling you we started with that situation because it is the most common continuation betting setting in the limit Hold'em do not do these bet sizes versus a cold collar I'm going to repeat that do not do these bed sizes versus a cold caller a 12 cold calling range is much different than a 35 big blind flatting range so this is a common misconception that comes up every time I teach this which is oh that ain't really big to fall down high cards is good versus the big blind calling you I guess it's pretty good all the time well I'm really glad that you understand now that the big blind calls with too many hands and is on most boards is gonna have mostly High cards and you can get away with a really big bet but that's because they're calling with 35 40 of the hands almost regardless of where you raise that's why we're focusing on that spot to begin with it which is go count the number of times the big blind calls you and it's just you and him and any medium Stakes tournament it's going to be 30 40 50 of your final Hands by the end of the tournament so you really need to have that spot down now if somebody cold calls either mid position this is a much more rare spot because usually if somebody cold calls you a mid position now the big Line's gonna flash you so it's a multi-way pot in which case you should not see that as a complete Bluff because the majority of the time both players have not have not missed but if you were to get cold called and the blinds folded the cold caller only has like 12 percent of hands that is a third of the hands the big blind has do not fire big uh a buddy of mine was nice enough uh to start telling me it to start teaching me what the solvers say the solvers are much bigger on small bets versus the cold calling ranges but to make sure that these large bet sizes are a good idea I've been taking lessons on GTO solvers and we've been testing bigger bets uh this is just something I pulled from the website by the way until look uh read too much into this versus big blinds versus big blind calling ranges they do look pretty good the bigger bets uh the solver does not say that though about seabedding in a cold calling ranges that's a more varied approach approach a much more nuanced approach what boards should I attack uh this guys I would take a screenshot of if uh if you would like to what boards should I attack boards should get a small bet because he's either got the ace or he doesn't so I know it's tempting to read this really quickly as I'm talking guys but I'd really encourage you just to listen to me right now because we're gonna go through a bunch of different boards and how you can attack them since I don't have that much time today uh I ah I'm gonna go through this a little bit more briefly than I would prefer to but this stuff is very important so on an ace high board what is the most exploitative way to play well when you have a really good Ace bet eighty percent of the pot because if he has an ace he's not folding ever and that pot is going to be so big by the river and he's gonna have a really hard time folding right and if he has second pair what usually people do when they have second pair on an acai board is they'll call they'll call flop and they'll full turn because they assume the second time you fire you have the ace so that first bat should be really big now if you have nothing and again this guy doesn't know you from Adam and are this is just someone you don't play with every day or somebody you're running into in a tournament what you can do is BET like one third pot because that bet needs to work 25 percent of the time but that means your opponent needs to defend 75 of the time that is very unlikely to happen the really good thing about a sideboards is there's no way for your opponent to have over cards so they usually just have the ace or they don't have it and if they do have something like 10-9 uh there's no way for that to be over cards or anything so any bet will usually fold them out unless of course they picked up like a gut shot in a backdoor draw or something but the vast majority of a cold calling range and the big blind is not going to have that uh two cards nine or higher should also receive a small bat so people tend to cold call with high cards they don't call with medium cards they don't they don't really like low cards it's some medium cards and a lot of high cards so when you see a board with two cards that are nine or higher that tends to be a little bit covering the cold calling range right so here's the thing on those boards let's say the board comes king queen too a lot of the same things apply that apply on Ace High boards uh the person has a really hard time having high cards the only high card there is an ace uh so there's not we don't have to worry about big comma draws having to price them out the person usually has a king or a queen or they don't so again a very small bet will work if let's say the person cold called you in middle position that might not be the best board to see about because that is all over the person's cold calling range right you might want to back off there but in the big blind there's still enough like nine six suited and ten eight off suits in order to justify a small bet maybe not half pot uh three cards nine or below with no straight draw can handle any of the bets we saw today that is uh one of my favorite boards I like to sucker people in with that really small bat get the like okay I don't know what you're doing call and then get them to fold on the term because that's just an extra 200 ships in my pocket and if you ratchet that up if you collect those throughout the day in a tournament that's going to add up to let's say nine big blinds at the end of a tournament that doesn't sound like much but everybody listening to this has likely come back from nine big blinds at some point in a tournament and made a really serious run of it if they didn't win the tournament so having that extra nine big blinds is like having a second life in tournament poker and as you can imagine if everybody else enters the tournament with one life and you have two lives that's excellent so these are the fun most fun boards to manipulate you can throw in that over bed if you have a pissy young kid uh you can just go for the bigger bed if you just want to spell it out for them uh you can sucker them in with that small bet and then a big bet uh one Broadway two low cards can handle the same thing generally uh so that's like King XX Queen XX uh Jack XX now if you have a nine in there right if it starts putting flush and straight draws out there uh you might not want to get as cute with the small bed but generally the bigger bets will work but yeah if it's just King four two again you could do the over bet you can do the one third pot size bat you can do two thirds pot size bat and flusher straight boards uh this is something I don't hear talked about enough but flusher straight boards are great for double barrels so get some money in the middle on the flop you that is one of the very few situations I really like a half pot bet because what happens is is someone has a pair of any type on a flush drug board or a straight draw board they're still gonna call if you fire the seat belt they're just gonna hope like hell if the card comes out there on the turn that you're just gonna give up so you fire half pot the person's gonna miss the board enough on three to a suit as long as it doesn't have two cards nine or higher three to a suit or three to a straight seven six five they're going to have missed enough to justify the half pot size bed but if they do call and the turn is an eight on the 765 board or the turn is a fourth heart on the three heart board what happens is they have missed that turn they did not make a draw sixty percent of the time minimum so pretty much any bet out there is going if you think it's going to fold out the pairs is going to turn a profit so you can fire a little bit more substantially and just pocket what they put in on the middle so the problem I find when you bet one third part of those boards is you kind of tell the person I don't have a big hand because if you think about it if the board came seven six five and you had a set of sixes you really it's really unlikely you'd be betting one third pod because you'd be justifiably a bit worried about a straight draw coming in right so if you bet halfpod it still looks like you could have a little something and then you get to pick up a little extra money when you bet the turn alright guys that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this one I'll see you for the next one of these take care good luck to you if you're playing today", metadata={'source': 'V6VMskKAR6o', 'title': 'How to EXPLOIT With Bet Sizing!', 'description': 'Unknown',

[Document(page_content="all right everyone welcome so what I've been kind of doing this world series is taking notes of just common situations or things that I come up uh common mistakes that I see people making over and over again and one of the most common ones is with bet sizing and so in my opinion when you are you know starting out beginning of the tournament one of the quickest most reliable ways to tell how good someone is at poker is through the BET sizing that they choose and the way people are altering their bet sizes or using wrong sizes on certain boards or correct sizes on certain boards is often a very tall uh you know a very telling sign of how studied the person is and how they think about the game of poker and that's kind of like one of my first indications of whether I think a player is very weak or very strong um while playing and so I thought today like we've talked about bet size in the past I think it's one of the things that like a lot of bad Rags what separates a lot of bad Rags from good Rags is being able to size correctly in certain spots and one of the things also I've seen this summer is just like the very very misuse of overb bets uh people trying to overb because they're no supposed to overb in spots but they're over betting in spots where you just don't get to overb um and so that's why today we we'll be talking about bet sizing and kind of giving you a framework of how to think while you're in game to help you choose between um bet sizes and focusing more on like small sizings or large sizings you're never going to get bet sizing exactly right um obviously in a solver you can put 30 different bet Siz sizes and it's going to choose whatever one's the correct SI sizing for different portions of your range we're human we're not trying to do that so um often I'll only play like maybe two sizings in a spot and yeah trying to uh figure out what sizings make this the most sense and hopefully today we'll give you a very good framework for that uh the best way to get uh things out of today's webinar um is to answer the questions I don't care if you're right I don't care if you're wrong but you want to have an answer so that if you're wrong you can start to figure out why you were wrong and that's how you're going to learn and how you're going to approve versus if you don't have an answer you know and answer and also kind of think of the why why are you saying that answer what's your reasoning behind it so so kind of the title of today's webinar is BET sizing the small and big game so bet fre betting frequency and size ing um often our frequency and sizing of our betting strategy can be answered with two questions who wins the small game and who wins the big game so let's talk about the small game first uh the small game is often dictated by who has the most low Equity hands in their range um this is often referred to as air or how often they miss and whoever has less air or misses the flop less often generally wins the small game and there's different varying degrees like how much do you win the small game by all can be um Parts uh of the answer so small game winners are allowed to bet more frequently and for a smaller size to fold out the air of the other player so when one player has a lot of air in their range you can bet thinner for Value because the range that going to call you is going to be weaker so therefore you can bet much thinner for value and it doesn't have to be this polarizing bet because the range that continues versus your small bet is going to be very wide and have less Equity so you don't need a strong Equity hand to be betting for value or protection uh the big game the big game often is answered by who has the most high Equity hands in their range um now notice I'm saying Equity hands high Equity hands and in the small game I'm saying low Equity hands um on different flops different hands have different types of equity profiles so I'm not just referring to you know sets you know overpays the nuts necessarily there's a lot of different hands that can have very high equity on different flops so we're going to take a look into that um higher Equity hands often can be betting large however if you're not winning the big game and your opponent can also have those High Equity hands those large bets um tend to go away so when you get a bet large is when there's a gap between the amount of high Equity hands that one player has and the amount of high Equity hands that another player has and it's those differences that allow some large bets to begin to creep in so winning both games it is possible to win both the small game and the big game uh this can lead to a split strategy where both small bets and big bets are used so we're going to talk about some examples here um and first we're going to look at some button versus big blind spots and we'll look at a couple of different stack depths here um I have these are older Sims that I have run on my computer right now to explain what I want to look at uh so we're going to start off with a few of these you know pretty common flops we got like a king Jack Deuce flop 74 Deuce type of flop and a six Jack 65 I'm not sure if I have these exact back flops but we're going to find specific structures here let's just actually let's ask this question first of these three flops button versus big blind and let's say we are 100 big blinds effective okay 100 big blinds that way we can really get some you know which of these flops one of these flops is going to bet small one of these flops is going to bet large and one of these flops is going to bet kind of like you know like we'll say one one's going to bet very large and one's going to bet like kind of a medium to large more of the middle of the two which of these flops at like a 100 big blinds is going to correlate to one of these three bet sizes here so King Jack Deuce 74 dece Jack 65 two tone which one's betting small which one's betting very large like an overb or pot size and which one's kind of betting medium to large so let's start with first uh which of these flops is going to bet small and I believe it's going to be king Jack Deuce flop is going to bet small uh 74 Deuce I think is in bet very large probably an over bet and then Jack 65 is going to kind of be in the middle okay so a lot of people were saying King Jack Deuce is very large lar and 74 is very small so we're going to focus kind of on these two flops and not as much on the jack 65 cuz it's kind of in the middle and hopefully um you could kind of understand why so let's pull up first so King Jack Deuce why why do you think I'm saying that we bet small on King Jack Deuce so I'm going to highlight here the um big blinds range right here and first let me ask you this who wins the small game on King 10 deuce and why who wins the small game on King 10 deuce and why this is the big blinds range right here and here's the buttons range right here so I'm going to show I can show you the answer we check and you notice here there's three possible answers 30% 65% and 100% And as you can see here you only bet 30% and you bet 100% of the time for 30% okay it simply has to do with the big blind has a lot more air in the spot than us so we have every offsuit 10x we have every offsuit kingx the bottom of our range even like Queen 8 has an overcard to the 10 has back door straight draw some of them have a spade Jack eight has an overcard to the 10 some of them have a spade but all of them even Jack of clubs a of diamonds can turn an open ated straight draw obviously all these King acts are a pair of kings are Ace highs yes they're air like Ace Duce but at least we have an overcard to the king we don't have many cards with two undercards to the 10 right everything has like reasonable Equity here and you can see why like like when I go here the equity out of position we don't have that much red and orange here like 87 off 86 off 76 off like um we have less misses than the big blind when we look at the big blinds range here there's a lot more offit junk here there is every single suited junk here 83 73 all this stuff that we we we don't have down here um all this stuff is junk obviously the Deuces can be a pair but they still have a lot of equity um so the big blinds like if you can think about it this way too in position we have uh the big blind has 59% of hands we have 53 so we have a slightly tighter range but we also have you know all the pocket pairs all the king Queens King Jacks King 10 suited Ace Jack Ace Queen Ace King you know we have a lot more of the stronger hands in the range now the big thing is is why do we not get a bet big here so see some all of these answers that are like not wrong but I don't think they're like the best here and it mostly has to do with like the top pair it's very easy for the big blind here to have a decent top pair like they can have King 10 off they can have Deuces they can have king deuce off they can have King dece suited like in terms of the really strong hands the only really strong hands they don't have are pocket kings and tens but it doesn't really matter there because they make up such a small percentage of our ring so here it's really how many top pairs do we have that they don't have so we have Ace King and they don't we have king queen uh in this simulation they do not have king queen suited but they have a little bit of king queen off now how many people do we think are just calling 100% like 95% of the time three like this has them three betting king queen off like 90% of the time um I think a lot of people just call in the big blind with king queen off um King jack off and like let's say they have king queen here because they have King Jack at like almost full weight the issue then is is like the only hands that we really want to start betting really big with are like Ace King and King Queen that's it Kings doesn't make sense to bet big with much pocket 10 doesn't really make much sense with because it doesn't need much protection and you block a lot of the calls so we're really not winning the big game that much because the big blank can just have king queen and king Jack here and you don't really want to be by betting bigger what you're doing is they fold more and then you're narrowing their range to these stronger hands more often okay so the only over pair we have that wants to bet big here is aces so in terms of these bet big spots a lot of times it's going to be who has the overpair advantage and who has the strongest top par like kicker wise Advantage it's not who has the sets in two pairs a lot because they just make up such a small percentage of your range we're not really worried about that until later in the hand on the Flop we're kind of worried about like how many top pairs can we press our small bet Advantage like air advantage here and when we bet small here okay I don't know why my search thing is so we're betting 30 to win 120 uh 30 to win 130 when we Bluff here the pots 100 if we bet 30 we're bet risking 30 chips to went 130 so if it was 120 we'd expect a fold about 25% of the time so we need a fold slightly less than that like 23% when we bet small here they're folding almost 44% of the time and the reason is is because they have all this 98 off 97 off 96 off 86 76 75 Queen 5 Queen 4 Queen 3 Jack five like all this air that's just autof folds right like they're folding 45% of the time we only need them to fold 23% right so therefore we're just profitably bluffing with any two cards because they're folding too much does that make sense so that was the first flop why we bet small let's look at 74 deuce and we'll see if I have the very next flop and this flop here I I said we were going to bet really big on 74 du so I want to show this Equity graph okay this is really kind of a cool tool here to use in this Equity graph so in the equity graph here you can see so what this basically does is presents the um how much Equity each hand has and like the percentage of their range so like our best hand here is at the 100th perc so our best hand is like you know are both like pocket Deuces like we have slightly um more and then the it goes down to like our worst hand is like 53 suited their worst hand is 73 suited essentially so at every point you can see we have this nice little Gap in our equities this is what I was talking about with we were we're winning both the small game and the big game here however we're just betting small because cuz there's not a lot of hands here like in terms of the big game it starts to get a little bit narrower up here um we're going to start to polarize more on the turn so here we're at 60 and I have seven4 dece but this is two tone so we're slightly different stock size here and it's going to change a little bit because it's two- tone so 74 Deuce so what's the main difference here between 74 deuce and King Jack in terms of the small game the big blind has a lot of err here but what happened to the buttons range here the button has a lot of air too we have too much now like Queen Jack King 10 Queen 10 Jack 10 Ace 9 Ace 10 king8 suited King do suited all this we we have a lot of air now as well because we missed this flop because we rais with offit eights and offit N9 and offit 10 and Jacks so we don't hit a pair very often on this board right the big blind doesn't hit a pair pair there very often either both players have a lot of air right it's not that hard on 74 Duce to realize that both players miss this flop a lot but what's the difference here with the big game the overpair advantage is what's going to drive the betting here we have eights nines tens Jacks Queens Kings Aces we also are going to have A7 King seven we have A7 off King seven off A7 suited King seven suited um all the hands that the big blank does not have so now we tie in the small the we we kind of tie maybe the button wins a little bit in the air game cuz you know but both players miss the flop a lot and both players have a lot of air okay and the button wins the big game by a lot because all their over pairs if we look here the big blind doesn't have eights nines tens Jacks Queens Kings Aces they have A7 is basically their best hand they don't have 74 off they don't have four Deuce off they got have pocket fours and pocket Deuces and pocket sevens sure but so we win this big game with our overcards so what's going to be our strategy on this board I already told you we're going to bet very large are we going to bet a lot are we going to check a lot like what's kind of our strategy here so what should happen here is we're going to check and we should bet very large a lot and never check and this is the thing that people screw up is they don't realize that we just check a lot here why can't we bet 100% of the time here why why do we check so much here on 74 Deuce we check a lot because we have too much air so it has nothing to do with balance it has nothing to do with any of that it's because we have too much air to bet if we just start betting 30 like betting 100% of the time small what happens when we get check raised we're just screwed because we have too much air in our range now and so hm let's look at what hands want a bet very large 100% of the time there's a lot of mixing that goes on here but let's focus on the hands that always bet notice we're checking about 50% of the time just ignore this small bet here we just bet large this is an over bet by the way we're betting 73 and 61 okay we're betting really big eight nines tens Jacks Queens Kings Aces ace7 King seven Queen Seven suited those are the hands that want to bet 100% of the time fours induces okay it's that simple not that hard to find that range now how do we balance that range out let's say oh when we bet 73 and they call what's the most common hand they're going to have I hope it's not sets because it's it's it's not good for us if we're we're betting 1.25x pot with Jack and they call us and they have sets or two pairs it's going to be a pair of sevens or a pair of fours okay they have nothing else to call with here so we're going to have a seven or four so what hands are we bluffing with hands that have decent Equity against a seven or four 98 108 10 n I'm just looking at the hands that bet the most 53 suited um 98 suited 108 suited 10 n suited Jack n suited jack8 suited Jack 10 off Queen eight off King five off you know like we're just betting that our weakest overcard hands that have reasonable Equity against a pair of sevens or a pair of fours now on these offsuit ones we prefer to have a spade like Queen 10 with the Queen of Spades Queen nine with the Queen of Spades Jack eight with the Jack Spades 10 n with the Spade because when they we bet and they call oh what do you know they have a pair of sevens they have a pair of fours or they sometimes have a pair of Deuces it's not that complicated or they're just going to fold 100% of the time it's like they don't get to choose to not call with anything here because the Flop didn't give them much so we're betting really big on this board because both players lose the small game because they have so much air and they get a bet really big because we have this big overpair Advantage now what do I see a lot of people do here what what's a lot of people's strategy on this board 74 dece it's like bet 25% but the problem with that is let's say I'm in the big blind I have a hand like s six I don't really want to check raise you because I don't have eights nines 10 Jacks Queens Kings Aces I'm just opening myself for you to just kind of Blast away with these over Pairs and like Blast away with 109 offit because yes I can have 74 suited every once in a while or pocket fours every once in a while or pocket Deuces but really I just have a pair of sevens and you can really just put me in the cage so I'm not going to really check raise much because I don't have the over pairs to protect myself yeah like you know if I bet small here yeah I can check raise A7 I can check raise King 7 you know check raise pocket sevens or pocket fours 74 or whatever but like they raise like you just it's we're not getting enough money into the pot by betting small with when we have Jacks you guys one of the biggest things is everyone's nuking money by not betting big in these spots with Jacks this is an overb you're betting 120% of the pot okay if this was 100 big blinds you probably bet like 200% of the pot here you had really really big the bigger the bigger the the S stacked pot ratio almost here the bigger you bet okay so let's not spent as much time but let's look at look at Jack 54 Jack 54 here it's actually using a lot of small betting here and I would have bet maybe a little bit more medium size here but why are we betting small here and not betting really big and there's two things going on here yeah the straight and flush draws so there's two things one it's Jack high so really we only really have an advantage around ace Jack and then Aces kings and queens okay so that's number one is the blank can have King Jack right and you notice here the big blind can have Ace Jack so we really don't want to start blasting away with King Jack when the big blank can just have Ace jacked so it's really just Queens Kings and aces are the only hands that really want to bet big here so that's number one the high card that's why we bet larger on lower high cardboards almost always and we don't really bet large on AI flops because the big blind has more coverage of top pair with decent kickers it's the over pair pairs that are really allowing you to bet large because the big blind can't have them the other thing is if we start betting really large on this board the big blind just has so many combo draws like if we bet 100 here we just really start to narrow the range to like8 six of Spades or 7 six or you know all these like nut flush draws King High flush draws like let's say we have Ace Jack okay and we bet 100% of the pot and they call with Queen nine of Spades what have we accomplished there so it's not that we incentivize the big blind to stay in the pot pot because we'd rather bet small ace Jack just bets small here doesn't want to bet big why the bigger we bet the more they fold and therefore the more we narrow their range to Stronger hands this board is connected and has a flush drop so the bigger we bet the more likely the opponent just has Queen nine of Spades King three of Spades Queen three of Spades baits uh seven six of Hearts 63 suited how is Ace Jack doing against those hands is it dominating them or is it flipping against them it's flipping so you don't get any value so we need a bet small to allow wider hands to come in to in order to get value with Ace Jack so one of the biggest mistakes I see with bet sizing and I want you to pause this if you're watching the recording and relisten to this like three times CU this might be the probably the most important thing in this webinar the more connected and flush draw the board so if there's a flush draw on the board and it's connected as in there's a lot of open-ended straight draws possible you don't want to bet big because you're narrowing their range too much to combo draws and strong draws that if you have like even if you have like kings here you're just going to narrow the range to too many combo draws that are doing um really well well against your Ace Jack King Jack pocket queens now if I made this to like a four of Hearts different story because there's no flush draws now or if I made the four of Spades the deu of Spades different story because there's less straight draws now so if you were here last week it was the same mistake I made when I had Queen nine of diamonds on versus a small blind and I bet big on Jack five on Jack 54 two diamonds and I wasn't supposed to bet big because I just narrowed the small blinds range way too much to ace high and King High flush draws and open-ended straight draws so we can look here at 853 twoone it's kind of different it's not as so we have a lot of straight draws a lot of FL a flush draw but the issue is here which we have um overpays right so this has kind of got two things going on where it's a flush drop board we're probably not going to like so you okay here we go you see there's kind of two strategies going on here now on 853 when we added the flush draw here we still want to bet big with these hands that need like pocket 9ines pocket 10s Jacks Queens like we need a lot of value and protection however there's a lot of hands we don't necessarily want to bet really big with like 108 for example or Jack eight we want to bet smaller because we don't want to narrow their range too much to these combo draws in general when there's a flush draw on the board it caps the size you want to bet so but again here a lot of checking on this low card board um I want to change the situation completely though okay and we're going to go to my favorite flop here we're ajck 10 rainbow okay um so I don't want to click it yet so what this situation is for 40 big blinds effective the cut off raises the button calls and the Flop comes ajack 10 rainbow and I want you to guys to describe using the terms the big game and the small game what our strategy is going to be on the Flop from the cut off give you guys one minute and I want you to think about this everyone needs to think about this and yep so cut off raises you can look up here if you need it cut off versus button 40 big blinds so using the term small game and big game what is the cut off strategy going to be give you guys a hint because I'm seeing some of the answers now you need to think about both players ranges here so here's the cutoff range okay so Ace Jack 10 ace high hands obviously doing good these King High hands are doing all right because they have a gut shot these Queen High hands are all right CU they're doing a gut shot Jack High hands have a pair 10 high hands have a pair and then we have all these small Pairs and these pseud connectors that are doing right so everything down here is kind of doing everything else is fine okay now let's go button ver raise from the cut off well cut off has all the ax cut off has all the king X they have you know Queen Jack Queen 10 note here they don't have King Nine they don't have king8 they don't have King seven they don't have King six you know they have the same Pairs and some of the pseud connectors the cut off the button wins this small game why does the button win the small game the button calls 17.7% of hands the button calls 17.7% of hands the cut off raises with 38% of hands they have more king8 they have more King induc more King 3 more Queen 4 more Jack six suited 10 six suited 86 suited you know yes ace5 is doing slightly better on this board but not really now the small game maybe it's a little bit more tied You could argue that as well but certainly like both players don't have much air who wins the big game so we can look here at the ranges I can show you here's the butt range and here's the cutoffs range who wins the big game cutoff wins the big game how does the cutoff win the big game when how does the cut off win the big game when we can have king queen off we can have Aces we can have Jacks we can have 10 we can have Ace Jack we can have Ace 10 we can have King Queen how does this range win the big game cut off the button doesn't have Aces doesn't have Jacks very much doesn't have tens very much doesn't have king queen off always doesn't have Ace Jack suited always doesn't have Ace Queen doesn't have Ace King so it doesn't it's not about who has the nutted hands it's about how often you have the nutted hands so I'll tell you right now the strategy for the cut off is to check 100% of the time there we go remember 94% check whose range is wider the cut offs range is wider so if we look here both players can to have king queen however if you look here the cut off has 43 combos of hands the button has 191 so we have 413 by 191 let's make it easier and just call it that the buttons range is half as wide so they're going to have a Jack twice as often they're going to have king queen twice as often they're going to have Jack 10 twice as often now sometimes they three bet pre flop and yes they don't have Aces Jacks and tens however they have a straight here 6.4% of the time and two pair 19.4% of the time 16% of the range is a straigh or two pair 16% let's add in top pair almost 35% of the range is top pair are better and you've added in something here you're out of the position right look at what's different about this chart where is the out of position's advantages here so before we saw the out of the pre flop razor was always ahead of the the um preflop collar but where is the advantage on this chart for the green out of position player so it's not Equity realization the out of position player just doesn't have any advantages at any part of the range because their range is wider and the buttons calling range is so tight everyone is is trained to C bet because they they play against the big blind and you get a c bet a lot against the big blind why you get a c bet a lot against the big blind because they have so much air in their range when someone Flats you that's not in one of the blinds their range is going to be pretty tight okay it's going to be tighter than your range therefore you're probably going to lose the small game every time when you're flatted by a player that's not the button or sorry not the blinds you're probably going to lose the small game okay so therefore we just check because we don't have any advantages you don't get a c bet it's not this like god-given right because you raise pre flop that you just get a bet the Flop like sure you can do it but it's a pretty strategy because you're just betting into a range that's stronger than yours so what happens then oh you check and now the button bets small why do they not bet big well because we can have king queen on the button as well you know we in the cut off we can have king queen we can have Ace Jack so we mostly just bet small why because we win the small game here we don't have any air they have more of the king8 off and stuff like that we can just attack uh A7 Deuce so what happens now um A7 Deuce same situation see if I have A7 Deuce good old classic two t so what happens on this flop who wins the small game on A7 Deuce cut off or the button here's the cut offs range right here before I click it you can see now here's the the the cutoffs range A7 Duce what's the small game here yeah we lose the small game in the cutoff why because we have Queen nine off Jack nine off 10 nine off Jack 10 off King 10 off look at all this big chunk of off suit hands it doesn't have anything to do with the aces okay has to do with this offit hands look at all all our offsuit hands that completely whiff on ace7 Deuce okay we have too much Broadway error who wins the big game on A7 Deuce who wins the big game does the cut off have more ax so a lot of people just think that the cut off has more Aces do they so let's look at it for two ways one yes the cut off can have ace5 A6 A7 A8 however the buttons range is twice as tight I don't know the correct way to say that but I think you guys understand what I'm saying it's has half as many combos I'll say that that sounds more elegant the buttons range has half as many combos so it doesn't matter that they don't have A7 off suit in the range because they have Ace Jack twice as often as you do so on A7 deuce the cut off's still going to check a lot and if they do bet they're only going to bet small okay so they check 80% of the time why well do you really want to go bet bet bet with Ace Queen cuz it's kind of hard to start blasting ax because look at this hand in the cut offs R the buttons range Ace Queen off oh Ace jack off they just they have all the strong Aces other than Ace King your only advantage on this flop your only advantage in terms of like is like Ace King it's your only like hand that you can have that the button can't have except look at this this is a disadvantage look at how little offsuit air they have versus we have all the offsuit nines I'm going to go back you see we have like King n like we have way more junk in our range so we just check a lot and we only bet small because the only hand that wants to bet big is Ace King we're not going to build the range about one hand so we end up checking a lot and now these over pairs oh they're kind of now uh let's change it to like a nine High flop let's go to let's see what nine High flops I have so now we should get some big bets so now you see oh here's bet 75 why well we have this Advantage around tens Jacks Queens Kings and Aces oh and then what happened here on the 9x does the button have nine nine High hands King n Queen n Jack n 109 no do we yeah these are pretty good hands now with Jack n's a pretty strong hand now because we're not worried about pocket 10's Jacks Queen Kings or Aces and we only like they can have Ace 9 but so now all of these like and like a pair of sixes like our suited sixes are doing better because we're only worried about a nine and they don't have a nine very often we're not worried about over pairs so now we get to start betting big again and betting more often because all these nine High hands hit Jack 10 has a lot more Equity now because has straight draws same with Queen 10 what if I change this to eight High board 84 Douce rainbow what happened now we have a lot more air again and we're probably betting really big when we bet so now again here's an eight High board we check a lot because we have a lot of air with these nine High hands and King Jacks we still have a lot of air and we start over betting what hands do we over overb with are over pairs in ace8 and king8 because both players have a lot of air and we win the big game with our over pair you want to bet pocket Queens sure go for it bet 125% of the pot just don't bet 25% of the pot here you're not getting enough money into the pot with your advantages here you're making a lot of money with Jack n off here betting 125% of the pot because what happens you bet 125 and they call with a pair of eights or pocket sevens and then the turn to Jack what do you got to do now you just got to keep betting with your jack n for Value cuz they don't have King Jack Queen Jack anymore cuz they folded those on the Flop let's talk about the turn so we're going back to I'm sorry I know we're jumping around so we're going back to button versus big blind 40 big Blends because this is the easiest way to explain this okay so we're going to make this again Ace do Ace 10 4 rainbow okay Ace 104 rainbow so we've already kind of explained hopefully you know watch our strategy here we're going to bet everything and we're going to bet small because we're attacking the so we bet two things happen here we bet 100% of our range right and then the big blind calls okay something happened here what happened once the big blind called Big blind's Range narrowed what happened to the Big blind's Air what happened to the big blind's air it folded it's gone what happened to the big blind's best hands like Ace 10 ace four pocket fours they're gone they three they check rais the Flop so their best hands are gone their worst hands are gone what is the big blind left with the middle weaker Pair of Aces weaker top pair lots of 10x lots of pair of fours lots of king queen king Jack Queen Jack um and then there's like the speculative hands like Queen n suited Jack n suited jack8 suited Queen 8 Suited king8 suited like these back door King High flush draws and then some of these wheel straight draws okay what happens to our range what happened to our what happened to our air we still have our air what happened to our strong hands we have all the strong hands as well we bet everything we can have the strong hands and we can have the hands so when they bet they Boughton bets big blind calls and I'm going to put up a complete brick the eight of Hearts okay the big blind's going to check we already know that what is going to be the most common sizing for the big the button once the the big blind checks here is it going to be and I'll tell you the options here it's 30% 65% 100% or 150% and the pot is 160 and we're playing about 588 behind Okay so who wins the small game now most people are seem to get that the the button does not want to bet small who wins the small game the big blind wins the small blind the the the big blind wins the small blind because they don't have any air their worst hands are like king queen queen Jack King Jack king8 suited Queen Queen n suited our worst hands are like what what could we have here Queen Deuce Jack 3 we have a lot of 10 104 is a good hand 95 we have a lot of trash here Deuces okay so I can tell you here the most common bet size is probably going to be like 160 and it's probably going to be the only size of chosen why cuz 240 is too big because we're under a 4 4 to1 spr so 4:1 would be 640 and we have 160 left if this was 640 we'd bet 100% of the pot which would be 160 they call the pot would be 480 and we'd have 480 left that'd be completely geometric so guessing here it's probably just going to be 160 you can see that is the most common sizing here okay now we check a lot now we're checking half our range why well because we don't want to bet a pair of tens because they have a pair of 10 the only tens we're be betting are 108 104 pocket 10 ignore this like Queen 10 off like betting half I don't know why the hell we're doing that because King 10's not betting and Jack 10's not betting so just ignore ignore stuff like this when you're looking at a solver cuz none of us know or like I could look into it and figure it out but not going to so this is where you start to see more polarization because we lose the small game we lose the small game and we win the big game what's the big game here Ace King Ace Queen Ace Jack Ace 10 Ace 9 A8 now you can see here Ace du A3 H4 H5 and A6 sometimes bet but the reason they don't want to bet and the reason A7 and ace9 always bet let's focus on A9 is because they don't have a hand better than ace9 they check raise a jack on the Flop and then a8's two pair so we bet like a A9 are better yeah the big game hand class here is like top pair kicker good kicker yeah we bet like ace9 are better here's 108 here's pocket eights here's pocket fours and then we bet Bluffs what Bluffs are we betting like we bet some really trashy like king deuce Queen Deuce this is a whole another lecture why do we bet Queen 3 more than we bet King Jack most people Bluff with King Jack here this is like always the case you want to Bluff Queen 3 um it's a little bit to do with blockers but not exactly the short answer is King Jack can still beat all their Queen Jacks and queen n suited Queen 3 does not beat those hands uh King Jack also dominates Queen Jack Queen three can get them to fold out all their gut shots so what happens here is we bet oh what do you know they start folding a pair of tens they call With A Pair of Aces they fold all this other stuff so now like they're left with like some pair of tens a lot of pair of acases you call let's say the river's a deuce we check there going to be no small betting it's only going to be big and we just beat the we bet the hands that beat the middle parts of their range that have enough equity and like we bet the big game we we win the big game as a general rule the caller of the previous Street normally wins the small game the better normally wins the big game why because the better has to bet Bluffs and they bet good hands too the caller tends to fold their bad hands and raise their good hands so this is really important this small Bame big game is really important on turns and rivers okay what happens now let's say we bet like what happens a lot here we bet 30 they call eight of Hearts comes check check do the clubs so when check check now on the turn who wins the small game the big blind does the big blind still wins the small game because the button can still have whatever random trash they bet on the Flop what happened in the big game though the big game now the big blind caught up let's make this like U three of Hearts the big blind wins kind of both games now they win the small game for sure but they also win the big game because now they have like A7 more than the button does they have 108 more they have um ace8 more they have ace3 more like because the button doesn't have as many big hands because they checked back so the value of a 10 went way up because the big blind the button didn't bet so they're less likely to have an ace so now you get into some River you know block betting games because they don't have much air so you see here they're checking they're betting a lot um all right I know this is like bet sizing is a topic that you can't really um you know you really can't cover it in one hour um and we didn't really get to specific hand examples I was just kind of using specific flops that I knew the bet sizings would be the way they are that I think people missplay in terms of this whole big game small game type of Mind Set and with betting this is helpful did you guys like this you know all right um I am glad you guys enjoyed um thank you very much awesome thanks guys", metadata={'source': 'DFbmngKCQbU', 'title': 'How To Pick The PERFECT Bet Size In Poker!',

[Document(page_content="all right everyone so I thought that we would do a hand review of season 9 episode 4 of Poker Knight in America I chose to go over this one for a few reasons one I did Host this season uh if you haven't seen the episodes you can watch all of them on poker Knight America YouTube channel but I thought it would be fun to go over this session uh because again I did host it and I got to see all of the hands and this was a crazy crazy game with a really fun action lineup um and uh so they're playing 2550 lots of straddles happening in this game and uh this is a fun one to go over because we got a good lineup like I said including Jonathan little shout out uh Mike daliy Joey D Pascal Matt glance Ethan Yao AKA Rampage um and sha Dee so they're playing six-handed so ranges are wider action is crazier and they're pretty deep here if you can see they had already been playing for um a little bit already so this isn't the beginning of the session so that's why the stack sizes are kind of all over the place but as you can see uh Rampage has 75,000 in front sha Dee is sitting with 65k so he's up 20K um and uh yeah Jonathan little ran is has been running super super bad this session uh but playing really really solid so I thought it'd be fun to kind of go over some of these hands so so let's uh let's check out the first uh the firstand and and get into the action here so as you can see there's already a straddle on this hand so it's 2550 100 right now oh no this is a double straddle 2550 1002 that 200 straddle is coming from Shawn deeb and remember any time there is a uh straddle and double straddle it makes the effective stock shorter so you're actually not as deep as you think um so okay so here we have a raise from Joey D with pocket stickes um Joey is it looks like he is on the button and Matt glance gives it a call and Jonathan little puts in a really cool three bet squeeze here to uh 3000 with the king queen off I really like three betting this hand because it has good removal um you're blocking a lot of your opponent's uh calling range and for Bing range so he's blocking hands like pocket kings pocket Queens Ace king king um pck uh Ace Queen uh so he's he's blocking the the snap calls and he's also blocking their for betting hands um plus it's just not a great hand to flat out of position on Joey um it just it's it's a hand that doesn't play as well post flop out of position so I like turning king queen hands like king queen king Jack ajck into uh three bet Bluffs here so he raises to 3,000 I like this sizing and uh Joey gives it a call and they're going to be heads up so the Flop is 1042 rainbow so this is a board that is going to be hard for um both players to connect with but they are going to have like you know the overp pairs and uh you know set set of tens here um but this is such a dry board that Jonathan should be continuation betting at a very high frequency anytime the board is dry and disconnected you're going to be seab betting at a high frequency um when so basically bet sizing is a and and you're going to choose a smaller sizing bet sizing is a function of frequency so the more often you do something the smaller size you're going to go so for example on this board this is a dry board we're going to seat at a high frequency so I like choosing a small sizing um I'm not sure what Jonathan goes if he is deciding that this is like a oneandone seab then I could see Merit for sizing up a little bit uh so there's just under 7,000 in the pot and he goes 2,000 so I or 2500 so I actually like this this is about a third pot okay little under a third and Joey has a tough decision and he actually puts in a raise here and this is a really gutsy raise in my opinion but I also kind of like it because like if you think about it pocket sixes is a hand that requires a lot of protection and it also I mean it very well could be good on this board because as like I said Jonathan should be seab betting at a high frequency here so jonath all of Jonathan's Bluffs are going to continue betting here like the king queen so if Jonathan see bets every time and Joey knows that then putting in a raise here is actually kind of good because it's putting maximum pressure on Jonathan um and it's not a great hand because if he flats and Jonathan bets again almost every turn card other than a six and a like a five is bad for you and a three so um it's bad it's bad for pocket sixes so the hand requires protection it's not very easy to play on a lot of turns so um and it could very well be the best hand right now so better to kind of like put in AR raise and uh you know try to end the action here on the Flop um so obviously Jonathan can't call here so he lets it go but I really like how Jonathan played this one so let's check out the next s all right so 25 50 100 straddle and Rampage has pocket kings he raises to 300 and deep has pocket 10 Deep was on fire this session he literally couldn't lose so he gives it a call I like just calling here especially against an under the gun open you're just facing a pretty tight range if Dee had decided a three bet and Rampage four bet which he probably would have because he had 10 Kings uh Sean would be in a tough spot so I like just flatting the tens there to avoid that so Queen 74 rainbow flop and Ethan continues for 500 I definitely don't see deeb going anywhere here he has um second pair dry texture again Ethan should probably be seting this dry board at a high frequency four of Hearts now on the turn de checks and Ethan is going to bet again I like betting here especially I love having overp pairs um on a like a queen High Jack High board like kings and Aces is really good because uh deep could definitely have a lot of Queen X I mean he does block king queen but deep could have a Queen suited Queen Jack suited things like that and like pocket Jacks pocket 10 pocket NES is going to have a hard time folding here so on once especially once the board pairs so de makes another call and five of clubs on the river I imagine deep is just going to check to the aggressor and I would imagine for uh his 11 big blinds 12 big Ace queen queen Jack maybe even make a loose call here with pocket tens I don't really think Ethan has anything to worry about Dee shouldn't have like hardly any fours in his range I mean I guess e i I guess deep could have like ace4 suited four five suited but four five might have check raised the turn so Ethan is betting 6,500 here and Dee has a decision to make Dee probably going through all the the combinations of hands that beats him um he does make the call and I can I can understand de's call here because Ethan is a very good player and applies a lot of pressure um and Ethan can definitely represent like the strong Queens as well like top set of Queens Ace Queen things like that um so I think that it's a it's an understandable call on Dee's end so commercial commercial now we're back with it okay so it looks like there is a $100 straddle this game might as well have just been oh it's it's okay so it's a straddle double straddle triple straddle here so they're playing 2550 100 200 400 Dental with the Ace King of Diamonds poor Dental he just got crushed this session he raises to 11,00 again since effective Stacks are shorter it's okay to size your pre- flop bets down so you could Min R you can go 1100 here uh sha deep here with the ace four off is going to defend his straddle here and they're going to be heads up 3532 clubs uh both players Miss but deeb does have that gutshot and the four clubs blocker dentali has the two over so he could uh hit his overcards he's going to be SE betting here um if de doesn't have a pair or a hand like this with a gut shot it's hard for him to continue so if he had like Queen Jack suited he's just going to have to fold every time de now with the best hand hitting the four check check good check there by Dental Queen of Spades on the river uh dentali checking back thinking he has Showdown value which is very uh reasonable because I think hands especially unblocking clubs I think Deep's going to have floats like king queen with the King of Clubs or something or or you know just some random hands like ace high um so I like I like Den's check back it's definitely it definitely wouldn't be a value bet if he bet the river so because it's too hard to get called from worse like he's never getting called by Ace Jack there okay TR qu triple straddle on again uh oh no now there's an 800 straddle so they're just kind of playing bingo here okay so John is all in for uh with Ace 10 off so notice that he's all in for 8,000 um which might sound like a lot to you guys but remember with an 800 straddle it's an it's only a 10 big blind shove so this is completely standard sha D with the pocket fours is he gonna call for 10 big blinds I don't see him folding because he's sha deep and then's gonna let the queen four Spades go I imagine D Pascal with the 10 threes folding obviously and they're going to see Heads Up all In uh run outs don't really matter I could fast forward this but I'm not going to spoil it for you guys or I'm not gonna I'm not going to take that away from you guys I'm going to let you see even though the runout at this point doesn't matter and that's kind of a lesson that I want you guys to understand too um actually I'm going to pause this for a sec so that I can oh yeah of course oh good so John hits his top pair good I'm like rooting for JL here okay um only because I like Shan D too but he's won a lot so good uh double there for Jonathan little um the point I was going to make with it's it doesn't matter watching the run out is poker is such an emotional game that there's once the chips are all in there's no reason for you to you know get upset if you lose or get happy if you win because once the chips are in the only thing that should manner is did you play the hand correctly and especially when it's a flip there you don't want anything to affect your emotional state at the poker game so and that goes for being happy too like you know when you get tilted you might or if you lose a hand you might get tilted and then you might play poorly right like you might play more hands I think we're all guilty of that um but then when you win and you get happy at the poker table that's not really doing you any good either because you know it's still affecting your emotions you might play more hands because you might have happy tilt happy tilt is definitely a thing so once the chips are all in the middle you know try to just focus on did you play the hand correctly instead of what's the run out going to be um when I used to play full-time online I used to 24 table uh so I would I would play 24 tables at once and I would be all in on like five tables at one time you know for example and I wouldn't watch any of the runouts I would literally just focus on the other tables and not even watch because and and I also used to not check my uh you know how I was doing like how much I was up or down in the middle of a session like it's always good to to at least have 100 big blinds and know like that you are you know at least play 100 bigs effective or or 150 or 200 bigs effective when you do play um but there's no point of counting your stack after every hand this is so important and I see so many people make this mistake is after every single hand they're counting how much they're up or how much they're down and and that little thing it's just a negative you know mental thing that you don't need so try really hard not to check your account balance in the middle of a session or not to count your chips after every hand just you know just try to wait till the end of the session because poker is one long session and you don't play it Hand by hand that would literally drive you nuts um so that's just my little uh Spiel on that anyway okay so 18K pot there for JL okay Ace Queen off or Ace Queen off for glance there's a 400 straddle on and he is all in for uh his 11 big blinds 12 big blinds yeah so at this point with the straddles it's like this is just like all in her fold it's really important to make those important to make those adjustments when there are straddles on if there's just one straddle then you're just going to um divide your stack by two basically basically all right Joey is deciding to gamble or is he does he let it go he's thinking he's G to gamble you don't come to Poker Knight in America not to gamble all right guys let me know on social media if you want me like on Twitter or something tag me let me know if you want me to make a course on or a lesson on how to play on a on a high stakes live game I don't know if that's something you guys want to learn um but if it is let me know and I will definitely do that because it does kind of require a little bit of a different strategy all right so fast forward fast forward all right okay 400 straddle is on Sean Dee is is the is Raising it up to 1,200 here in the looks like the big blind D Pascal is defending his stradle with the ace 10 suited and glance has Ace 10 off suit and is making the call as well I have a weird feeling de's going to win this one okay yep so uh Matt glance with the nut flush draw he has the ace of diamonds there um but de does have middle pair which is currently the best hand so he SE bets um this is a hand whenever you have middle pair it's fine to go into check call mode uh we would call this a Class C or if if there wasn't a flush dra on the board you know it would be considered a classy it's still considered a classy middling hand um but with all the diamonds out there I think that it he should be betting here to get value from random diamonds like glance is definitely going to be calling with Ace of Diamonds here you want to charge your opponents uh for their draws um so you want to uh you don't want to just give them a free card and let a fourth Diamond Roll uh if you think you have the best hand on the Flop or if it's you know certainly possible you can have the best hand on the Flop then you should just be trying to take down monoto boards with a seab bet okay so glance does make the call like we thought and hits his [Music] Diamond I imagine deeb should be slowing down this is definitely I think time to check here okay never mind he's going to go for another but I guess it could go either way if once he checks it's it's basically telling your opponent that he can never have a good flush because I think he's going to be Bing all of his ace high King High diamonds um so I don't know I I I could see it going either way now Sean has picked up enough Showdown value that I think that he should be checking um but it just really looks like glance has a diamond because I don't think he can call any turn that's not a diamond of course glance is going to go for value now now the question is sizing so there's 97 in the pot I I was going to say I would hope to see him go a small sizing here because it's with four diamonds out there and full houses out there it's really hard to get um value from worse diamonds so a small bet look you know is going to get that thinner value those looser calls from maybe queen of diamonds or King of Diamonds um so maybe I would have even gone a little bit smaller all right okay so here Ethan ya so there's a so steb Is straddling to 400 Ethan Yao with the ace Queen off is going to raise it up to 1,400 and sha deep with the King five suited here so he calls I also think you could three bet this hand um but with the straddle on I think I prefer a call um only because again effective Stacks are shorter so you don't have as much playability and you definitely don't want to like have to price yourself in if you flop a five post flop so Ethan here with the Ace of clubs back door flesh draw and de with with the stone cold nothing would probably just fold just I I would probably just check fold here okay so five of spa or five of hearts on the turn okay I see what happened so Ethan checked the Flop Dee bet the turn and Ethan called so Ethan went into check call mode I understand okay so de uh once Ethan checks the Flop I think Dee is like all right I have no Showdown value here there's the only way that I'm ever going to win this pot is if I try and take it down with a bed on the Flop here um so that's what he decides to do um so now deeb has picked up a pair of fives and he's betting again he's betting 3500 and I know a lot of you are probably wondering why Shawn is deciding to bet here now now that he's picked up um Showdown value and I think that his reasoning is probably he's turning his pair into a bluff um he wants to be able to you know say that he has a tent or a set or two pair or something so I don't think that he's considering um his five like the winning hand here plus you know it it could be a very thin value bet because he could be getting value from Ethan's draws and one when Shawn doesn't have any of the blockers to the draw so he's not blocking like any nines any Jacks any Spades or anything like that um he's blocking King Jack I guess but other than that uh I think that it looks like Ethan could have a lot of draws so maybe he's like this is kind of like a semi Bluff where he could have the best hand trying to you know get those draws to fold and you know also possibly um trying to get like hands like an eight or for a week king or a week 10 to fold as well or hand like pocket sevens nines all those hands that beat him okay so Ethan makes the call again interesting okay so King of Diamonds On The River giving Shawn two pair now I definitely think that this should be a value bet um I'm pretty certain Sean believes he has the best hands so now the question is sizing I think he wants to go big yeah I was going to say he should be going big here to polarize so when Shawn goes so big it look since all of the draws bricked the club draws the straight draws since all those hands bricked Sean betting so big uh might get get looser calls from Ethan because uh like I said it could look like Sean uh bricked all of the draws here so Ethan makes a super loose call I respect it so much I do think it's going to work uh at a high frequency Sean just happened to have it there yeah um I think this hand was played well by both parties okay so okay so $400 straddle is on and Telly has pocket Jacks here and he shoves all in for 6600 I like this again what is that like 15 bigs 16 bigs something like that and let's see if he gets any action Yao with the ace 10 off suit I would probably fold here especially with deeb on his left uh I think it's just a little bit all right so he calls I mean okay I kind of take it back it if it was a tournament I'd say I would probably fold the ace 10 there um but in a cash game when they're going so crazy I think that uh calling for this amount is okay I might just fold I think it's a close spot and let's see if he can if dentali can hold nope not a good so that's he's drawing pretty thin there okay poor d t like I said he ran pretty bad this session all right it looks like this is the end of the session here um let's take a look at the chip counts to see who did what all right so Dental lost 14,000 Joey D ran really well at uh he won 30k

[Document(page_content="today I'm going to give you 10 gigantic incredibly important mandatory tips that you must fully understand if you want to have success at Cash games let's get right to it tip number one is to stop open limping if you open limp on a regular basis in cash games especially if they take a rake out of each pot you will lose okay simple as that an open limp just to be clear is whenever you are the first person to voluntarily put money in the pot so if they Guild the cards small blinds in there big blinds in there you're under the gun you're first to act if you match the big blind you're going to lose a poker okay stop doing that understand that many of your opponents are going going to do exactly that and that is why they are stuck at the small or medium Stakes games you simply cannot allow all the other players to see the flop for only one big blind they're not making a mistake they should call one big B blind very often at that point and play in position against you with anything decent also you let the big blind see the flop for free say they have the Jack four off suit if you raise they have to fold if you limp sometimes they make three of a kind or Jack high and that's good enough and that's not what you want to have happen so you need to raise also whenever you L you induce people behind you to raise because they're going to think that you have a somewhat weak range and if they think you have a somewhat weak range because they presume you would have raised with your best stands well they're going to raise you now you have to play out of position in a slightly larger pod than you would like to be in with what's probably not a very good hand also like I said by limping assuming everyone limps behind the casino is going to take a rake out of the pot you do not want to pay rake to the casino rake is not your friend less rake is better not more so make sure you do not limp instead simply raise whenever you're first to act in a live cash game and you want to raise raise is something like three or four big blinds I do not care if the standard raise in your game is to something like seven big blinds don't play poorly do not model your strategy after bad poker players who cannot move up from the small Sak games okay you need to model your strategy after good strong winning poker players and no good strong winning poker players open raising to seven big blinds before the Flop so raise first in tip number two is to raise with reasonable ranges players play nowhere near reasonable ranges at all so let me show you what I have right here we have two different sets of ranges we're going to go through a few positions in this scenario here we have under the gun ranges this is when you are first to act at an e-hand table okay in this chart the hands in red are raising the hands in blue are folding over here hands in red are raising hands in white are folding the chart on this side with blue is a cash game chart with rake and these charts do presume that everyone plays well the chart on the right is actually for a tournament where there is no rake taken out of each pot and there is an anti in play which allows you to play wider ranges because the pot will be bigger if you raise when someone calls because there was an anti in play and no rake is taken out in the pot so this is the game theory optimal range if everyone plays perfectly now look your opponents will not play perfectly your opponents are going to make all sorts of mistakes so for that reason you can actually raise a little bit wider than this but notice like pocket twos is not raising ace10 off suit's not raising 107 suit is not raising they're nowhere near raising and what a lot of people do very incorrectly is they think all right I'm going to mix it up I have the 107 suited or the Jack four off suit I'm going to mix it up and try to make my opponents confused but no no no no no make them confused when you have the King five suited or the king jack off suit or the 65 suited you have way better spots to get quote unquote out of L right and the reason I showed you the tournament charts here is that this is about as Loose as you can possibly raise now this chart does presume the opponents play well but it also presumes the pot is going to be bigger than it actually is in your specific games but you really can't get away with raising much wider than this range if you told me you wanted to raise this range in a live cash game where everybody's making mistakes left and right fine I don't have a problem with it but don't get much looser than this from under the gun if you're on the button you get to play many more hands as you are in a better position you get to raise wider and wider and wider right because there are fewer players get to act who can randomly wake up with a hand to be clear these charts are formed when everyone folds to you if people limp in front of you or raise in front of you you're need to use different charts we have different charts available at pokercoaching.com in our app and on the website go check that out as you see though in a cash can you can raise with about 41% of hands assuming the blind's play perfectly which they will not see get is a little bit wider and in a tournament with again no rake and an an you get to play 55% of hands a whole lot more like 15% more hands which is a lot so again this is about as wide as you can reasonably raised unless the players in the blinds are very tight and very passive so keep that in mind tip number three is to three bet often from the small blind paying the rake is really really really really really really really bad consider what happens if someone raids us from let's say the button you call from the small blind and the big blindfolds say they made it three big blinds before the Flop the pot would normally be seven big blinds in a cash game but a lot of casinos will take one big blind out of the pot which is like 133% of the pot or something like that my math may be wrong forgive me so do you want to give away 13ish perent of the pot from out of position even 10% of the pot which is like the minimum a lot of casinos take the answer is definitely not also a lot of casinos take money out for a bad beat jackpot which No Limit holding players don't hit all that often anyway so this is really really bad for you if they're taking 15 or 20% of the pot there is no way in the world you can win with all sorts of random stuff so to account for this you need to be reising three betting same word or Bolding with every hand you plan to play here is the GTO small blind strategy against an under thee gun raise and you see you're really only fre betting just the absolute best hands plus a few s connected Bluffs I know it seems tight and you can probably raise a little bit wider than this or Rea a little bit wider than this but again you can't get too insane you can't be re raising the ace9 off suit or the queen n suited or the pocket twos it's not a good strategy when to make it crystal clear here there is no calling range because when you call you have a bad relative position because when you call the big blind's going to call a lot on the Flop you're going to check the big blind's going to check the initial raisers are going to bet then you have to figure out what you're going to do before the big blind announces if they have a good hand or not so that's bad and you're out of position against a strong range so all of that forces you to be very very tight over here we have the small blind three betting strategy against the button now you do get to three bet substantially wider because the button is Raising wider remember we're presuming the button's raising with this range here which is pretty wide right so that allows you to three bet much wider yourself but again you're not going nuts you're not three betting every suited Ace you're not three betting Ace n off suit or pocket threes or 87 suited these hands just go right into the muck none of your opponents are going to do this they're going to play far too loose and you know what they're all going to lose if you make regular consistent blunders like a lot of your opponent will do in small and medium six games you're going to get crushed tip number four three bet often versus arrays again many players do not three betat often enough here we have a few charts I know that it's a little bit small on your end here we have a lowjack strategy which would be under the gun if we were playing six-handed versus a raise from under the gun e-hand here we have the hijack which is the position to the left of the lowjack versus a lowjack raise and here we have button versus a cut raise so you see these ranges get looser because the initial razor and the uh player yet to act are loose are in later positions as we go this way so let's take a look at lowjack versus Under the Gun notice not a whole lot of calling the hands that are calling are actually all really good and for that reason this is a spot where you got to play super tight because again under the gun should have a very strong range but also there are a lot of players yet to act who could easily wake up with a strong hand and put you in a miserable spot by three betting right you don't really want to call with Jack n Suited get three bet by somebody yet to act or four bet by the initial razor then you just have to fold immediately right so we see a pretty good amount of three betting most players do not three bet the king 10 suited the ace for suited the ace eight suited the king queen suited most people call or three bet king queen off suit Ace Shack off suit Etc and that's just a mistake here we have highjack versus a lowjack raise a pretty similar range because assuming your opponents are playing relatively tight strategies because they should if there's a rake in the cash game this is a spot where they they just can't get out of line and if they can't get out of line you in turn can't get out of line now look again you may want to play a little bit looser if your opponents are not going to format enough or if they're raising too wide but you can't get too crazy maybe you three bet a little bit more than this or maybe you call a little bit more than this but not much more here we have about as Loose as you should be button versus a cut off raise notice again lots of three betting with a polarized range meaning you're three betting with your best hands some suited Aces some suited Kings a few suited connectors and some off suit High cards that you don't really want to call like Ace 10 off suit and the calling range is entirely hands to flop pretty well some suited Aces good suited Broadway hand some suit connectors some Pairs and some very good high cards you don't want to three betat and then get four bet with like Ace Queen you don't really want to three bet Ace Queen and then get four betat but in most games if you'll find that all of your opponents are three betting the ace queen off suit every single time they think it's the nuts they three bet it they get forb bet and they don't know what to do and then they lose a ton of money and that's one more reason why they lose tip number five we're talking about post flop now consider range and nut Advantage each flop will favor one player or the other and if you have the range Advantage you should be betting more often so what is the range advantage that means that if you took your entire range whatever that was before the Flop and you ran that in a equity calculator against your opponent's entire range one player is going to have more Equity than the other we'll go through this in just a second next one player will have the nut Advantage more than the others meaning they just have far more super strong hands that can put the money in if you have the range Advantage you're going to find that you should usually bet very often sometimes 100% of the time and if you have more nut hands you should usually use larger bet sizes because when you have a lot of strong hands in your range you typically want to put money in the pot so let's consider what happens when you raise from the lowjack and the big blind calls that's it you raise the lowjack the big blind BL calls may ask what is in my hand you have your entire rage at this point we don't know what your hand is it doesn't even matter so you raise lowjack big blind calls flop comes Ace Jack n just think about this logically if low Jack is Raising with a very strong prep flop raising range they're going to have pocket aces pocket Jacks pocket NES Ace Jack Ace nine suited Ace King Ace Queen Etc right they have a lot of really good hands but if the big blind which we haven't even discussed here make sure you check out pokercoaching.com in the charts there where we discuss that thoroughly if they're going to be three betting hands like Ace King Ace Queen pocket Jacks pocket aces Etc they don't have those hands this is a spot where the initial Razer has a big range advantage and a big nut Advantage which is going to lead to very frequent betting probably 100% of the time and also some large bets in this spot consider 633 this is another scenario where the initial razor will have a big range Advantage because they have all the overpays and the big BLS have all sorts of trash on 633 so so that means the initial razor can bet very frequently however on 633 the initial razor has almost no threes in their range at all so even though they have the range Advantage they lack the nut advantage and that results in the initial razor betting very frequently perhaps 100% of the time but using a small size okay and a small size is like one big blind or two big blinds may sound crazy but that is good strong poker consider 875 with a flush draw this is a spot where now the initial razor should not be betting very often because the initial razor does not have a whole lot of hands that connect all that well with this board they don't have the 96 suited they may not have the 87 suited if they're playing nitty and I mean they just don't have a lot of good hands here right so this is a board where the big blind is going to have not necessarily A an advantage but it's way closer to 50/50 right when it's closer to 5050 that forces the initial razor to continuation bet far less often you know what while we're talking about this I actually wrote a book it just came out it's called 100 essential tips to master no limit hold them we're going through 10 today not necessarily from this book but look this book explains all sorts of things you must Master for example properly combat limpers most people combat limpers incorrectly what else do we have consider who has the net Advantage we literally just talked about that who was H in this office can you imagine me sitting in this office grinding all day every day for you bet when check do on the turn most people check far too weak over fold against most players aggression on the river oh my God we're about to talk about that in just a second anyway you can check out this book If you like this video if you're enjoying this if you like my content you're going to love this book we'll put links below you can get it on Amazon or D&B poker or lots of other places tip number six is to stop slow playing understand that you want to play Big pots with your best stands and small and mediumsized pots with everything else whenever you have a big Edge you want to get a lot of money in the pot you don't have a big Edge you don't really want to get a lot of money in the pot unless you have a good logical bluffing hand so when you have one of your best hands try to get money in the pot as the pre- Flop aggressor if you raise pre- floing somebody called and you flop a really good hand if they check bet and perhaps exploitatively use a larger size than normal not a humongous size but you know if you know that sometimes you want a bet pot that pot will your best stands even though it may not be the game theory optimal strategy whenever you are the pre-f Flop caller facing a bat say the cut off raises and you call on the button and you flop a good hand if they bet the Flop raise if you're in the big blind you check the Flop they bet raise put money in the pot with your best hands please the only time slow playing may make some sense is when all of the following are true first the boy board is extremely uncoordinated that's going to be a flop like Jack 62 pretty uncoordinated board next when your opponent can make many hands or can have many hands that could improve to the second best hand on the next card on Jack six2 your opponent could easily have a hand like Ace King Ace queen king queen that can make top pair spot where you know if you can beat those hands that's a good scenario to slow play a time you do not want to slow play is when the hands of your opponent can reasonably improve to beat you give an example say you raise Ace King before the Flop and the big blind calls the Flop comes whatever Ace something something if they check and you check it back what is going to improve that will also want to put in a ton of money on Ace 92 well it's going to be the straight draws like 54 53 43 if they improve you lose it's going to be pocket sixes when it spikes a six it's going to be 98 when it turns trips are two pair but it's not going to be handl like Queen Jack that makes a random Jack right that's a really bad spot to slow play next you also want to keep slow playing or you want to you want to be cons consider slow playing when your opponent will keep betting on many turs if you think your opponent's just going to blast a turn very frequently because that's how they operate it's a pretty good spot to slow play finally you want to slow play when you block many of the hands that are of high value that your opponent could have usually this is going to be when you have top set top three of a kind in particular because when you do have that hand it's really hard for your opponent to have anything consider on Jack 62 and if you have pocket Jacks it's really hard for your opponent to have anything that could potenti put a lot of money in the pot right and if they do have three of a kind like say they have pocket twos on Jack 62 you're going to play a big pot anyway right so that's a spot where maybe it makes sense to slow play long story short top set on uncoordinated board sure feel free to slow play anything else don't slow playay bet and get money in the pot tip number seven is to play cautiously in multi-way pots I cannot tell you how many times I have seen players flop top pair in a multi-way pot 100 big blinds deep then just plow their money in because top pair even with top kicker normally pretty good but not what you're playing against six other people and three of them want to put all their money in the pot you are going to be dead when a lot of players see the Flop someone is likely to have something and that becomes more and more and more true as more and more players see the Flop if it is not you well it's probably someone else this forces you to play extremely cautiously in multi-way pots across the board so from out of position you have to do a lot of checking very often you have to check every single hand in your rate as a general rule if the Flop comes three cards 10 or lower that are kind of connected and you were an early position Razer and a bunch of people called you you should be checking everything because that board should completely hit all of your opponent's ranges also you just don't need to Bluff all that often with low Equity hands in multi-way pots if you have just two overcards in a multi-way pot you probably don't want to be bluffing it whereas in a heads up pot sure go ahead and bet right so from out of position you have to do a lot of checking the only time you really get to be kind of aggressive in multi-weight pots as the initial better on the Flop is when everyone checks to you and you have a hand that's probably good but vulnerable there you should be betting very frequently this is going to be with hands like top pair or maybe even under pair like say someone raises someone calls someone calls you call with pocket Apes on the button and the Flop comes 963 and they all check to you this is a spot where making a bet is usually fine when you do bet in multi-way P usually want to use a relatively small size because you do not have much of a nut Advantage because no one can have much of a nut Advantage remember how we discussed that earlier if you have a big nut Advantage you bet big in general but no one really has a nut Advantage because all of your ranges are all on top of each other so be very very careful in multi-weight pots don't stack off too lightly tip number eight is to exploitatively overfolded getting stacked they do not want to lose all of their money so many people come to me and they are distraught that they lost just like a super standard setup hand in my mind like oh can I have found a fold or oh did I have to Bluff it off but look you're going to get sacked sometimes get used to it anyway most people hate getting sacked so because of that when most players want to put all their money in the pot they usually have a pretty good hand usually a very good hand also most players hate getting caught Bluff getting caught bluffing because it makes them feel stupid if some people feel bad whatever they Bluff with nothing they get called and they either have to mck or they have to show their blo either one they don't like it in reality you should be proud of your BLS table them confidently every once in a while they'll give you the pot you'd be shocked so because of this because most people hate getting caught bluffing almost no no one Bluffs often enough so people usually are very value heavy with really good hands when they're betting big on the river and they don't Bluff enough so these things combined to mean you should exploitatively overfolded the marginal kicker and someone bet the Flop and Bets the turn and Bets the river and they're kind of tight and kind of straightforward old you're done get out of the hand it is okay realize that that line does not happen where it goes bet bet big bet all that often now if you're opponent is a loose aggressive insane Maniac then sure maybe because they finding hero calls but if your opponent's kind of tight kind of cautious kind of straightforward hold a lot hold a lot folding is not fun I realize that I hate folding but uh sometimes you got to do it step number nine is to keep a proper make roll you will inevitably have large upswings and large down swings you have to recognize this accept this and plan ahead even if you have a huge win rate you should keep at least 3,000 big blinds in your bank roll say you're playing one two No Limit $2 times 3,000 is $6,000 yeah you need about $6,000 to play one to No Limit and if you want to be cautious you should keep a whole lot more like 7,500 or maybe even more if you're playing tough online games against decently strong players and you're winning three big blinds per 100 hands you're going to need a ton of big blinds because you're going to inevitably have big big swings especially as your Edge gets smaller and smaller and unfortunately for you if you're playing small Sak Games The Rake and most games is kind of big and because of that having a large Edge is not actually all that reasonable maybe at one two you can win at most $15 per hour or $10 per hour if that's the case you are going to need a decent amount of big blinds because your down swings are going to be Savage and tip number 10 is to stay sane like I just said you will have large upswings and down swings get used to it accept it understand it don't let it bother you don't get too happy when you win a bunch of money CU sometimes you will don't get too sad when you lose a bunch of money because sometimes you will these are standard things that will happen coaching a student right now and he just went on a massive upswing he won like 60,000 bucks in one month from cash games in tournaments and then he promptly lost about $6,000 playing cash games over a weekend and he was distra how could this possibly happen he was happy when he won he's sad when he lost he's going through all the mental swings he's playing poorly when he's losing he's probably playing fine when he's winning or maybe he's just getting lucky who knows and you got to grow up you have to realize this stuff is normal understand that real poker is not a YouTube video blog where we're trying
