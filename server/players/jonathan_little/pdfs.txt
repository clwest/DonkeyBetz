 'INTRODUCTION by Jonathan Little I am fortunate in that I get to travel the '
 'world to high stakes poker tournaments on a regular basis Through my travels '
 'I have become friends with many of the best players in the game One day '
 'while I was discussing poker strategy with my friends which we do constantly '
 'I came to the realization that one of the reasons I have thrived in this '
 'game is because I get to have indepth discussions with the best poker '
 'players in the world on a regular basis For most amateur players this will '
 'never happen In this book I am giving you that invaluable opportunity I '
 'handpicked poker players and authors who have a wealth of knowledge to offer '
 'I only asked people to contribute to this book with whom I have talked '
 'strategy or who have impressed me at or away from the table I asked each '
 'author to write about a topic on which they are passionate I know that when '
 'I am passionate I produce excellent content Fortunately all of the authors '
 'did the same This book is a collection of chapters that will discuss '
 'numerous aspects of the game Some chapters are aimed to help beginning '
 'players transform into strong amateurs and other chapters are aimed to help '
 'strong amateurs become worldclass I am confident that players of all skill '
 'levels will learn a huge amount from this book simply because the authors '
 'are some of the best players in the world and they are discussing the '
 'aspects of poker at which they excel Starting in late  once a month each '
 'author and I will host a live webinar like a seminar but online where we '
 'delve deep into a specific topic where the author is a master I have been '
 'hosting webinars for the past few years and my students love them because '
 'they get to interact with and ask me questions in real time If you want to '
 'further your poker knowledge by being part of these exclusive webinars '

 'EXAMINING THE POSTBOOM EVOLUTION IN POKER Introduction Its amazing how much '
 'poker has changed in the last decade When Chris Moneymaker changed the '
 'course of poker history back in  the game was as simple as bets and raises '
 'with Big Slick reigning supreme Nowadays the game is permeated with terms '
 'and concepts that can make your head spin If youre a recreational player '
 'concepts such as small ball range and exploitative versus game theory '
 'optimal strategies can be intimidating Truth is you can still play the game '
 'and have fun without delving so deep into the game in fact Id wager the '
 'majority of players are amateurs with an elementary understating of the game '
 'who are playing to have fun and maybe win a little cash Theres nothing wrong '
 'with that but if you hope to compete against the best and one day win a big '
 'poker tournament you need to know your stuff As a Senior News Editor for '
 'PokerNewscom I quite literally get paid to watch poker I travel to the '
 'biggest tournaments on the circuit to report the action from the floor and '
 'since  Ive witnessed some of pokers greatest moments I was there when Phil '
 'Hellmuth won both his record  and  World Series of Poker bracelets I sat '
 'tableside when the great Phil Ivey won the Aussie Millions  Challenge in two '
 'out of three years and I watched Mark Newhouse conquer inconceivable odds to '
 'make backtoback November Nines in  and  ultimately finishing in ninth place '
 'both years In  I even got the chance to become part of poker history when I '
 'won a WSOP gold bracelet and  in Event   Casino Employees Ive tasted glory '
 'watched river cards decimate dreams and there isnt a bad beat you could tell '
 'me that I havent seen first hand Through it all Ive learned the game is '
 'continually evolving and those who thrive are those who adapt In this '
 'chapter I will take a look back at the evolution of poker since the poker '
 'boom To do this I have selected several transformations that have occurred '
 'over the years and describe hands I feel are demonstrative of those concepts '
 'Some of these hands Ive watched play out live and on TV while others I '
 'personally experienced during my bracelet run Ideally youll use this chapter '
 'as a sounding board See how poker has evolved over the years and critique '
 'your game against it Are you aware of the changes described throughout If '
 'not then youve pinpointed an area that needs improvement Keep in mind that '
 'many of the concepts I discuss are mere introductions designed to show you '
 'the path to becoming a better poker player Many of these concepts are '
 'discussed more thoroughly elsewhere in this book and for those that arent I '
 'encourage you do some outside research to acquaint yourself Outdated poker '
 'adages The poker boom sparked a poker renaissance Tens of thousands of '
 'players were introduced to the game',
 'and all were eager to learn its intricacies Books and articles of the day '
 'advocated a certain playing style that included tight is right and if you '
 'cant raise dont play Such words of wisdom served players well for many years '
 'but as the game evolved many of these adages have fallen by the wayside '
 'Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it many of these '
 'maxims are still the foundation of many players games If thats you dont feel '
 'guilty From  to  my poker game remained largely unchanged and was '
 'underpinned by principles Id learned years before I was winning at that time '
 'so there was no need to change Unfortunately players got better and the game '
 'began to transform Simply put players were evolving and I wasnt adapting I '
 'tried the same old tricks which were no longer working so of course I began '
 'to lose An extended downswing will make anyone reexamine their game and I '
 'was no exception Believe me it wasnt easy to admit that I was no longer good '
 'at a game I loved but once I did I resolved to overhaul my strategy so that '
 'I could compete and win Below are nine strategies that were once the norm in '
 'poker Some still have a place in the game but others are hopelessly outdated '
 'So if youre playing with these things in mind its probably time to change '
 'your game Tight is right It wasnt long ago when playing tight in tournaments '
 'was the thing to do Everyone would wait patiently for a big hand but then '
 'someone came along and realized they could amass tons of chips by stealing '
 'the blinds and antes Before long others picked up on it and an aggression '
 'race was on Ill talk more about preflop aggression later in this chapter but '
 'for now know that playing too tight will open the door for players to take '
 'advantage of you Dont get me wrong there is a time and place for tight is '
 'right It should be a gear you use on occasion not a playing style in itself '
 'Openraise for  If you learned to play poker in the  you were likely told to '
 'raise  when raising For example if the blinds were  then the wisdom of the '
 'day recommended a raise to either  or  That was a standard play in the past '
 'but over the years openraise amount has steadily declined In todays game '
 'many players are opening for the absolute minimum so instead of making it   '
 'in the above example theyll make it  to go This was surprisingly effective '
 'as many players were hesitant to protect their blinds which allowed the '
 'raiser to take down the blinds and antes with minimal pressure investment '
 'and risk Since players are now starting to defend their blinds with a wider '
 'range of hands the game is slowly moving away from the minraise though its '
 'still nowhere near  Sticking with the  example instead of opening for  '
 'players will now up it a bit and raise to something like  Of course youre '
 'free to raise whatever amount youd like but you should be aware what others '
 'are doing and why Find out what works best at your tables and proceed '
 'accordingly Never minraiserespect the raiser Minraising used to be a rare '
 'thing in nolimit holdem mainly because it was perceived as a weak move '
 'However when players realized that oftentimes they could win a pot with '
 'minimal investment the min raise came into fashion As a result the power of '
 'the raise was diluted Players only used to raise with premium cards but now '
 'it seems any two cards will do',
 'A reraise means either aces or kings There was a time that a  or  always '
 'meant pocket kings or aces   and  were as rare as a royal flush Thats no '
 'longer the case and a hand from the UKIPT Season  Finale in London is a '
 'prime example of the shenanigans taking place in the game today In one of '
 'the more interesting hands Ive ever seen Mattias Bergstrom raised to  from '
 'early position holding   and European Poker Tour champ Benny Spindler '
 'reraised to  with K J Paul Foltyn then  to  from the cutoff holding A  '
 'Bergstrom folded after the button and blinds had gotten out of the way and '
 'Spindler thought for a bit before  to  Had the hole cards not been shown the '
 'audience would no doubt have put both players on big pocket pairs but what '
 'was really happening was a leveling war That was evidenced by Foltyns  to  '
 'and especially so when Spindler  allin for  That did the trick as Foltyn '
 'released his hand That hand is an extreme example of reraising but it goes '
 'to show you that aces and kings are no longer needed to play a big pot No '
 'more middle position Poker is a lot more descriptive than it was a decade '
 'ago It used to be that players were either in early middle or late position '
 'but now there are terms for each spot First to act is under the gun UTG '
 'right of the button is the cutoff and one more to the right is the hijack Go '
 'right one more time and youll find the lojack position Theres also   etc It '
 'may seem like a little much to the amateur player but by identifying these '
 'things players were able to better study and understand the game Remember '
 'position is power in poker so why not make it work for you If you cant raise '
 'dont play itnever limp preflop I was always told that when I enter a pot I '
 'should do so by raising I still do that quite often but far from always A '
 'lot of factors position players left to act table image etc influence my '
 'decision but quite often Ill limp with a speculative hand like J  or   in '
 'the hopes of seeing a cheap flop Even if a player puts in a raise it doesnt '
 'cost me much more to continue with the hand if I so choose Plus limping from '
 'early position is often seen as a strong move so theres a good chance '
 'players will give you more credit than you deserve You dont want to limp too '
 'often but dont discount it either Always shove with a stack of  or less Of '
 'all these axioms this one is the most relevant in todays game Still there '
 'have been deviations as some players prefer to shove with  stacks while '
 'others are willing to dip down to  before feeling compelled to make a move  '
 'is still a great line but do whatever youre most comfortable with Always '
 'continuation bet If you raise preflop most of the time you should make a '
 'continuation bet after the flop especially if youre in position and the '
 'action is checked to you Still its by no means mandatory and youre free to '
 'get',
 'creative On occasion trap your opponents take a free card and do whatever '
 'you can to keep them guessing Hit or fold Some players used to play their '
 'hands as straightforwardly as possible If they hit the flop theyd play it '
 'strong If they didnt theyd just give up on the hand It should never be so '
 'simple As Allen Kessler told me Its now the opposite Instead of hit or fold '
 'its miss the flop then float I delve into floating later in this chapter but '
 'the point is players no longer give up on hands so easily This is just a '
 'small sample of archaic poker strategies but if any are a part of your game '
 'you may want to make some changes It was Charles Darwin who introduced us to '
 'survival of the fittest and that concept certainly applies to poker The best '
 'players in the world are constantly studying researching and finetuning '
 'their game in an arduous and neverending process Its daunting but those who '
 'put in the work reap the rewards Ask yourself what you can do to improve '
 'your game The best place to start is to learn what others are doing Below '
 'are a series of gamechanging observations Ive made over the years and I can '
 'confidently say you need to be aware of these advancements if you hope to '
 'compete in this day and age The game has changed Bigger buyins and deeper '
 'stacks Tournament structures which are largely affected by starting stacks '
 'are among the biggest changes in the decade following the poker boom From '
 'the WSOPs inception in  up through  players received a starting stack '
 'equivalent to the amount of each events buyin For example in the Main Event '
 'players received  in tournament chips for the  buyin That was the industry '
 'standard but when the Venetian popularized deepstack tournaments in the '
 'late  it changed everything Players loved the deeper stacks which '
 'theoretically gave them more play As such Harrahs Entertainment now known as '
 'Caesars Entertainment which owns the WSOP decided to offer double the '
 'starting stack in  and then two years later upped it to three times So now '
 'instead of starting the Main Event with  chips players receive  The idea '
 'behind offering more starting chips was to allow for deeper play at the '
 'beginning of a tournament which in turn allowed players the chance to '
 'execute proper strategy However that notion only works when a tournament '
 'features a slow and steady structure The more chips in play the longer '
 'tournaments take to complete so to alleviate time constraints some tours '
 'altered their structures by shortening the length of each level or leaving '
 'some out altogether As a result the tournament played out as a deepstack '
 'event in the beginning but by the time the final table rolled around the '
 'players held shallower stacks in relation to the blinds which leads to more '
 'allin shoves The beststructured tournaments like the WSOP Main Event allow '
 'for deepstack play throughout all stages of the tournament which '
 'theoretically allows the best players to rise to the top Whenever you play a '
 'tournament be aware of the structure and adapt your game accordingly Being '
 'aware of the minutiae is the best way to set you up for success Another '
 'change weve seen in tournament poker was the demise of rebuy events and the '
 'ascension of reentry tournaments The former was done away with at least at '
 'the WSOP in  at the behest of',
 'the Players Advisory Council who argued that public opinion suggested pros '
 'could essentially buy a bracelet in a rebuy event For example if a pro '
 'realizes they have a weak table that isnt going to break for the day they '
 'can play a hyperaggressive style that results in them either amassing a big '
 'stack or flooding the table with chips No matter the result by the time the '
 'rebuy period is over theyre playing superdeepstacked against weak players '
 'which of course gives them an edge Daniel Negreanu echoed this sentiment by '
 'arguing that the average players couldnt afford to fire as many times as a '
 'wellfunded pro much like Layne Flack had done in the  WSOP  PotLimit Omaha '
 'Rebuy event That tournament attracted  players who generated  rebuys  of '
 'which came from Flack That meant he needed to finish in  place which paid  '
 'or better just to show a profit Fortunately for him he went on to win it '
 'for  and his sixth gold bracelet Rebuys may have fallen by the wayside but '
 'the void they left gave way to reentries Similar at first glance there are '
 'actually some stark differences between the two most notably in how theyre '
 'executed A rebuy needs to be done immediately after a player either busts or '
 'falls below a minimum chip mark Once reloaded the player keeps his same seat '
 'in the tournament and continues on uninterrupted With reentries players must '
 'be eliminated from the tournament before they can reenter When they do they '
 'must leave the tournament area reregister and obtain a new seating '
 'assignment Furthermore some tournaments allow for unlimited reentries up '
 'until a certain level while others have established limits such as one '
 'reentry per day Reentry tournaments were popularized shortly after the '
 'economy took a dive Many players were no longer able to afford  buyin '
 'tournaments so tournament organizers responded by lowering buy ins The entry '
 'fees to many World Poker Tour events that formerly cost  were lowered to  '
 'and some as low as  This helped keep numbers up but the prize pools suffered '
 'Enter the reentry When things were really rolling in the poker world we had '
 'tons of players for our regular freezeouts legendary tournament director '
 'Jack McClelland told CardPlayer back in  Freezeouts are normal tournaments '
 'where once a player busts theyre gone for good Then when the economy took a '
 'dive we tried to increase our prize pools by offering rebuys Those didnt '
 'really work out because they scared away those with lower bankrolls who '
 'couldnt afford multiple buyins So far it looks like re entry events appeal '
 'to players of all bankrolls The buyins are low enough to bring in casual '
 'players but still allow the pros to come in and do their thing Not only were '
 'players happy with reentries so were the venues By establishing multiple '
 'starting days they were able to fill their coffers as their hotels '
 'restaurants and poker rooms all benefited not to mention the fact that they '
 'were able to rake each reentry As for the players reentries alleviated the '
 'possibility of traveling to a tournament only to suffer a bad beat and hit '
 'the rail early Reentries began as a novelty but like deepstack events theyve '
 'established themselves as the industry standard aside from the WSOP which '
 'has introduced just a few over the years theyve said the WSOP Main Event '
 'will forever be a freezeout As for the WPT and smaller tournament series a '
 'large percentage of them offer reentries As poker continues to evolve many '
 'have questioned the longterm effects of reentries on the poker economy You '
 'would think that I would like reentry tournaments because they favor players '
 'such as myself but I dont Jonathan Little has previously stated I think '
 'these types of events put the casual players at a tremendous disadvantage '
 'and in general put the entire game in jeopardy The bottom line is that if '
 'the',
 'tremendous disadvantage and in general put the entire game in jeopardy The '
 'bottom line is that if the weak players keep going broke and stop playing '
 'entirely then the poker community as a whole will suffer Thats why I think '
 'the whole reentry concept is a little shortsighted Whether or not deepstack '
 'and reentry tournaments will stand the test of time remains to be seen but a '
 'decade removed from the poker boom they dominate the tournament landscape',
 'The rise of small ball In the first hand of the  WSOP the son of actress '
 'Goldie Hawn a fellow named Oliver Hudson squared off against  WSOP runnerup '
 'Sammy Farha It began when Farha raised to  with A  only to have Hudson  to  '
 'holding the   Action folded back to Farha who called to see a flop of A A  '
 'Both players flopped full houses but of course Farhas was best Two checks '
 'brought about the Q on the turn and then Farha checked for a second time '
 'before Hudson bet  Farha checkraised to  Hudson shoved allin and Farha '
 'snapcalled Hudson watched helplessly as a meaningless jack was put out on '
 'the river and just like that he became the first player eliminated from the '
 'tournament First hand thats it Holy shit Hudson said in disbelief Thats the '
 'way to get beat I guess Hands like that while uncommon were demonstrative of '
 'players willingness to shove allin at the time of the poker boom Then '
 'starting around  things began to change with the rise of small ball a style '
 'of poker utilized by players such Dan Harrington and Daniel Negreanu Small '
 'ball is an advanced strategy for multitable tournaments MTTs in which a '
 'player aggressively plays a wide range of starting hands but does so with '
 'small bets and raises to guard against losing large amounts of chips on any '
 'individual hand The strategy which was first introduced in the Harrington on '
 'Holdem books and later popularized by Negreanu is best used in deepstack '
 'situations because it allows players to gain information over multiple '
 'betting rounds without putting their tournament life on the line The key to '
 'playing small ball is to control the size of the pot because bets on each '
 'street are proportional to the size of the pot As such poker saw a shift in '
 'the size of preflop raises As previously mentioned the standard opening '
 'raise used to be  as Farha had done against Hudson but with small ball the '
 'standard amount gradually decreased You cant really blame Hudson for getting '
 'it in back in  Players threw caution to the winds back then and the stacks '
 'were a bit shallower That said in todays game youd never see an experienced '
 'pro go broke in that spot in the first hand of the tournament Deeper '
 'starting stacks aside players today are a bit warier of their opponents '
 'holding Theres no doubt Hudson flopped a monster but both pocket aces and  '
 'were beating him Likewise when they both checked and a queen appeared on the '
 'turn suddenly pocket queens and AQ were also ahead Those are four hands '
 'Farha could have held and small ball players would be well aware of this As '
 'such they wouldnt be so eager to play a pot for their entire stack Instead '
 'theyd slowly look to build a pot but once they were met with resistance '
 'theyd either give it up or try to control the size of the pot There are '
 'still players out there who will recklessly commit with any hand they '
 'perceive as strong but more players have learned to adapt and pick their '
 'spots more carefully Preflop aggression Joe Tehans epic shove with  Poker is '
 'not a game for the timid In order to succeed you must exhibit aggression '
 'which is something Doyle Brunson preached back in the  However with more '
 'players taking an aggressive approach to the game its imperative that you '
 'strike just the right balance Too little and youll get run over too much and '
 'youll selfdestruct Knowing whom you can push around and in what situations '
 'is an acquired skill Aggression which was once characterized by blanket '
 'labels such as looseaggressive and tightaggressive has been broken down into '
 'mathematical categories such as VPIP chips voluntarily put into the pot '
 'preflop PFR percentage of preflop raises and RR percentage of times a player '
 'is reraising',
 'To give you an idea of these concepts lets take a look at the  World Series '
 'of Poker Main Event On Day  when the field played down from the final  '
 'players to the November Nine PokerNews reported every hand of play live This '
 'allowed for some unique number crunching that resulted in an aggression '
 'profile for each player Lets look at eventual champ Martin Jacobson who took '
 'down a smooth  million for the win The Swede was dealt  hands on Day  of '
 'which he voluntarily put chips into the pot  of the time He also raised and '
 'reraised  and  of the time respectively Jacobson is considered one of pokers '
 'most consistent players he finished Day  of the Main Event as chip leader '
 'after all so despite the small sample size those numbers give you a rough '
 'idea of a professionals preflop aggression To compare heres a look at the '
 'Day  VPIP PFR and RR of the entire  November Nine As you can see the tight '
 'is right maxim no longer rules in tournament poker Instead you should '
 'practice targeted aggression against weak players those who are '
 'inexperienced and tight in critical situations such as the money bubble when '
 'they will be likely to fold to your aggression Preflop aggression works best '
 'because its the point in the hand when players have access to the least '
 'amount of information Take Joe Tehan as an example Hes one of the most '
 'aggressive players Ive had the opportunity to observe and his tactics have '
 'won him more than  million in tournament earnings Back in  Tehan finished '
 'third in the now defunct Epic Poker League  MixMax NoLimit Holdem Main Event '
 'for  I mention that tournament because its where Tehan played an infamous '
 'hand that I believe highlights just how aggressive the game has become It '
 'happened on Day  of the tournament with  players remaining Only  of them '
 'were slated to get paid meaning two players needed to leave empty handed to '
 'ensure the others a minimum payday of  With the blinds at  a shortstacked '
 'Faraz Jaka moved allin for his last  from first position Vanessa Rousso '
 'then  to  leaving herself about  behind and when action reached Tehan he  '
 'allin Rousso thought for a bit and then called off her stack with Q Q Jaka '
 'then showed A A and Tehan tabled   Thats right Tehan had  jammed with  '
 'offsuit Does that strike you as being crazy or do you see some logic behind '
 'it If the former you may want to reconsider This hand is indicative of the '
 'moves top pros make on a regular basis under the right circumstances In this '
 'instance it was on the money bubble of',
 'a major tournament and Tehan believed he could push Rousso off her hand In '
 'the event that he was successful he would take down the sizeable side pot '
 'which covered the amount hed have to invest against Jaka That meant he had '
 'the potential to freeroll against Jaka for a bunch of chips on the money '
 'bubble Not a bad spot to be in Of course its hard to get a player to lay '
 'down pocket queens but what better spot to try than when theres  on the line '
 'If Rousso read the  as strong hands like AA KK or AK she could easily toss '
 'the queens and sit tight until she was in the money Im here to tell you that '
 'if youre not considering moves like Tehans then youre not being aggressive '
 'enough Whats more you have to have the courage to execute those moves when '
 'the opportunities present themselves They work more often than youd think '
 'and in those instances when they dont such as when Rousso called Tehan '
 'theres always the chance youll get lucky Thats just what Tehan did He '
 'managed to pair his four on the    flop and then a third four hit when the '
 'dealer burned and turned the  After the  completed the board on the river a '
 'stunned Jaka and Rousso exited as joint bubble boy and girl and Tehan bagged '
 'up the Day  chip lead with a big smile on his face Of course being '
 'aggressive is a doubleedged sword If youre too aggressive youre more likely '
 'to have others play back at you If youre not aggressive enough theyll '
 'exploit that by attacking your blinds and disrespecting your raises As I '
 'said the best plan is to find a balance Postflop play checkraising my way to '
 'a bracelet In the early days of poker when structures were fast and stacks '
 'shallow players were prone to get their stacks in preflop Now with the rise '
 'of small ball poker players are seeing more flops than ever and that means '
 'being able to navigate postflop situations intelligently has never been so '
 'important Im not going to delve too much into postflop play other than to '
 'say youd better have a plan Whether youre being aggressive or calling a '
 'raise preflop you should know why youre doing what youre doing and have an '
 'idea about how youre going to proceed For example lets say youre sitting '
 'with  at the  level and open for  with  Action folds to the player on the '
 'button and he  to  Both blinds fold and action is back on you What do you do '
 'You can either call raise or fold and no matter which option you choose youd '
 'better have a reason for doing it and an idea of what youre going to do '
 'postflop Lets say you call hoping to hit a set Thatd be great but it only '
 'happens  of the time Do you have any idea what youll do the other  of the '
 'time Great players will know what theyre going to do even before the flop '
 'comes down Granted a lot depends on other factors such as flop texture and '
 'the opponent but the point is that you constantly need to be thinking and '
 'developing postflop strategies Let me give you an example from my  WSOP '
 'bracelet run when I was headsup against Allan Kwong Earlier at the final '
 'table when six of us remained Kwong and I played a big hand that gave me '
 'some useful information It happened in Level   when the action folded to me '
 'on the button I looked down at K  and raised to  Kwong defended from the big '
 'blind and then checkcalled my bet of  on the K K  flop which I loved as it '
 'gave me trips When the  hit on the turn Kwong checked for a second time and '
 'I fired out  I was thrilled to see Kwong call and then check for a third '
 'time on the  river I had been fairly aggressive so I expected Kwong was '
 'defending light possibly with a deuce or some sort of pocket pair I got the '
 'impression that he was willing to pay me off so I bet a hefty  He called and '
 'I confidently tabled my hand Much to my surprise he rolled over the K J for '
 'trips with a better kicker',
 'I lost nearly half my chips in that hand but it could have been worse had '
 'Kwong simply raised Instead he played it passively and I was still in the '
 'game Not only that I now knew he was prone to caution When we reached '
 'headsup play I used that knowledge as the basis of my postflop strategy '
 'Knowing that Kwong was a circumspect player I was able to play the role of '
 'the aggressor and control the pace of the game It was apparent he would only '
 'get involved with a quality hand so my plan was to raise often in the hope '
 'of taking down the blinds When he defended my postflop plan was to bet in '
 'position and to checkraise out of position In fact it was the latter '
 'strategy that ultimately led to my winning the bracelet Admittedly I ran '
 'well during headsup play My starting hands were better than average and I '
 'connected on more flops than I missed Obviously that made it much easier to '
 'execute my strategy As planned my bets and checkraises were getting Kwong to '
 'fold but I knew it was only a matter of time before he got tired of being '
 'pushed around In Level   I was sitting with about  million to Kwongs  '
 'million when he opened for  on the button holding A K and I called with Q  '
 'The Q Q  was a dream flop and I stayed on script by checking Kwong bet  and '
 'I knew this was a great spot to check raise Id been doing it frequently and '
 'whenever I did I made sure it was a big one He was bound to play back at me '
 'sooner or later and I thought another big checkraise might do it Sure enough '
 'I checkraised to roughly  and Kwong fell into the trap by  allin I snap '
 'called and had a virtual lock on the hand The  turn gave him a Broadway draw '
 'to a jack theres always a sweat but he missed when the  blanked on the river '
 'Theres no better feeling than winning a WSOP bracelet even if its the '
 'lowhanging fruit that is the Employees Event but in order to capture one you '
 'need to have a plan This is especially true postflop when available '
 'information begins to complicate the decisionmaking process Things get even '
 'more muddled on the turn and river and if youre playing it by ear mistakes '
 'are bound to happen Incorporating the float into your arsenal A lot of '
 'current trends in modern poker arent exactly new in fact many of the moves '
 'have been around for decades The difference is back then they were known and '
 'practiced by a select few whereas today most players have incorporated them '
 'into their bag of tricks Take floating as an example Heres how we define '
 'float over at PokerNews To call an opponents postflop bet with a weak hand '
 'in order to try and bluff on a later street Often done following a '
 'continuation bet when the person floating with a call suspects the bettor '
 'may not have a strong hand but is waiting until the turn or river to make '
 'the bluff bet or raise Floating which is considered a postflop strategy is '
 'an aggressive move and its my belief that most amateur players are either '
 'unable or unwilling to practice it because of the risk involved Lets look at '
 'an example of a float that didnt go according to plan It happened at the  '
 'World Series of Poker Main Event final table when just three players '
 'remained In Level   on Hand  of the final table Martin Jacobson opened for  '
 'million from the small blind holding A A and Norways Felix Stephensen '
 'defended his big blind with K J The    flop saw Jacobson continue for  '
 'million I think well see a float here to be honest Antonio Esfandiari said '
 'on commentary Just because you have two overcards also if your opponent '
 'missed it really puts him on defense once you call the flop one time A float '
 'is when you call with nothing or a hand that has potential but nothing at '
 'the current moment in which you can take it away at a later street from your '
 'opponent',
 'time A float is when you call with nothing or a hand that has potential but '
 'nothing at the current moment in which you can take it away at a later '
 'street from your opponent Indeed Stephensen called with his kinghigh He knew '
 'that Jacobson would continue on the flop with',
 'most hands such as AK and AQ and by floating he hoped to push him off later '
 'in the hand That meant he planned to either bet or raise on the turn '
 'Unbeknownst to Stephensen the K turn was disaster He had floated with a weak '
 'hand but suddenly he paired up to give him what he couldnt help but think '
 'was the lead Jacobson bet again this time  million and Stephensen called '
 'with top pair Had he not improved his hand Stephensen would have either '
 'raised or folded the turn If he continued to read Jacobson as weak he would '
 'have raised to try and force him off his hand If Jacobson played back then '
 'Stephensen could have gotten away without further damage Instead Stephensen '
 'made a legitimate hand and shifted gears from executing a float to focusing '
 'on getting to showdown Little did he know he was throwing chips away as '
 'Jacobson held a big pocket pair The Q river saw Jacobson tank for nearly two '
 'minutes before betting  million and Stephensen had little choice but to pay '
 'him off Sure enough the Norwegian put in the chips and watched them be '
 'pushed to his Swedish opponent Even though Stephensen lost that hand it was '
 'a great example of a float attempt If Jacobson hadnt held the hand he did '
 'Stephensen likely would have won a big pot As it was this particular float '
 'backfired but dont let that turn you off from trying it Let me give you an '
 'example of a float that did work for the great Phil Ivey On a cash game '
 'episode of Poker After Dark action folded to the  bracelet winner on the '
 'button and he called  with   Tom durrrr Dwan who held Q  put in an '
 'additional  to call from the small blind and then Patrik Antonius checked '
 'his option from the big blind with Q  The A A  flop saw Dwan lead out for  '
 'with his two pair Antonius floated and amazingly Ivey did the same Dwan '
 'checked the A turn with his weak full house and Antonius sprung to life with '
 'a  bet Ivey floated with sevenhigh once again with a call and Dwan opted to '
 'get out of the way When the  completed the board on the river Antonius '
 'slowed down with a check and it was Iveys turn to execute his strategy with '
 'a bet of  Antonius seemed suspicious but there wasnt much he could do but '
 'fold Notice how Ivey had a clear plan after the flop By calling Dwans bet '
 'and Antonius call Ivey knew that he would need to fire big at some point in '
 'the hand if he hoped to win Antonius had the same idea but he was handcuffed '
 'with Ivey being in position which by the way is the best time to float '
 'Floating is nothing new The top pros have been doing it for years but now it '
 'has permeated poker at all levels Not only should you be utilizing the float '
 'in your postflop arsenal you need to be prepared to defend against it '
 'Getting away from big hands In October of  I was in Melbourne Australia for '
 'the WSOP AsiaPacific APAC The  series culminated with a  Main Event which '
 'attracted  players and created a prize pool of  Ill always remember this '
 'tournament for something runnerup Jack Salter said after the tournament He '
 'tweeted Disappointed how I played final hand but very proud how I played '
 'over five days I watched the final hand unfold and I was perplexed as to why '
 'he was disappointed aside from the fact that he lost The hand in question '
 'was a bigtime cooler and then it struck me the game had evolved so much that '
 'players are now capable of getting away from truly sick hands Salter was '
 'disappointed because he felt he could have folded and found a better spot to '
 'commit his chips Heres what happened On Hand  of the final table which took '
 'place in Level    Salter who was sitting with  million raised to  from the '
 'button holding Q  ',
 'Davies who had the bigger stack with  million then  to  with   The    flop '
 'was a major cooler as Salter flopped trips and Davies a full house Davies '
 'continued for  and Salter called I had  my pocket sixes preflop and then the '
 'flop came out I couldnt believe how good I was running Davies told me when '
 'we discussed the hand I made a very small continuation bet just hoping maybe '
 'he would float me When the  appeared on the turn Davies bet  Two flush draws '
 'came on board on the turn and I went for a small double barrel because I '
 'wanted to make sure that I priced in all of his draws Davies explained It '
 'would be an absolute disaster for me if he were to fold a flush draw on the '
 'turn so I want to keep those types of hands in the pot Salter didnt call but '
 'instead put in a raise to  which inspired Davies to  to  million When he '
 'raised the turn I knew he had it I was a little bit afraid that my  would '
 'look really strong but I just didnt think he could get away from a ten there '
 'headsup Davies explained That would be the sickest fold ever So was it '
 'possible to fold there In the old days of poker the answer was a firm no but '
 'the new generation of poker players is able to adapt Based off his tweet '
 'Salter obviously thought a fold was within his abilities and doing so would '
 'have left him with  million which was more than enough to compete However '
 'Salter would need to make the right read to justify folding such a big hand '
 'Davies hadnt gotten out of line in the tournament so his preflop  indicated '
 'strength Salter likely put him on either a pocket pair a big ace or some '
 'sort of flush draw The problem was Salter had so much of Davies range beat '
 'Basically I was fortunate enough to have him coolered and wanted to get the '
 'money in before the board got ugly Davies said I remember seeing him double '
 'check his hole cards and as soon as he did that I was positive he had it I '
 'was just trying to hold it together waiting for those magical words allin so '
 'I could snapcall Salter thought for nearly two minutes before shoving and '
 'indeed Davies snapcalled Salter was drawing to a bigger full house but he '
 'missed as the  bricked on the river to send him home in second place for  '
 'while Davies took down the  firstplace prize and his first gold bracelet A '
 'little insider information for you though the two actually chopped just '
 'minutes before the cooler took place Both locked up over  and left  up top '
 'which of course went to Davies Id have been hardpressed to play this hand '
 'any differently but the thing to take away from it is that Salter actually '
 'contemplated a fold Its a great example of how top players consider and '
 'assess all possibilities before making a decision Right or wrong you should '
 'be thinking through hands as thoroughly and be willing to lay down a big '
 'hand every now and then when you think you are in bad shape against your '
 'opponents range Tells versus range calling it off with  offsuit A big part '
 'of poker is being able to read your opponent In the past this largely meant '
 'picking up on changes in a players behavior be it physical or a betting '
 'pattern which are more commonly known as tells Popularized by Mike Caro '
 'tells are still an integral part of poker but recently theyve taken a '
 'backseat to range which refers to the likely holdings of an opponent based '
 'upon past behavior For example lets suppose youre playing against a tight '
 'player who opens with a raise from early position Knowing this player doesnt '
 'fool around you put him on a strong starting hand that could be any pocket '
 'pair eights and up and maybe AK Based on all the evidence thats the range '
 'youve assigned him under those circumstances On the flip side lets say a '
 'looseaggressive opponent opens from late',
 'under those circumstances On the flip side lets say a looseaggressive '
 'opponent opens from late position Seeing as hes playing so many hands his '
 'range is much wider perhaps any suited cards',
 'connecting cards and pairs all the way up to pocket aces Let me give you '
 'another example that happened during my  WSOP bracelet run With eight '
 'players remaining in Level   the stacks were fairly shallow when action '
 'folded to Michael Trivett who had about  on the button and he raised to  I '
 'hadnt played with Trivett prior to the final table but I knew he had '
 'finished as the Day  chip leader by playing an aggressive game With this '
 'knowledge I assumed his range was wide and that hed raise with pretty much '
 'any two cards from the button As such I liked the A  I looked down at in the '
 'small blind and opted to  to  from my stack of  The player in the big blind '
 'folded and Trivett tanked for a bit before  allin My hand certainly shrank '
 'but in my mind his range didnt change too much I was certain he wouldnt make '
 'such a move with low cards but given his aggressive reputation not to '
 'mention my tight reputation I was confident hed make a move with any pocket '
 'pair any ace and possibly with mediocre hands like  and up I also made up my '
 'mind that he didnt have a huge hand If he had aces kings or queens I figured '
 'he wouldnt want to push me off my hand when I was out of position Why not '
 'just call my  and extract more chips from me on the flop By eliminating both '
 'low cards and big hands I was able to narrow his range and I determined that '
 'my  had some potential I had smaller aces crushed and I was ahead of all '
 'paintcard combinations aside from pairs of course Still it was hard to '
 'commit the majority of my stack in that spot Part of me wanted to fold but '
 'another part of me said if I went against my read the other players would '
 'pick up on it and target me as a weak player I didnt want to get run over '
 'and I couldnt shake the feeling thats what Trivett was doing I probably '
 'should have folded my hand but for all of the above reasons I called Trivett '
 'tabled K J My read was right His cards were in the range Id assigned but '
 'even so I was only a  favorite Fortunately for me I managed to take a '
 'hammerlock on the hand when the A   flop paired my ace The  turn left '
 'Trivett drawing dead and after the K came on the river I jumped to second in '
 'chips I didnt think he had it in him one of my other opponents said after '
 'the hand clearly impressed I was willing to risk my stack with  It was at '
 'that exact point I knew I had a legitimate shot at winning the bracelet My '
 'image went from super tight to someone willing to make moves and go with his '
 'reads No one wanted to mess with me after that hand That is just one example '
 'of putting an opponent on a range which is something you should do every '
 'time you enter a pot Furthermore you need to continually narrow that range '
 'on subsequent streets based upon the information presented to you More '
 'opportunities to learn moving beyond books This chapter has tried to '
 'highlight some of the more notable changes in poker over the past decade but '
 'please keep in mind the game is constantly evolving Theres a good chance '
 'that in another  years what you read here is not only outdated but may also '
 'be detrimental to your game Poker texts such as Super System and Harrington '
 'on Holdem while great poker books that revolutionized the game now contain '

 ' THE SIX INGREDIENTS FOR A WINNING POKER STRATEGY Introduction We are in the '
 'business of creating our own luck Welcome to the recipe for success in poker '
 'NEWSFLASH Playing great poker doesnt mean winning  of the hands you play or '
 'cashing  of the tournaments you enter Playing great poker is about being '
 'prepared for every situation so that when a good opportunity presents itself '
 'youll be able to capitalize on it To be great at something youre going to '
 'have to take some licks along the way The road to greatness is not marked by '
 'perfection it is paved with grit goals and perseverance Michael Jordan '
 'considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time shot a '
 'career  from the field and  from the free throw line Babe Ruths career '
 'batting average was  meaning he failed almost twice as often as he got on '
 'base The best tennis players often have to go to five sets versus inferior '
 'players to get the job done And lets not forget that even with these great '
 'numbers they still frequently come up short of the championship Playing '
 'great poker is no different Youre going to have to fold more often than '
 'youre going to play youre not going to win the pot every time you get '
 'involved and youre certainly going to lose more tournaments than you win or '
 'even cash for that matter How many tournaments do you think Phil Hellmuth '
 'entered to reach  lifetime cashes How much do you think Daniel Negreanu '
 'invested to acquire nearly  in lifetime earnings And you are no different '
 'Despite not scoring  in the victory category you can still win money in this '
 'game and lots of it if you play great Lets look at some numbers in the field '
 'of poker a good poker player wins around  of his showdowns when the cards '
 'are turned up A good poker player wins the pot somewhere between  and  of '
 'the time he sees a flop depending on the game A great tournament player '
 'typically cashes in   of the tournaments he plays and achieves first place '
 'far less frequently But its not how often you win that matters its how much '
 'you make out of your winning opportunities Playing expert poker does not '
 'mean that you will come out victorious in every confrontation What it does '
 'mean is that you stack the deck in your favor not literally of course by '
 'giving yourself as many small edges as possible which add up to a big '
 'advantage over your opponents This is what Im referring to when I say we are '
 'in the business of creating our own luck By understanding what these edges '
 'are you can realize when the scales are tipped in your favor and pounce on '
 'the opportunity This means you will be winning the maximum when you are '
 'getting the best of it and losing the minimum when you are getting the worst '
 'of it Again you may only be winning around  of the time you see the flop but '
 'the amount you win on those occasions will far outweigh the amount you '
 'invested the other  of the time And as we learned from Babe Ruth a few '
 'percentage points over  can be worthy of the Hall of Fame Its important to '
 'understand this because if you have an unrealistic expectation of how often '
 'you should',
 'be getting positive feedback then youre almost certain to end up '
 'disappointed and being too hard on yourself Ive seen so many poker players '
 'beat themselves up over poor results because They were focusing on the wrong '
 'things They had an unreasonably high standards for themselves Harsh '
 'selfcriticism can lead to a negative downward spiral and that is the last '
 'place I want to see you take a trip Id much rather see you take a trip to '
 'the place of your dreams and youll get there with a small combination of '
 'patience and focusing on the right goals So let me help you out with that '
 'Your main goal is to make the best most profitable decision you can every '
 'time the action is on you Sometimes the best play will involve a bet or a '
 'raise sometimes simply a check or a call and quite often the most profitable '
 'play or the least unprofitable will simply be to fold Its very important '
 'that you understand that selecting the option which yields the highest '
 'expectation is your primary goal when playing poker To understand which '
 'option yields the highest expectation you must first understand what equity '
 'is Winning ingredient  equity Equity refers to your chances of winning the '
 'pot This is the prerequisite to the triple threat which I will get on to '
 'later and it comes in a couple of forms Pot equity Pot equity PE is your '
 'chance of winning based on your hand strength If you currently hold the best '
 'hand you will probably there are a few exceptions have the highest equity of '
 'the players involved The more community cards left to come the more variable '
 'your equity will be As we progress onto the later streets turn and river the '
 'more set in stone equities become Preflop equities run quite close think '
 'coin flips but on the river equities are such that one player has all the '
 'pot equity while the other has none think of the checkmark on the World '
 'Series of Poker broadcasts when a player is guaranteed to win a pot so long '
 'as they dont fold their hand Example If you hold A A on an    board and your '
 'opponent could have A K A Q A J K Q Q J J  KK QQ JJ or  then your pot equity '
 'is  Most of the time your opponent has a smaller pair than yours which is '
 'about a  underdog And occasionally they will have the flush draw which is '
 'about a  underdog Because they have a pair much more often than they have a '
 'flush draw the overall weighted pot equity is very much in your favor But '
 'there is more than one way to win a poker hand If the only thing that '
 'mattered was the cards poker would be purely a game of chance with the '
 'winner being decided randomly every round by the deal But we know that poker '
 'isnt purely a game of luck its a game of skill with elements of luck '
 'sprinkled in The luck is in the cards you are dealt but the skill is in the '
 'betting and how you play your cards Fold equity Fold equity FE on the other '
 'hand is your chance of winning based on the likelihood of making your',
 'opponents throw their cards away based on your betting action When choosing '
 'passive actions such as checking and calling your fold equity is zero When '
 'choosing aggressive actions such as betting and raising your fold equity is '
 'some positive amount Typically the more you choose the bet the higher your '
 'fold equity will be because most opponents will usually fold more hands to a '
 'bigger bet than they would to a small bet Lets assume again we have A A on '
 'the    board Well also assume that if we bet half the size of the pot our '
 'opponent will continue with all hands If we bet the amount that is in the '
 'pot he will fold his JJ and  and if we bet four times the size of the pot he '
 'will only continue with pocket kings Our opponent will have unpaired hands '
 'more often than a pocket pair because there are more ways to make unpaired '
 'hands With pocket pairs you have four cards to choose from namely the four '
 'aces and thus six total ways to make the hand With unpaired hands however '
 'you have eight cards to choose from four aces and four kings which makes '
 'for  different ways to make a hand four suited and  unsuited Bet  Opponent '
 'folds  of  hands fold equity  Bet full pot Opponent folds  of  hands fold '
 'equity  Bet  pot Opponent folds  of  hands fold equity  When combined these '
 'equities determine your overall chance of winning a hand while factoring in '
 'all possible outcomesrunouts and are your Yin Yang of winning poker The fold '
 'equity is the Yang or aggressive part of the operation while the pot equity '
 'is the Yin or yielding part of the operation Total equity FE  x PE This '
 'formula illustrates that your total equity comes from your fold equity added '
 'to your pot equity if your fold equity doesnt materialize  represents the '
 'percentage of the time that an opponent does not fold to your bet Your fold '
 'equity is designed to get your opponent out of the ring and forfeit the pot '
 'to you But sometimes getting them out of the picture isnt required If your '
 'pot equity is strong and secure enough such as when you hold the best '
 'possible hand then you dont mind having your opponent stick around because '
 'you can win by decision which is the showdown in poker Playing a strategy '
 'grounded in having multiple ways to win is significantly better than having '
 'only one way to win So maximize your expected winnings by maximizing your '
 'equity and maximize your equity by implementing the triple threat position '
 'aggression and hand selection Get it Got it Good Now that youve got the Yin '
 'and Yang of winning poker its time to move on to the Holy Grail This will '
 'maximize your equity and stack the deck in your favor Winning ingredient  '
 'position Not familiar with position Read this Position simply refers to your '
 'physical location at the table relative to the dealer button When the cards '
 'are first dealt the player with the button has the best position with '
 'everyone elses position getting relatively worse as we move counterclockwise '
 'around the table So when the cards are first dealt everyone to your left has '
 'position over you However once the preflop action has taken place some of '
 'those players will have folded their hands thus decreasing the number of '
 'players who have position on you If you can make a raise that knocks out all '
 'of the players behind you you are said to be buying position or buying the '
 'button If you want to see the best results when playing youll want to place '
 'a heavy premium on position',
 'Already positionally aware Read on Position is to poker what location is to '
 'real estate Its not absolutely everything but when youve got it all other '
 'factors become much less of a consideration for making a decision in terms '
 'of whether or not to get involved in a pot When youve got it your chances of '
 'emerging victorious at the end of the hand are much higher than they are '
 'when you dont have it There are many reasons for this The benefits of '
 'position The flow of the chips If all other things were equal cards skill '
 'level chip stacks the chips on a poker table would flow in a clockwise '
 'direction towards the dealer button the player with the best position Put it '
 'this way having position is like playing with the table slightly tilted in '
 'your direction so when all is said and done the chips are just that slight '
 'bit more likely to slide your way When playing poker your winnings will most '
 'likely come from the players on your right and your losses will most likely '
 'go to the players on your left This is due to the element of position and '
 'the way it fits into the rules of the game It is for this reason that the '
 'most lucrative seat at the table is typically directly to the left of the '
 'weakest player on the table Not all seats at the table are equal and now you '
 'know the primary reason why You must also be aware of the stack sizes of '
 'players on either side of you You will tend to win pots from the players on '
 'your right and lose pots to players on your left So if the players on your '
 'right have short stacks but the players on your left have large stacks you '
 'should probably find a better seat because you will likely win small pots '
 'from the players on your right and lose large pots to the players on your '
 'left Informational advantage Poker is all about making the best decision you '
 'can in the presence of imperfect information Knowledge is power and the '
 'player in position is the one who is privy to the most information The '
 'difference in expectation between folding calling and raising is often very '
 'small Any additional information you can garner to help you determine which '
 'action has a higher expectation is essential to your bottom line Being in '
 'position means that you act after your opponents on every betting round '
 'giving you a much better shot at making good decisions compared to your '
 'opponents who are acting with less information You can play many more hands '
 'in late position compared to early position because you get to see what '
 'happens before the action gets to you For example if you have  in a fiveway '
 'pot and the flop comes  you could easily have the best hand or be crushed If '
 'you are in early position you will usually have to make a bet and see what '
 'develops If you are in late position you get to see what happens before the '
 'action gets to you If someone bets and someone either calls or raises you '
 'can usually safely fold If everyone checks to you you can happily bet for '
 'value Control of the action Being in position also comes with the benefit '
 'that the action must flow through you Because you get to act last this will '
 'often give you the opportunity to take free cards free showdowns and set '
 'traps more effectively than you could without position Having position gives '
 'you much more control over the betting and thus it gives you control over '
 'the size of the pot Being able to make the pot grow large when you have a '
 'high chance of winning is crucial to playing great poker Likewise the value '
 'of keeping the pot size under control when the odds arent in your favor '
 'should not be underestimated Pots grow exponentially in nolimit holdem which '
 'makes this benefit of position extremely important',
 'You will find that playing drawing hands is much easier when you have '
 'position If you have a straight or flush draw out of position bet and get '
 'raised you are usually in a miserable situation If you now re raise you '
 'could easily get your money in as a big underdog and if you call and happen '
 'to complete your draw on the turn you will have a difficult time extracting '
 'value This is because if you bet your opponent could easily fold and if you '
 'check he will often check behind unless he has a premium hand If you are in '
 'position instead everything works more favorably If you bet and get raised '
 'you can happily call If your opponent bets again on the turn whether or not '
 'you complete your draw you can usually call due to getting reasonable pot '
 'odds and also because you will be in position on the river If your opponent '
 'bets again on the river you can continue if you hit your draw and simply '
 'fold if you miss If your opponent checks you should certainly bet if you hit '
 'and may be able to bluff when you miss Notice that you get to decide if the '
 'last huge bet goes in on the river when you are in position whereas when you '
 'are out of position your opponent gets to decide This is crucial These three '
 'things alone will have a huge impact in terms of stacking the deck in your '
 'favor which is why position should be your best friend in the realm of poker '
 'It will allow you to gather more information about your opponents possible '
 'holdings The more effectively you can deduce their possible holdings the '
 'more accurately you can evaluate whether you should aim to win via fold '
 'equity via pot equity or whether you are in a situation which warrants '
 'folding and moving on to the next hand Position will greatly help you '
 'determine the best course of action Winning ingredient  aggression Being '
 'aggressive further stacks the deck in your favor by incorporating one of '
 'your additional ways to win fold equity When dealing with this element you '
 'are no longer relying on your cards to do the work you are relying on '
 'yourself Using aggression allows you to put your opponents to tough '
 'decisions thereby giving them the opportunity to make mistakes such as '
 'folding the best hand This is truly where the heart of the game lies taking '
 'the information youve gathered and using it to wager on what you believe to '
 'be true At the same time you are forcing your opponents to make difficult '
 'decisions This is where the skill comes in being able to identify a good bet '
 'when you see one knowing if your opponent is capable of doing the same and '
 'making your offer or wager accordingly It is a battle of wits in its purest '
 'form Forget the boardroom table Forget the battlefield This is a game where '
 'everyone is privy to the same information and this is where the better '
 'players triumph This is poker baby The information is out there but you have '
 'to know what to look for This book will help you identify and understand '
 'that But having the information and knowing how to capitalize on it is '
 'effectively a whole new ballgame Here are some of the benefits you will '
 'experience by using aggression to your advantage The benefits of aggression '
 'Control When you are in charge of the betting you are in control of the most '
 'important aspect of the game the odds Folding and calling are binary options '
 'you either do them or you dont Betting on the other hand is a spread option '
 'with a wide spectrum of possibilities The way your opponents will react to '
 'an allin bet is very different to the way they will react to a minimum bet '
 'The same goes for every bet along the spectrum between these two extremes',
 'When you bet on the smaller side less than  of the pot you are laying '
 'yourself good odds your bet doesnt need to win the pot very often to show a '
 'positive expectation At the same time you are laying your opponent good odds '
 'and thus you should expect them to come along for the next round of betting '
 'a good amount of the time However when you bet on the larger side near the '
 'size of the pot or greater you are increasing your risk but at the same time '
 'you are laying your opponent worse odds to continue This large bet needs to '
 'win more often than a small bet to show a positive expectation and naturally '
 'because your opponent is being offered worse odds they will probably fold '
 'more often than they would to a small bet Sometimes you will welcome action '
 'from your opponents while on other occasions you will prefer to win the pot '
 'immediately with no further confrontation When your pot equity is high your '
 'hand is beating most of your opponents possible holdings you can bet in a '
 'fashion that encourages your opponent to come along with you This is '
 'referred to as a value bet When your chances of winning based on your pot '
 'equity are low however its time to use fold equity to your advantage This is '
 'referred to as a bluff or a semibluff For example suppose someone raises to  '
 'and you call on the button with  playing  stacks The flop gives you a set '
 'and your opponent bets  In some situations you should call in some you '
 'should raise small and in some you should raise large Your opponents '
 'tendencies and what he thinks about your play are a major factor in this '
 'decision Some players will assume that you will only make a large raise with '
 'premium hands and some will think the opposite assuming you must be trying '
 'to steal the pot with a large raise When the flop comes with no draws such '
 'as  you should tend to either call or raise small perhaps to  This is '
 'because you dont mind giving your opponent excellent pot odds since he is '
 'usually drawing nearly dead If the flop comes with numerous draws such as    '
 'you should tend to raise a bit larger perhaps to around  because it is now '
 'possible that your opponent has a decent amount of equity Choosing the '
 'proper bet size is a highly complex issue However the key thing to '
 'understand is that if you are the one playing offensively rather than '
 'defensively you will be the one determining your odds Fear equity and '
 'inducing mistakes Lets be honest most people dont like the idea of having to '
 'make tough decisions They find them stressful they find them uncomfortable '
 'and they have a hard time letting go when they feel they may have made the '
 'wrong choice For this reason alone a lot of people will go out of their way '
 'to avoid having to make tough decisions In the world of poker this may mean '
 'following a strict hand chart only playing in overly soft games or seeking '
 'out a specific system that takes all the decision making out of the game '
 'This is not only common but in many cases it is normal People dont like '
 'discomfort When presented with a situation where the possibility of making a '
 'suboptimal choice is very real they will often freeze up and shy away from '
 'the situation Everybody makes mistakes When you play poker you must accept '
 'that you are going to make mistakes The key is to learn from your mistakes '
 'and treat them as lessons rather than losses That being said you will find '
 'that its pretty hard to make a mistake if youre never put to a test You want '
 'your opponents to be making mistakes because thats where you make your '
 'profit This is another reason why an overall aggressive strategy will '
 'benefit your poker game Fear equity is one of the main reasons why  before '
 'the flop is so powerful especially against players who are not accustomed to '
 'dealing with aggression If someone normally raises with a decently',
 'players who are not accustomed to dealing with aggression If someone '
 'normally raises with a decently wide range in a small stakes passive game '
 'then when you start  him with a high frequency especially when in position '
 'he will have a tough time fighting back He either has to start ',
 'somewhat wide something of which most players are simply not capable or '
 'playing tighter preflop which he will not like doing Most likely this player '
 'will fold way too often call your  then play poorly after the flop or lose '
 'his mind and start  way too often Either way by applying aggression you have '
 'induced your opponents to make costly mistakes By playing aggressively you '
 'constantly put your opponents to tough decisions This will make some players '
 'fearful of playing with you hence the term fear equity Some players will '
 'simply choose to avoid you allowing you to pick up a lot of uncontested pots '
 'Others may try to take a stand against you often at the wrong time because '
 'they didnt factor in that you were anticipating this Most players have a '
 'breaking point and constantly probing at them is the fastest way to reach it '
 'Bluffing winning without the best of it You dont need the best hand to win '
 'in poker All you need is a good enough understanding of your opponents '
 'commitment threshold In every situation in poker there will be some '
 'distribution of hands your opponent can have their range Some of these hands '
 'will be very weak some will be mediocre and some will be very strong When '
 'you are betting you are representing a certain amount of strength It is up '
 'to your opponent to deduce from your bet size just how much strength that is '
 'Typically they would throw away hands that are worse than what you are '
 'representing and continue with hands that are better unless of course they '
 'are playing a strong aggressive game themselves This threshold will vary '
 'depending on your opponents cards The stronger their hand the higher their '
 'threshold Unless they are holding the absolute nuts there will always be '
 'some number to which they say You know what thats just too much Nice bet kid '
 'You must figure out if betting that amount is worth the risk to win whats in '
 'the pot As I am sure you know its very hard to connect with most flops in '
 'nolimit holdem especially if you are playing too loose before the flop The '
 'chances of flopping top pair with AK is about  with  its about  and with   '
 'its less than  The chance of flopping a strong draw straight or flush with '
 'suited connectors is around  but that is still far from a made hand Its hard '
 'enough to hit the flop when youve got three cards to make something Its even '
 'harder to connect on the turn or the river Put bluntly most of the time '
 'nobody is going to catch anything on the board yet most peoples requirements '
 'for calling bets after the flop demands some sort of piece of the board By '
 'playing an aggressive strategy you can win pots based on the merits of the '
 'stories you tell with your betting More importantly when you are in control '
 'of the betting you choose how often your opponents must fold for your bets '
 'to be profitable and if your opponents fold your cards dont matter Tell a '
 'believable story and youll probably get the result you desire Attempt to '
 'sell something thats rather uncreditable and youre likely to get caught Your '
 'story should be consistent throughout the hand Be aware of what youre '
 'representing a made hand a draw or a mix of both If you make reckless bets '
 'your bluffs are likely to fail because your story has to make logical sense '
 'The most beautiful part about aggressive play after the flop is how rarely '
 'your bets need to take down the pot to show a positive expectation Assuming '
 'you have no cards and thus no pot equity here are the numbers showing how '
 'often a bet needs to work to make you money  bet for breakeven opponent must '
 'fold   bet for breakeven opponent must fold  potsized bet for breakeven '
 'opponent must fold   pot overbet for breakeven opponent must fold  When you '
 'compare that to peoples commitment thresholds for calling even the smallest '
 'of bets the',
 ' pot overbet for breakeven opponent must fold  When you compare that to '
 'peoples commitment thresholds for calling even the smallest of bets the '
 'power of aggression becomes very clear But be wary some of your opponents '
 'will be thinking',
 'opponents and they will be putting together the pieces of your story to see '
 'if you could actually have a real hand and still be betting The good hand '
 'readers will be able to deduce when your bet is inconsistent with what you '
 'have been claiming to have all along Like Daniel Negreanu always says When '
 'things dont make sense I just call Investing in your future Weve talked '
 'about the power of being in control of your destiny Weve talked about the '
 'fact that people dont like being taken out of their comfort zone Weve talked '
 'about the fact that you dont need cards to win pots But weve also identified '
 'that most players have a breaking point and that when they hit that breaking '
 'point youd better be able to show them the goods Why do we bluff in poker '
 'Ill give you a few hints its not for the thrill its not for the rush its not '
 'to satisfy your ego Its so that we can get paid off when we have a strong '
 'hand In the long run everyone gets their fair share of coolers and bad beats '
 'Everyone gets the aces over kings the flushes and the full houses The amount '
 'that each player gets paid off on the other hand is where worldclass players '
 'differ from amateur players Think about it If you had an opponent who only '
 'ever bet when they had the best possible hand it would be pretty easy to '
 'play against them You simply never call their bets Likewise if you had a '
 'player who only bets when they are bluffing and always tried to trap with '
 'their big hands you would simply call them down when you have any piece of '
 'the board and you wouldnt bet with any of your medium strength hands when '
 'they check to you If your opponents think youre a bluffer you can expect to '
 'get paid off on a lot of your hands Theyre going to keep you honest This is '
 'how many players will react once they grow tired of you putting them to '
 'tough decisions If they have you pegged as a nut peddler then you can expect '
 'to get away with a lot of bluffs because in their minds they dont need to '
 'see your cards because they know you only play the nuts This means they will '
 'rarely call your bets and force you to go to showdowns This is what youll '
 'usually get when your opponents see you as an honest player However a player '
 'who is capable of betting with or without a strong hand offers a more '
 'challenging situation To play against this type of player you must deduce '
 'whether the odds you are being offered correspond to how often your hand is '
 'better than your opponents and this is very difficult for most people to '
 'assess To understand this properly requires digging into the real depths of '
 'the game and most opponents simply dont have the time or inclination to do '
 'so It is hard work so many players prefer to categorize their opponents as '
 'either bluffers or nut peddlers and take it from there When you play '
 'aggressively you will be seen as a catalyst You create action and your '
 'opponents have two choices sit back and hope to get a piece of that action '
 'or hop in the tank and swim with the shark The beauty of playing '
 'aggressively is that you have so much flexibility when it comes to the size '
 'of your bets so much control and opponents will often overlook this '
 'essential part of the operation When it comes to making their decisions all '
 'your opponents can do is react based on what is being projected at them If '
 'someone believes that you are a complete lunatic then theyre probably not '
 'going to play very intelligently against you To your less savvy opponents '
 'you may appear to be out of control to your more knowledgeable counterparts '
 'you will either get the nod of approval or an impending battle of egos '
 'Either way by maintaining a strong awareness and practicing humility you '
 'will be in complete control of all that is in your power at the poker table',
 'When you play aggressively you are giving yourself the opportunity to win '
 'based on your fold equity with the merits of your pot equity acting as an '
 'emergency hatch A wellrounded strategy balances both these elements placing '
 'a higher emphasis on aggression when strong hands are nowhere to be seen By '
 'employing the passive actions of checking and calling you are relying on '
 'your cards to do the talking These passive actions can show a strong '
 'expectation but it requires that your cards are going to win at the showdown '
 'at least as often as the odds you are being offered Winning ingredient  '
 'selection Selection is the final ingredient of the triple threat and theres '
 'no surprise that it finds itself at the bottom of the list Showdowns are not '
 'the prime means for determining the winner in nolimit holdem and thus your '
 'cards are the least important consideration in your play Who you are up '
 'against what theyre playing and how they play are much more important In '
 'some situations you can play  of hands before the flop and still expect to '
 'show a profit and in other situations that number may be as small as  For '
 'example against someone who raises every hand but then folds to a reraise '
 'before the flop with almost all of his range you should reraise with an '
 'overly wide range because you know that you will steal the pot before the '
 'flop a high percentage of the time If instead your opponent only raises with '
 'AA you should never reraise even with your absolute best hands because you '
 'will always get your money in bad While most players are not this extreme '
 'you will occasionally find players who have similar glaring holes in their '
 'game especially on the turn and river Think of selection as your escape '
 'hatch for when your other plans didnt work You tried to move your opponent '
 'off their hand with skillful betting and using position to your advantage '
 'but alas they wouldnt release You knew that this was a possible outcome and '
 'the more likely it was to come to this the more adequately prepared you '
 'should be for this last stand You cant control the cards that will come but '
 'you can prepare for all the different possible outcomes There are a finite '
 'number of starting hands that can be dealt in Texas holdem  to be exact '
 'There are also a finite number of flops turns and rivers When you multiply '
 'all the possibilities the number is far from small but it is also very far '
 'from the realm of the infinite Knowing every single possible board run out '
 'isnt a prerequisite to playing winning poker although it couldnt hurt but '
 'understanding that there are average flops above average flops and below '
 'average flops for various hands is an important concept to grasp The same '
 'goes for turns and rivers There are some that will be very favorable to you '
 'and others that will be very unfavorable To have the deck stacked in your '
 'favor youll want to focus on playing above average holdings but what '
 'actually constitutes above average For that lets go back to preflop and '
 'examine the key variables that are often overlooked by less seasoned poker '
 'players Remember poker is a game that is situational and very rarely will '
 'the exact same situation come up twice Knowing the variables to consider is '
 'essential to developing a winning strategy How many players were dealt in '
 'This is the biggest single determining factor in what constitutes a strong '
 'hand The average strength of a playable hand in a  game is going to be much '
 'weaker than that in a  game This is pretty basic mathematics and if youd '
 'like to see what these percentages actually mean you can view my',
 'hand ranking charts see jonathanlittlepokercomevancharts or play around with '
 'an equity calculator Players dealt in Average strongest hand top '
 'percentile                 This is one reason why it is crucial to factor '
 'your position into your decision as to whether or not you should be entering '
 'the pot preflop If everyone had the same skill level postflop the player who '
 'only plays above average hands is going to take home a larger share of the '
 'spoils than one who is playing below average hands So if you were to raise '
 'QJ  percentile or    percentile from first position in a  game youre '
 'probably asking for trouble Its quite simple really bigger cards make bigger '
 'pairs bigger flushes bigger straights and flop more equity on average than '
 'their lower ranking counter parts Your equity represents your chances of '
 'coming out ahead and this is the easiest area in which you can maximize your '
 'equity Only play hands that are above average given the number of players in '
 'the game The same goes for play after the flop If multiple players see the '
 'flop then the threshold for the average strongest hand is much higher than '
 'it would be if only two people saw the flop Preflop hands miss the flop in '
 'holdem around  of the time but when you and three opponents see the flop '
 'suddenly the chances that everyone else excluding the hero missed are more '
 'like  The more players involved the more selective you need to be with your '
 'requirements for continuing to invest money after the flop For example with  '
 'as the preflop aggressor on a  flop if you are against one opponent then you '
 'can feel confident betting your hand for value If instead seven players saw '
 'the flop you should usually check and see what develops because if you bet '
 'and get called or raised you are either crushed at the moment or against a '
 'hand that has a large amount of equity against you When lots of players see '
 'the flop even with strong hands such as top pair you must proceed with '
 'caution What are the stack sizes There are a few different types of hands in '
 'nolimit holdem and different types of hands play best at different stack '
 'depths Premium preflop hands such as big pairs and big high card hands play '
 'best when stacks are shallow These hands have a strong equity advantage '
 'before the flop and will still usually be ahead on the flop When stacks are '
 'short the preflop and flop betting rounds are the most significant It is '
 'difficult to get enough money in on the later streets to justify speculating '
 'on the early betting rounds Before any action the blinds and antes are the '
 'prize that you are chasing Your stack size determines your maximum risk to '
 'achieve that reward When your maximum risk is small the minimum requirements '
 'for going after that prize are much lower As stacks get deeper its important '
 'to play hands that can make strong fivecard poker hands Drawing hands play '
 'much better when stacks are deep as you want cards that can make strong '
 'hands on the later betting rounds This is because the amount of money still '
 'left to wager on these streets is much more',
 'significant when playing deepstacked and if you are able to get action when '
 'holding a made hand such as a set straight or flush you are going to have an '
 'extremely big equity advantage For example hands like  and   should usually '
 'be played when you have  stacks in position and are facing a raise However '
 'when you have only  you should almost always fold to a preflop raiser This '
 'is purely due to your lack of implied odds If you can get a lot of money in '
 'the pot on the later betting rounds where your equity is close to  then your '
 'speculative investment preflop on the flop andor on the turn will have been '
 'justified The deeper the stacks are the more you stand to gain if you hit '
 'your hand and also the more room you have to bluff your opponents when scary '
 'cards come Pay attention to how much money went in on each street who was '
 'the favorite and how big a favorite they were at each junction What cards '
 'come on the board isnt as important as how much money was committed when you '
 'had the best hand versus how much was committed when you were drawing and '
 'what your pot odds were Higher ranking hands also have a better shot of '
 'being on the right side of cooler situations A pair of sevens is never going '
 'to get oversetted by a pair of deuces A suited ace is never going to get '
 'over flushed by a suited connector In these situations the equity is heavily '
 'in favor of the superior hand As stacks get very deep its important to be '
 'extra cautious when playing hands that can easily make premium but still '
 'second best hands If you are the one playing below average hands you are '
 'more likely to find yourself on the wrong side of a cold deck and the more '
 'chips you commit when you are drawing dead the bigger an impact it will have '
 'on your bottom line When stacks are shallow however the loss is much less '
 'significant in terms of big blinds and thus the threat of being drawminated '
 'is much less of a concern since these cooler flops dont come up too often I '
 'recently played a hand in a major tournament that illustrates this concept '
 'With  stacks at  I raised to  with A  in middle position A good loose '
 'aggressive player called on the button and the big blind called The flop '
 'came Q   I bet  and only the button called The turn was the Q    completing '
 'my flush I bet  and the button called The river was Q    K At this point I '
 'thought the button would fold most one pair hands worse than a king to '
 'almost any reasonable bet I thought he would never fold if he happened to '
 'have a flush I was unsure how much he would call if he had a set or two pair '
 'but I thought those hands besides exactly KQ were unlikely So the only bet '
 'sizes that have much merit are a tiny bet hoping to get called by one pair '
 'and better and a giant bet looking to get full value from a flush I decided '
 'to make the large bet because I thought it was somewhat likely that my '
 'opponent had a flush and I also thought he may fold his one pair hands even '
 'to a tiny bet I decided to go allin for  into the  pot My opponent quickly '
 'called losing to my nut flush He decided to show everyone the bad beat he '
 'took with his   While I am unsure if my opponent made much of an error on '
 'any betting round voluntarily playing   even in position against a strong '
 'player who is capable of extracting value with his strong hands is usually '
 'not a good idea How many players are left to act Building on the idea of '
 'playing above average hands its important to identify who is still left to '
 'act as this will affect your minimum starting hand requirements When dealing '
 'with players who will call raises or limp along with very weak holdings you '
 'can play more hands This is because on average you will still be holding '
 'superior cards to those of your opponents If you have passive or weak '
 'players left to act',
 'still be holding superior cards to those of your opponents If you have '
 'passive or weak players left to act you can open raise with more hands than '
 'you otherwise would especially when it comes to speculative hands Players '
 'who play too many hands are asking to get coolered To increase the frequency '
 'with which you cooler them you have to loosen up your opening standards a '
 'little bit When dealing with tough opponents who will apply a lot of '
 'pressure postflop youll want to consider playing an even narrower range of '
 'hands than you normally would to compensate for the big postflop edge',
 'they may have against you This type of player is very hard to extract money '
 'from especially when they have position on you Against smart aggressive '
 'opponents youll want stronger cards to back you up in a potential '
 'confrontation Also realize that as stacks get deeper the more significant '
 'the positional advantage becomes In some situations you will be forced to '
 'open very few hands because of your position at the table Against weak '
 'opponents however you will be the one with the edge even if you are out of '
 'position Remember if you can expect to extract a lot of value after the flop '
 'youre allowed to loosen up and speculate a bit more preflop But do not '
 'delude yourself getting paid off when you hit a hand is far from automatic '
 'It requires a strong feel for your opponents and the strategies they employ '
 'Finally you want to consider how likely you are to find yourself in position '
 'after the flop You should be inclined to open more hands if you can buy '
 'position by doing so Conversely if you are unlikely to acquire position with '
 'a preflop raise then you should be more selective about which hands you open '
 'What is the action before you When everyone folds to you you are playing '
 'against a set of random hands all falling somewhere between AA and  At this '
 'point raising above average hands when its folded to you is a fine starting '
 'strategy Once someone enters the pot before you all of this changes Suddenly '
 'you are dealing with an interested hand not a random one If you want to win '
 'the pot you will either have to showdown a stronger hand or force your '
 'opponent to fold by the river A good default strategy assuming no positional '
 'or betting advantage is only to enter the pot with hands that are stronger '
 'than the hands your opponent would have entered the pot with This will give '
 'you an equity advantage right out of the gate Against weaker players you '
 'should be able to play more hands because of your implied odds after the '
 'flop based on your ability to take the pot away on a later round or getting '
 'paid off if you make a strong hand Stack depth and the type of opponent you '
 'are against are very important to consider before making a speculative call '
 'Its very hard to make a strong hand and if that is your only plan of action '
 'then youd better be dealing with an opponent who pays off like a slot '
 'machine Against strong players you may want to play significantly fewer '
 'hands than them if you feel like they have an advantage over you after the '
 'flop Remember its not about winning every hand or getting involved in every '
 'possible confrontation Its about being a smart investor and carefully '
 'choosing your spots to get involved This is where my opponent went wrong in '
 'the previous example where he called my preflop raise with   on the button '
 'If I was a weak player who frequently failed to get full value from my big '
 'hands and would give up to the tiniest bit of pressure when I miss my '
 'opponent should happily call because he will have an easy time winning the '
 'pot postflop Instead my opponent made the error of playing a pot against a '
 'strong player with a hand that is easily drawminated It cost him his '
 'tournament life When players open the pot with a limp you are up against a '
 'nonrandom hand and should proceed accordingly When faced with a limp you '
 'will have to decide whether you want to isolate the limper with a raise '
 'again considering your chances of winning the hand immediately or later limp '
 'along and encourage a multiway pot or fold if your hand is too weak to get '
 'involved against this nonrandom hand For example when someone limps from '
 'middle position you should usually assume he does not have a strong hand '
 'especially if you know that specific player usually raises with his strong '
 'hands Even with fairly weak holdings such as  and  you should raise not '
 'because you think you have the best',
 'fairly weak holdings such as  and  you should raise not because you think '
 'you have the best hand but because you will easily be able to make your '
 'opponent fold most of his weak range by the river if you relentlessly apply '
 'pressure However if someone limps from first position you should be much '
 'more cautious almost always folding  or  because it is too likely that the '
 'first position limper is either trapping with a premium hand such as AA or '
 'playing conservatively with a strong hand such as',
 'AJ or  Looking to your left and watching for intention cues will greatly '
 'help you deduce whether there is an interested player waiting to act behind '
 'you If you anticipate a player behind you has been dealt a strong holding '
 'you should be more selective about getting involved A hand that may have '
 'been a marginal open can become an easy fold if you see someone who cant '
 'wait to get some chips in the pot This process requires being attentive and '
 'accurately assessing what types of hands your opponents will get involved '
 'with and in what ways Remember that we want to be playing above average '
 'hands based on the situation and you must constantly reevaluate situations '
 'to determine where the line of average lies Winning ingredient  attitude The '
 'biggest predictor of how well you will perform on the poker tables and how '
 'much youll develop as a player is your attitude and how you view yourself '
 'When you look at yourself in the mirror or when you visualize yourself in '
 'your minds eye what do you see Do you see a winner or a loser What sort of '
 'stories do you tell yourself about yourself and the way you player poker Are '
 'they positive affirming stories or are they negative selfdefeating stories '
 'Its quite amazing how much power we have over our reality with our minds If '
 'I think of myself as a champion Im going to do everything I can in my power '
 'to make that come to fruition However if I think of myself as a loser if I '
 'believe that everyone else out there is better than me and I simply dont '
 'have what it takes to compete with them Im going to make that my reality Im '
 'simply not going to invest the time required to become great because theres '
 'no point in working hard because Im just never going to be as good as my '
 'competition Have you heard that before Well I used to say that many times in '

 'Its easy to say that youre too far behind Its easy to say that its '

 'task Usually when someone focuses on the end goal rather than the steps '
 'along the way the task seems overwhelming and the journey becomes '
 'unenjoyable So lets look at how we can reframe things positively to keep you '
 'on the path to golden bracelets dollar bills and whatever else fits in your '

 'other peoples problems or challenges then youll never get a chance to deal '
 'with and get past your own If youre constantly bombarded by the chatter of '
 'public television and social media youll get caught up in their beliefs and '
 'take them on as your own Only by taking time to silence everything else can '
 'you truly determine what is most important to you not what other people tell '
 'you is important but what you believe deep down to be right When you sit '
 'down to play poker play and feel good about it When you study study and feel '
 'good about it Dont worry about what other people think about what youre '
 'doing This is your time not theirs Dont let them steal it from you Focus on '
 'what you can control accept what you cant You control the decisions that you '
 'make when you play You also have control over the decisions you make away '
 'from the table when to play what limits to play how you prepare for and cool '
 'down after your sessions This is what you have power over and what you '
 'should focus on You cannot control the cards and other peoples behavior Dont '
 'waste your time complaining about bad river cards or the guy who doesnt know '
 'how to treat other players If youre thinking about these things youre not '
 'thinking about your main goal and your play will suffer In the end the luck '
 'will balance out but if you spend your energy dwelling on past injustices '
 'you may miss the opportunity to experience ones in your favor Celebrate your '
 'victories however small When you win at something your brain releases '
 'feelgood neurotransmitters that is if you allow yourself to feel good about '
 'it When these chemicals are released it gives you confidence that you can '
 'accomplish more challenging tasks Its like a confidence snowball So reward '
 'yourself with positivity by celebrating all the little things you do right '
 'When you choose a good seat when you make a good play when you read someones '
 'hand correctly even if it doesnt lead to you winning money in this instance '
 'celebrate your victory You can even celebrate victories off the table such '
 'as making someone smile to ingrain this amazingly fruitful habit A winner is '
 'someone who wins something A loser is someone who never wins So if you '
 'happen to be someone caught in a negative thought loop allow yourself to '
 'start winning a little more often and youll transform very quickly Remember '
 'and reaffirm why you love this game and why you love getting better Poker is '
 'a challenging game The cards can be a very cruel mistress It can be '
 'challenging to keep your',
 'head when everything seems to be going wrong despite your best efforts '
 'Realize that all the adversity is simply a test to help you get stronger and '
 'prepare you for the occasion that really matters Its not winlose its '
 'winlearn Poker isnt just about making money Its about developing your mind '
 'and learning to understand other players Once you realize this the losses '
 'will seem much less significant because youll realize that the fluctuations '
 'of your stack do not represent your progress as a player The best athletes '
 'and performers have great coaches and motivators Sometimes a positive voice '
 'is the only thing that can get people through adversity A great poker coach '
 'will help you develop as a player much quicker than you could on your own '
 'But when youre on the felt you have to be your own coach Tell yourself what '
 'you need to hear Take a step outside or go look in the bathroom mirror and '
 'say out loud whats bothering you Then reframe it in a positive way Identify '
 'the problem and offer yourself a solution It may seem a little silly at '
 'first but giving yourself positive affirmations verbally is a great way to '
 'shape yourself the right way Quit comparing yourself to other people One of '
 'the biggest obstacles I see my students face is the fear of taking the first '
 'step because they feel like they are so far behind They watch big buyin '
 'tournaments on TV while playing their regular schedule and constantly think '
 'of the distance between where they are now and where they see other people '
 'Or they hear that the games are tougher so theres no point in studying '
 'Reality check  There is plenty of money up for grabs in the poker world and '
 'always will be Part of being a good poker player is finding games that suit '
 'your strengths and making the most out of them Sure the lineup on High '
 'Stakes Poker or any  game online may look pretty tough but those arent the '
 'games youre playing Reality check  Just because someone else is doing '
 'something doesnt mean that you need to Maybe you have no interest in playing '
 'in Bobbys Room or playing Super High Roller events and thats fine You can '
 'watch these shows to learn or for entertainment but be careful about '
 'comparing yourself to these people They lived a very unique life to get '
 'where they are and you have too Its perfectly fine to have respect for the '
 'players and what theyve accomplished but theres no need to worship them or '
 'think that theyre better than you because theyre on TV Reality check  One '
 'reason players like Phil Hellmuth Phil Ivey and Daniel Negreanu have such '
 'great results is because theyve put in so much time For my younger readers '
 'out there realize that these superstars probably have  years of experience '
 'over you and thus many more years of opportunity to build their resume Even '
 'younger phenoms such as Greg Merson over  million hands played and Daniel '
 'Coleman over  sitngos played put in tons of hours perfecting their craft '
 'before reaching the spotlight If you want to put in the time thats wonderful '
 'but dont feel like you need to go  or theres no point Your goals may be much '
 'more modest than those of the poker celebrities that the masses love to '
 'worship and theres nothing wrong with that',
 'Winning ingredient  time on task I started out by saying that you have to be '
 'reasonable with your expectations and not put too much pressure on yourself '
 'No matter how hard you try youre not going to become a superstar overnight '
 'If you try to do too much in a short period of time you are almost certain '
 'to experience burnout and lose your passion for progress Also if you arent '
 'fully present during your sessions study or play then you arent really '
 'putting in as much time as you think you are Whatever your mind is thinking '
 'about is where you really are so when youre in your dedicated poker time '
 'everything else should be put aside Those things will still be there when '
 'youre finished playing and you can deal with them during your nonpoker time '
 'The only way to sustain motivation and keep your energy levels up is to be '
 'realistic and maintain the other areas of your life Dont let a passion for '
 'poker leave your physical social spiritual and emotional life playing second '
 'fiddle If these areas are suffering your poker game is almost certain to '
 'feel the effects For best results the following process should be applied to '
 'all areas of your life as well as your poker game Time you spend in each of '
 'these areas will have a positive ripple effect on the other areas so you can '
 'feel good about investing in them Identify what sort of progress youd like '
 'to achieve in your game Be specific about what you want and set a reasonable '
 'timeframe for getting it done For example your goal may involve playing a '
 'specific game or it may involve polishing up on a specific topic Whatever it '

 ' LOWER BUYIN TOURNAMENT STRATEGIES Introduction Many poker books focusing on '
 'nolimit holdem tournament strategy offer advice that applies primarily to '
 'bigger buyin tournaments tournaments that might cost  or more to enter But '
 'in reality the majority of poker players dont play those events Most '
 'parttime or recreational players and even a lot of the fulltimers who play '
 'tournaments yearround are focusing more on lower buyin tournaments For these '
 'players  might represent the upper limit of what theyre willing to invest in '
 'a poker tournament As a result most tournament players are sticking with '
 'tournaments such as those you find at World Series of Poker Circuit stops on '
 'the Heartland Poker Tour Hollywood Poker Open events other regional '
 'tournament series and events and even daily tournaments that can cost  or '
 'less to play You can see the problem for these players If they read books '
 'full of advice for playing  buyin events and try to apply that advice in a '
 'daily tourney or some other smaller buyin tournament its very likely they '
 'could experience disastrous results I like to play both bigger events and '
 'also smaller ones and sometimes when playing lower buyin events Ill '
 'encounter opponents who are more used to playing primarily bigger '
 'tournaments Many of these players are excellent at poker and think at a high '
 'level but in the context of the lower buyin tournament theyll sometimes '
 'outthink themselves By applying more advanced concepts theyll work '
 'themselves into strange spots where suddenly theyre allin with  versus a '
 'blatantly straightforward players AA They thought that after exchanging '
 'several preflop raises they were engaging in a leveling war with an opponent '
 'but  of the time that kind of thinking usually isnt appropriate in a lower '
 'buyin tournament The player who has  them isnt Bertrand ElkY Grospellier '
 'making a move with rags hes a typical player in lower buyin tournaments who '
 'is going to have the goods There are certain strategic approaches that can '
 'work well in lower buyin tournaments and in many cases they arent the same '
 'approaches that are necessary to succeed in bigger events What follows in '
 'this chapter are strategies that Ive found effective in lower buyin events '
 'These are tournaments where you can encounter some sophisticated opponents '
 'although on the whole youre more likely to find players with relatively '
 'little experience and skills In some ways these tournaments remind me a '
 'little of what poker was like when I first got into the game as though '
 'playing in them is like getting into a time machine and traveling back a '
 'decade when tournament strategy in general wasnt nearly as advanced as it is '
 'today Thats not to say being successful in lower buyin tournaments is easy '
 'But by taking these ideas into account youre more likely to give yourself a '
 'chance to succeed in them Along the way Ill also be making reference to '
 'particular ways bigger buyin tournaments play differently which should help '
 'those players already versed in lower buyin tournament strategy learn what '
 'to expect when they decide to take a shot in a higher buyin event Finally '
 'after discussing different types of lower buyin tournaments and',
 'strategies applicable to each Ill discuss how playing the same hand either '
 'early or late in each of these tournaments can require different approaches '
 'Lower buyin tournament types Even within the category of lower buyin '
 'tournaments there are distinctions worth considering On the whole all of '
 'these tournaments have a great deal in common with the fields often '
 'comprised of players fitting a similar profile and skill level That said '
 'there are differences between what youll encounter in a WSOP Circuit Main '
 'Event and your local casinos daily noon tourney Daily tournaments By daily '
 'tournaments Im referring to the lowest buyin tournaments out there the kind '
 'of tourneys nearly all poker rooms feature that can have buyins of   even  '
 'or  and which often only attract a few tables worth of players They usually '
 'run every single day and sometimes find the same players showing up day '
 'after day at a given casino Structures for daily tournaments are often '
 'extremely fast designed to finish in just a few hours They are intended to '
 'get players in the door and playing but then quickly moving over to the cash '
 'games which tend to earn the rooms more revenue than do tournaments Even so '
 'these daily tournaments can often feature exorbitant fees in proportion to '
 'the buyin For example a  tournament might have  or  rake attached to it a '
 'much higher percentage than you normally encounter in tournaments with '
 'bigger buyins Incidentally make a point to keep an eye out for poker rooms '
 'that advertise their rakes when advertising their daily tournaments These '
 'are often going to be fairly competitive and offer better deals Fields in '
 'these tournaments are often the softest youll find although it can be hard '
 'to beat daily tourneys due to the fast structures and high rakes For the '
 'most part players will have limited tournament skills even those who play '
 'these events regularly An average field size is probably going to be about  '
 'players with a first prize being perhaps a few hundred dollars Small buyin '
 'events without guaranteed prize pools Here Im referring to tournaments that '
 'might cost as little as  to play and which can sometimes produce decentsized '
 'fields but more often than not feature smaller turnouts of  players or fewer '
 'Here Ill also include events with larger entry fees such as an HPO Regional '
 'Main Event with a  buyin although again with no guarantee attached These '
 'will be tournaments featuring primarily local players with very few pros '
 'flying in to play Small buyin events with guaranteed prize pools Prize pool '
 'guarantees can attract bigger fields as well as encourage players to endure '
 'having to travel great distances in order to play A tournament with a  buyin '
 'that has a  guarantee attached to it would fall in this category as would '
 'other similar events WSOP Circuit events including low buy in preliminary '
 'tournaments dont have guarantees but they do have the allure of a WSOPC ring '
 'which can still attract bigger turnouts including some professionals to play '
 'Depending on the location andor how busy the tournament calendar is '
 'tournaments in this category can attract  players or even',
 'more The divisions arent cutanddried and you could certainly argue for '
 'places where they overlap But it makes sense to think of these three levels '
 'of lower buyin tournaments as having certain differences worth keeping in '
 'mind while we might generally refer to all three as comprising the minor '
 'leagues of poker tournaments not unlike TripleA DoubleA and SingleA leagues '
 'in baseball Strategies for daily tournaments Given both the fast structure '
 'and typical skill level of opponents in daily tournaments there is usually '
 'little need to engage in a lot of intense player analysis While there often '
 'isnt enough time to construct reliable reads on players the fact is that '
 'most players in these tournaments are going to exhibit a lot of the same '
 'tendencies which makes targeting individual players less of a priority Most '
 'will be recreational players and most will fall into very predictable '
 'patterns Differences between bigger buyin events and daily tournaments '
 'become noticeable right from the first hand For one thing people generally '
 'dont register late for the daily tournaments because the fast structures '
 'make doing so such a bad idea Theres a reason Phil Hellmuth is always '
 'showing up six levels into the events he plays because usually the '
 'structures are slow enough to make missing early preante lowblind levels '
 'less of a concern Also in bigger buyin tournaments the level of play is high '
 'enough now that the early levels have become much less meaningful than was '
 'the case back during the boom years of  You used to find a lot of wild play '
 'during these early levels with players willing to stack off for several '
 'hundred big blinds after flopping top pair Thats much less common in  buyin '
 'events today making showing up late a reasonable option for many pros Those '
 'who do show up for the first level of a  event generally play very snug '
 'rarely if ever committing many chips without having made big hands Small '
 'suited connectors and small pocket pairs are great to play during these '
 'early levels and in fact can be more valuable than AQ AJ or even big premium '
 'pairs like aces and kings unless you can find a way to commit your entire '
 'stack with them before the flop In lower buyin tournaments and especially in '
 'daily tournaments youll see players playing every single hand from the very '
 'start They will limp in with any two cards In fact its not uncommon to see '
 'the action go limplimplimplimp then a raise then callcallcallcall all the '
 'way around the table That too is hugely different from what you encounter in '
 'bigger buyin tournaments where preflop limping almost never happens and only '
 'very rarely will a raise elicit multiple callers before the flop This '
 'preflop behavior with lots of limps and calls before the flop can be '
 'witnessed in our other two subcategories of lower buyin events as well Even '
 'in some  buyin events Ill come in with raises frequently and encounter '
 'players complaining in response that Im raising too often Thats because what '
 'Im doing is atypical In bigger buyin tournaments once the antes kick in '
 'youll see players open up their games and become more aggressive a strategic '
 'shift youve seen described before if youve read other tournament strategy '
 'books However in daily tournaments the exact opposite often takes place once '
 'the tournament moves out of that early stage once the antes are introduced '
 'Players go from playing every single hand to shutting down entirely becoming '
 'tighter as the blinds and antes increase It wont happen right away When the '
 'blinds are  with a  ante youll still see some splashing around as before But '
 'when the blinds reach perhaps  with a  ante thats when players start folding '
 'to those opening raises even minraises to  At that stage if a regular small '
 'stakes player ',
 'bets before the flop he or she almost certainly holds one of four possible '
 'hands AA KK QQ or A K Again what Im describing is much different from what '
 'happens in a  tournament and indeed this will be the juncture in a lower '
 'buyin event that the pro more used to dealing with multilevel thinkers '
 'sometimes runs into trouble In big buyin events players  and  constantly '
 'before the flop both to take the initiative away from their opponents and '
 'also to cap their opponents ranges The player calling a  or  in those events '
 'generally wont be stronger than JJ that is wont have a hand with which to '
 'reraise back which helps a lot when it comes to narrowing hand ranges after '
 'the flop But back in the daily tournament or other lower buyin events light  '
 'and other fancy plays simply dont work since the player doing the  is going '
 'to be so strong Again we might think of these lower buyin tournaments as '
 'reprising  poker when reraising before the flop so severely narrowed players '
 'ranges and when a  always meant AA or KK Now when players do call your '
 'preflop raise in a daily tournament which will frequently happen theyre also '
 'capping their range You wont have to worry about them having AA or KK '
 'although once in a while you will run into a player who absolutely never '
 'reraises preflop no matter what I cant begin to tell you how many camps Ive '
 'taught in which students exhibit this exact behavior becoming so tight in '
 'the middle stage of a tournament that narrowing the range of their possible '
 'holdings becomes a relatively trivial task Ill say to them over and over how '
 'its okay to go broke with a hand worse than pocket aces Ill insist its even '
 'okay to make a move once in a while In the labs theyll follow my advice '
 'proudly showing when theyve done something like reraise with rags or made '
 'some other unorthodox play Then they get into a tournament and they simply '
 'cannot pull the trigger when theres real money on the line In daily '
 'tournaments and in the majority of lower buyin events most players refuse to '
 'give themselves permission to go broke with less than a premium starting '
 'hand A good strategy then once the antes come into play is to begin '
 'minraising before the flop continuation bet afterwards and fold when faced '
 'with significant aggression By adopting this straightforward approach youll '
 'soon discover your opponents pretty much telling you what they have by how '
 'they respond If you pay attention early in the tournament youll learn who '
 'raises the flop with top pair who raises with two pair or better and who '
 'raises or calls with draws Those tendencies are likely to remain the same '
 'later so when you are met with resistance to your preflop opens or '
 'continuation bets later youll know whether to fold People do bluff in these '
 'tournaments but the times when they do so are usually limited to a couple of '
 'specific instances Firstly on the turn after you have checked back the flop '
 'rather than continuation bet Secondly if you continuation bet the flop and '
 'then check back the turn theyll bluff the river Its very rare to run into '
 'players in these tournaments who checkraise the flop or turn as a bluff '
 'Usually a checkraise is an unambiguous signal that your opponent has a '
 'strong hand Meanwhile when players bet into you from out of position after '
 'having called your preflop opening raise they are also usually strong Again '
 'watch for patterns early on associated with these moves as players generally '
 'dont change from their usual habits in these situations later The great '
 'majority of players in these events play very ABC betting or raising when '
 'they have a strong hand and checking or folding when they dont They are not '
 'going to be very deceptive They will try to steal your blinds and antes '
 'occasionally but usually only if youve shown weakness On the other',
 'try to steal your blinds and antes occasionally but usually only if youve '
 'shown weakness On the other hand in  events checkraise bluffing and making '
 'other creative plays are needed both to balance your range and to deceive '
 'your opponents There youre running into players who are thirdlevel thinkers '
 'and above but almost everyone you face in lower buyin tournaments is going '
 'to be either first level focused only on their own hole cards or secondlevel '
 'focused also on your hand Players in daily tournaments and other lower buyin '
 'events will not be coming back over the top of you with  on',
 'an  flop It just is not going to happen However that is always going to be a '
 'possibility in a higher buyin prolevel event One other useful strategy in '
 'small tournaments is just to call your opponents raises before the flop I '
 'actually dont  a great deal in the smaller events Youll find that for a lot '
 'of players in these tournaments once they have raised before the flop will '
 'call a lot of  even with fairly suspect hands just because they have already '
 'committed chips and cant bring themselves to fold without seeing a flop If I '
 'do  then it is generally only for value not as a bluff or to take action '
 'away because people will call reraises with hands like  or  from out of '
 'position the kind of thing that is a disastrous play in any tournament '
 'Calling preflop raises with position then allows you to take advantage of '
 'your opponents straightforward play after the flop When the flop comes and '
 'they hit top pair for instance they have an extremely hard time letting go '
 'which makes it relatively easy for you to decide what to do in response If '
 'you manage to make something better than top pair and you see your opponent '
 'calling your postflop bets or raises youre in a position to go for extreme '
 'value increasing the betsizing liberally knowing your opponent is not going '
 'to fold Small buyin events without guaranteed prize pools Most of what I '
 'describe above with regard to daily tournaments will still apply once you '
 'find yourself in tournaments with higher buyins say  up to  that dont '
 'feature guarantees and thus usually will have smaller fields and not a lot '
 'of pros traveling to them to play Even so there are a few additional ideas '
 'that come into play once you move from the daily tournaments to these '
 'slightly larger events One big difference is the need to devote some effort '
 'to player profiling By that I mean youll have to move away from assuming '
 'nearly everyone plays in a certain way as you can largely get away with in '
 'the daily tournaments and start paying closer attention to how each player '
 'is playing then develop strategies that are suited to counter each player In '
 'daily tournaments such efforts are mostly wasted for two reasons Firstly '
 'most of the players that you are likely to encounter play a very similar '
 'style most are the same player really just in different skins Secondly the '
 'rapid structures dont really make it worthwhile to start developing more '
 'nuanced profiles of individual players But in these small buyin tournaments '
 'with nonguaranteed prize pools the kind of tournaments Ill sometimes refer '
 'to as regional tournaments youre often going to encounter some more '
 'creativity from players around the table thus making it necessary to pay '
 'closer attention to what each player is doing and adapt accordingly The '
 'minraise plus continuation bet rinse and repeat formula that often will get '
 'you deep in a daily tournament cant be practiced as easily here because of '
 'the greater variety of player types and skill levels youll be facing Some of '
 'these players will be more advanced and sophisticated and also more '
 'aggressive so youll need to sort out early on which opponents are more savvy '
 'and which are less so The business of profiling players obviously requires '
 'watching how they play their hands but for me that work often begins even '
 'before the first hand is dealt Youd be surprised how much you can learn '
 'about players especially in these smaller buyin tournaments just by their '
 'appearance and how they communicate with you or others at the table For '
 'example if I see a player at such an event who is carrying a backpack that '
 'immediately suggests to me the player has at least some experience likely '
 'more than the average player Players with backpacks know that by playing a '
 'tournament they might be in the poker room all day and so have come prepared '
 'for',
 'that eventuality by bringing snacks and other needed items In the mental '
 'tally I start making right away before a tournament begins Ill give those '
 'players a  in the experience column and give them credit for being a little '
 'more advanced than others Then of course Ill pay attention to how they play '
 'hands during the first couple of levels to see if they confirm that early '
 'expectation Ive made of them Ill look also at how players are dressed for '
 'the tournament Sometimes a player wearing a flashy Rolex watch or something '
 'similarly conspicuous is going to be looser or less disciplined as a player '
 'This will also happen in higher buyin events now and then At these regional '
 'tournaments youll also occasionally find players who will signal to you just '
 'by what they are wearing that they are a local For example I was recently in '
 'a tournament in Columbus where I saw several Ohio State jerseys which made '
 'it relatively easy to assume those players hadnt traveled very far to play '
 'the event Meanwhile if I see a player wearing an Ohio State jersey at a '
 'tournament down in Florida I wont make such an assumption In fact Ill be '
 'curious to find out from that player if indeed hes traveled some distance '
 'just to play the event Did he come because of the value he perceived the '
 'tournament as having for him Was it just because his buddies live there and '
 'he happened to be visiting That leads to another strategy Ill often employ '
 'when first starting to try to build profiles of individual players in such '
 'tournaments I simply talk to them Its amazing how much you can learn about '
 'someones background and relative skill level just by talking to him '
 'especially before a tournament starts when everyones defenses are still down '
 'and the likelihood of not being truthful is much less I love to engage '
 'players before a tournament begins both because Im a social guy and like to '
 'be friendly but also because of how valuable that information can be once '
 'the cards go in the air Recently I was playing in a Hollywood Poker Open '
 'tournament where before play began I struck up a conversation with the '
 'player sitting to my left Its always beneficial to try to get to know '
 'players seated in close proximity to you especially those on your left who '
 'will be acting after you on most hands I always make it a point to learn '
 'these players names at the very least and hopefully much more about them if '
 'I can possibly do so If you know someones name you can look up his poker '
 'results using your phone Anyhow at this HPO tournament I found myself '
 'chatting with this young fellow on my left just making idle conversation '
 'while trying to get an idea about his experience He told me about how he '
 'works in construction and plays poker on the weekend with friends going on '
 'to explain how hed heard about this particular tournament and had saved up '
 'some money to come play it While we were talking an elderly woman sits down '
 'on my right someone who just happened to have attended one of my poker camps '
 'in the past She listened to our conversation for a while and then she leaned '
 'forward to interrupt us Excuse me she said and then looked at the young man '
 'with whom I was speaking Please dont talk to him anymore she said All hes '
 'doing is trying to find information about you hes not being nice Hes just '
 'pretending to be your friend so he can bust you I had to laugh as she went '
 'on to explain how shed been in my poker camp and so knew what I was up to '
 'And sure enough the guy didnt say another word to me Getting called out like '
 'that is rare of course More often than not youll find that players will '
 'gladly open up to you even after play begins sometimes letting you know in '
 'various ways whether they are seasoned tournament players or relative '
 'newcomers Knowing for instance that a player only occasionally plays  '
 'nolimit holdem cash games and few tournaments youll find it easier to blow',
 'seasoned tournament players or relative newcomers Knowing for instance that '
 'a player only occasionally plays  nolimit holdem cash games and few '
 'tournaments youll find it easier to blow that player off hands compared to '
 'more seasoned players On the other hand if youre able to learn that a player '
 'is a tourney grinder who isnt just there to make Day  youre going to know '
 'you cant just run him over You dont have to ask pointed questions about how '
 'long your opponents have played poker or what their typical buyins are Just '
 'ask where they are from what their occupation is or hobbies are or other '
 'questions about their background and as they answer listen for how they are '
 'telling you often in surprisingly direct ways all about their poker r√©sum√© '
 'People love talking about themselves and if you',
 'show interest in what theyre saying they love it even more Ill add one more '
 'point with regard to table talk one that applies especially to these kinds '
 'of events but is also often meaningful in just about any pokerrelated '
 'context You can learn a lot about how someone plays by hearing him or her '
 'tell a bad beat story I dislike hearing bad beat stories as much as the next '
 'person but if Im in a tournament and someone sitting on my left wants to '
 'tell me about a bad beat he took Im all ears Players who tell bad beat '
 'stories are almost always selective with the details they share but '
 'sometimes you can tell theyre leaving out certain crucial information '
 'because it just isnt important to them Im referring to details like stack '
 'sizes or effective stack sizes position at the table or even the order of '
 'the action If their pocket aces got cracked and that alone is the main point '
 'of the whole story for them listen up they might also be telling you how '
 'they play hands besides pocket aces including how they play them badly With '
 'just a little bit of pregame work profiling then even as the first hand is '
 'being dealt you should already have some thoughts about everyone sitting '
 'around the table including being able to put them tentatively into the '
 'categories of more experienced and less experienced Then once the first  '
 'hands have been dealt you should be able to confirm or revise your initial '
 'reads as well as pick up additional more particular information about each '
 'player based on how they play When profiling players according to their '
 'actions during the first couple of levels of a low buyin tournament there is '
 'one very obvious indicator to watch for whether a player ever openlimps When '
 'action folds to someone and that player limps in Ill immediately consider '
 'him to be an unskilled player In the bigger buyin events openlimping almost '
 'never happens Everyone comes in with a raise if given the option Theres '
 'obviously a reason for that Limping rather than folding or raising is almost '
 'always the least EV play of the three options available to you However in '
 'lower buyin events youll see players openlimp quite frequently You will see '
 'limping even more in the daily tournaments than in small buyin tournaments '
 'with or without guarantees but even in the latter it will happen enough to '
 'make it worth noticing When players openlimp Ill immediately place them in '
 'the recreational category and from there often be able to predict how theyll '
 'play for the rest of their day Ill continue to watch them carefully noting '
 'other tendencies Ill watch to see whether or not they are capable of folding '
 'thus letting me know if I can bluff them or if I should stick primarily with '
 'betting for value Ill also watch to see whether or not they are scared money '
 'playing only premium hands meaning blowing them off hands is not going to be '
 'difficult on scary flops After watching just a couple of hands with these '
 'players you can often safely put them into one of two subcategories Firstly '
 'the unbluffable players who cannot fold after making a decent hand Secondly '
 'the easily bluffable players who dont understand that it really is difficult '
 'to make a pair in nolimit holdem During his recent WSOP Main Event '
 'commentary Antonio Esfandiari earned some razzing for saying so many times '
 'how tough it is to make a pair in nolimit holdem But he is absolutely right '
 'and thats why continuation betting and aggression is so important By the end '
 'of a couple of orbits you should have already worked out who the weaker '
 'players are and further worked on placing some or all of them into these '
 'subcategories Meanwhile also pay attention to the stronger players the ones '
 'who understand that aggression is needed to win Youre watching to see who is '
 'most active who is  who is capable of checkraising or making other '
 'nonpassive plays',
 'who is most active who is  who is capable of checkraising or making other '
 'nonpassive plays and so on Those players arent going to be as easily slotted '
 'into large simple categories but youre still going to be able to add '
 'considerably to your understanding of each of them just by watching and '
 'remembering their actions from the start During that first halfhour when '
 'playing one of these regional events I tend to play a very snug game mostly '
 'watching others and not getting involved too frequently By the end of that '
 'period I usually have a',
 'good idea about how every one of my opponents plays which can obviously make '
 'it easier to make decisions once I get involved in pots against them Small '
 'buyin events with guaranteed prize pools When you move over into lower buyin '
 'tournaments that have guarantees attached to them the challenges you can '
 'expect to face increase as well Remember that under this heading Im also '
 'putting WSOP Circuit events which wont have guarantees but which do attract '
 'similar fields that include fulltime players and pros chasing rings The kind '
 'of player profiling Im recommending you perform in small buyin tournaments '
 'without guarantees is not likely to be as simple to perform in these events '
 'where you have a mix of pros and other experienced players scattered '
 'throughout the field Such players are always trying to mask their intentions '
 'and play very creatively making it difficult to conclude what their '
 'tendencies are or how to categorize them even when youve seen them play '
 'several hands Youll still be able to sort out who the pros are from the rest '
 'again following various cues including their appearance how they conduct '
 'themselves at the table and how aggressive and active they are But chances '
 'are you wont be able to learn too much more about them until after the '
 'tournament moves beyond its initial stage Youll notice that early in '
 'tournaments many of these grinders adopt a fairly standard approach mixing '
 'it up occasionally with small bluffs and small value bets but never '
 'committing too many chips unless they have a strong hand and have trapped a '
 'recreational player who cant let go of his obviously secondbest holding But '
 'for the most part these experienced players are going to wait until the '
 'antes kick in before breaking out into a more individual style of play In '
 'this way small buyin tourneys with guarantees tend to play a lot like  or  '
 'events where youll also see a lot of cautious play and little information '
 'being made available during the early levels before the antes kick in Also '
 'like in the bigger buyin events once the antes do come in the smaller buyin '
 'events with guarantees the play is going to change markedly The grinders '
 'will start opening their ranges while the recreational players will start '
 'tightening theirs At that point I am devoting a lot more of my mental energy '
 'towards figuring out what the pros are doing rather than worrying about the '
 'amateurs Among the latter group I will usually already have a good idea who '
 'is bluffable and who is not who are more aggressive and who are more passive '
 'and so on Meanwhile among the grinders the real study of them comes after '
 'the antes arrive and they begin to distinguish themselves by their '
 'individual styles One other very useful detail worth noting about all '
 'players in these events is their betsizing The regular players or grinders '
 'are always very deliberate about their betsizing often following very '
 'standard formulas For example these players preflop opening raises might be '
 'as much as  early in the tournament  in the middle and then  late They have '
 'it down to a science They will also not vary their betsizing based on their '
 'hands but rather based on board texture their position andor their opponents '
 'They also remain very aware of how to mix up the sizes of their bets in '
 'order to remain balanced and not give away information about their hand '
 'strength by how much they are putting in the pot Meanwhile players with less '
 'experience will give away a great deal of information about their hands with '
 'their bet sizes including in these small buyin tourneys with guarantees '
 'Youll see players routinely opening with raises well above what would be '
 'considered standard such as a  opening raise Then after earning folds theyll '
 'sometimes show their pocket aces proudly saying Last time I slow played them '
 'they got cracked This may seem like the most obvious tell imaginable but the '
 'fact is that',
 'played them they got cracked This may seem like the most obvious tell '
 'imaginable but the fact is that it happens constantly in lower buyin '
 'tournaments Big bets mean big hands If the player is showing a ton',
 'of aggression with big bets or raises more often than not the player is very '
 'strong There is a flip side to this Lets say its the  level and a '
 'recreational player raises to  You call with AQ and the flop comes  Your '
 'opponent continues with a potsized bet You can often assume the player '
 'either has connected with AK or has JJ or something similar In either case '
 'youre obviously behind your opponents made hand How you proceed depends on '
 'what youve learned about the player up to that point specifically whether or '
 'not you can bluff them off a hand If you think he will fold a marginal K or '
 'JJ to a raise you should probably raise If he will never muck such a hand '
 'you can make an easy fold More often than not these players are betting '
 'primarily based on what they perceive to be the value of their hand and not '
 'considering other factors including position how you play or even what you '
 'might have Not being as concerned about these other factors they telegraph '
 'their hand strength via their bet sizes One thing Ill do in lower buyin '
 'tournaments that I essentially never do in tournaments where the buy in is  '
 'or more is to show my hand Players in these events respond in interesting '
 'ways when you show your hand or even just show one card Often they will '
 'reciprocate by showing you their hand giving you a lot of free information '
 'Say I have AQ and raised before the flop getting one caller The flop comes '
 'jackhigh and my opponent fires a big bet into me Ill fold showing him just '
 'my ace Quite often hell proudly turn over his QJ or  Think about how much '
 'more information hes given me than I have given him in that exchange Of '
 'course I will not show bluffs or other hands that let my opponents know Ive '
 'outplayed them or bullied them out of a hand Some players in these lower '
 'buyin tournaments can become sensitive to such tactics and if they think '
 'someone has targeted them they can sometimes make things personal going '
 'forward Once that happens all of your reads and everything youve been '
 'working on goes out the window because theyll start playing differently '
 'against you than they do against others Occasionally that might work out '
 'well if they overplay a marginal made hand against you but on the whole it '
 'is a negative to have someone gunning for you this way especially if you '
 'arent sure if he is actually gunning for you Its much better when your '
 'opponents play consistently against everyone because that makes it easier to '
 'read them Hand examples The following hands illustrate the differences '
 'between low and high buyin tournaments There will be two hands presented '
 'with the same cards and stack sizes with both hands being played out in a '
 'low buyin event then a high buyin event They present a fair depiction of how '
 'the game is played differently at each level Hand  low buyin This is the '
 'first hand of a low buyin event This is not a reentry event Everyone has a  '
 'stack The blinds are  The player in first position calls  with A  Second '
 'position calls with K  Third position calls with Q  Fourth position decides '
 'to show some discipline and folds   The lojack calls with   The hijack '
 'raises to  with   The cutoff calls with   The button calls with J  The small '
 'blind folds   The big blind calls  more with   All of the limpers call  more '
 'making the pot ',
 'In lower buyin events you will find that players are prone to entering the '
 'pot with numerous hands that they think have potential Most players enter '
 'the pot by calling rather than raising and when facing a preflop raise they '
 'will call citing their pot odds It is worth noting that the hijacks raise '
 'to  is quite large but in small buyin events where your opponents will call '
 'any raise that is not huge raising fairly large is a reasonable play because '
 'it will extract additional value The flop comes Q   The pot is  Everyone '
 'checks to third position who bets  with his Q  The lojack calls with his   '
 'The hijack makes a good fold with his   The cutoff folds his gutshot The '
 'button calls with his J  Everyone else folds The pot is now  Many times in '
 'the small buyins players will bet into the preflop raiser like third '
 'position did with weak to mediumstrength holdings You will find that these '
 'leads are usually a marginal made hand such as top pair with a bad kicker or '
 'middle pair with a good kicker Most players are playing fit or fold and will '
 'simply give up whenever they miss on the flop It is important to realize '
 'that the fit or fold strategy is often correct at these levels because so '
 'many players see a flop When many players see a flop someone is likely to '
 'flop a reasonably strong hand Bluffing is not a good idea during the early '
 'levels in these tournaments because players are more likely to call down '
 'with marginal made hands You will also find that if someone has a very '
 'strong hand such as two pair or better they are likely to try for a '
 'checkraise Many times the bet size is very indicative of the bettors hand '
 'strength For example this  bet is usually indicative of a weak top pair type '
 'hand whereas a hand like AQ may bet closer to  or half the pot Many players '
 'at this level have a hard time folding pairs especially pocket pairs As long '
 'as the bet sizes stay within reason they will usually find a call Facing a '
 'bet and a call on the flop it is probably smart to fold hands such as pocket '
 'pairs as the lojack did with  and even marginal made hands such as J  Notice '
 'that the button often has some reverse implied odds because if he improves '
 'to two pair or trips he may not get paid off and he could easily be '
 'dominated resulting in him losing a large pot The turn is the Q    The pot '
 'is  Third position again bets  Both the lojack and the button call The pot '
 'is now  The player who bet out on the flop will often lead again on the turn '
 'when a safe card comes and will check when a scare card such as an A or K '
 'comes For some reason many recreational players will bet the same amount on '
 'the turn as they did on the flop This is usually an obvious giveaway that '
 'they are concerned that their hand could be beat However this does not mean '
 'they will fold to aggression It is worth noting that very few recreational '
 'players will checkraise in this spot as a bluff A  bet on the turn is very '
 'small compared to the  pot When facing such a tiny bet it is usually okay to '
 'continue calling when you think you have some outs Even though the lojack '
 'and button probably assume they are behind at the moment they should call at '
 'this point due to their big pot odds If they had reason to believe that '
 'third position would fold to a raise raising becomes a strong play As stated '
 'earlier though it is tough to make weak opponents fold when they have a hand '
 'they think is decent making raising quite speculative The river is the Q    '
 'A The pot is  Everyone checks giving third position the  pot The ace is an '
 'interesting river card not because it connects with any of the players hands '
 'but because of the fact that all recreational players are aware of that card '
 'While none of the players should have an',
 'of the fact that all recreational players are aware of that card While none '
 'of the players should have an ace too often most players will fold to any '
 'reasonable amount of aggression when the card they perceive to be the '
 'scariest falls on the river That being said you will find that if someone '
 'happens to have a',
 'marginal A such as A  that somehow floated the flop they would likely not '
 'value bet on the river You will find that most small buyin players are '
 'afraid to bet with nonnut hands for value on the river especially in '
 'multiway pots While it is difficult to say if third position would fold when '
 'facing a river bet do not be shocked if he makes a hero call simply because '
 'he thinks he has a good hand Always pay attention to the way your opponents '
 'play before deciding to attempt a risky bluff Hand  high buyin The player in '
 'first position folds with A  Second position also folds K  Third position '
 'folds his Q  Fourth position folds   The lojack raises to  with   The hijack '
 'calls with   The cutoff calls with   The button calls with J  The small '
 'blind folds   and the big blind folds   The pot is  In high stakes '
 'tournaments most players are positionally aware meaning they know to fold '
 'most of their marginal holdings from early position because it is too likely '
 'that someone yet to act has a strong hand Compared to the small stakes '
 'example this results in the initial preflop raise size being much smaller  '
 'compared to  Once there is a small initial raise when stacks are deep you '
 'should expect most players to call with any sort of hand that has reasonable '
 'postflop potential The flop comes  The pot is  Everyone checks to the button '
 'who bets  with his middle pair Only the hijack and cutoff call The pot is  '
 'With four players seeing the flop the initial raiser is correct to check '
 'bottom pair because it is simply too likely that someone yet to act has a '
 'better pair Some players would bet with  others would pot control by '
 'checking and calling The button made an excellent bet both for value and to '
 'protect his hand from various overcards such as  that have decent equity '
 'versus his middle pair In general when you see flop action like this a '
 'strong play is to checkraise the last position bettor with a wide range '
 'because most players in last position will at least consider taking a stab '
 'at the flop with a wide range because everyone else showed weakness If you '
 'pick your spots well you will be able to steal this pot a huge percentage of '
 'the time Getting excellent pot odds plus implied odds the cutoff called in '
 'hopes of getting lucky and hitting his gutshot straight draw or turning more '
 'outs The turn is the Q    The pot is  Lojack and hijack check The cutoff '
 'bets  Everyone folds giving the cutoff the pot The turn card doesnt change '
 'much for anyone besides the cutoff who drastically improved his draw He '
 'decided to bet which may or may not be a good play depending on what he '
 'thinks about the buttons flop betting range If he expects the button to bet '
 'the flop with a wide range leading on the turn will often force him to fold '
 'unless he has top pair or better Since the hijack didnt show much interest '
 'on the flop he probably also has a marginal hand By betting into his '
 'opponents he gives himself a chance to steal the pot on the turn and also '
 'builds a pot that he may be able to win on the river by either improving or '
 'bluffing When the cutoff leads on the turn skilled players will assume that '
 'the leader improved either to a premium made hand or a premium draw Either '
 'way both the buttons middle pair and the hijacks  are in marginal shape Both '
 'players made good folds even though they folded the best hand this time '
 'Hand  low buyin This hand takes place much later in the tournament once '
 'antes have been introduced and the blinds have become significant compared '
 'to the starting stacks The blinds are ',
 'First position calls  out of his  stack with Q J Second position raises to  '
 'out of his  stack with   Third position and the lojack both fold junky hands '
 'The hijack with  calls  with   The cutoff and button fold The small blind '
 'calls  more out of his  stack with   The big blind folds and first position '
 'calls  more The pot is  It is not uncommon to see players continue to limp '
 'with a wide range of marginal hands Especially with only a  stack first '
 'position should fold his Q J because it is too likely that someone yet to '
 'act will have him in bad shape Limping especially with a marginal hand is '
 'generally not considered a good play Second position makes a good raise to  '
 'for value given he probably knows that first position likes to limp with a '
 'wide range The hijack makes a loose call with a suited connector First '
 'positions call of the raise with Broadway cards in early position is another '
 'common thing you will see in these tournaments Players at this level many '
 'times do not pay attention to position or effective stack sizes Once they '
 'limp they tend to see a flop The small blind should have strictly a push or '
 'fold decision due to his  stack size but in the lower buyin events you '
 'routinely see players calling with hands like these to set mine with small '
 'effective stacks sizes only to fold when they miss their set When you are '
 'not getting at least  implied odds you should not set mine Either play your '
 'pairs purely for value by going allin or fold if you think you are in bad '
 'shape against your opponents ranges The flop comes A   The pot is  Everyone '
 'checks The flop is does not connect with any of the hands that saw the flop '
 'You will often find that players simply check when they flop poorly Most of '
 'the time there is nothing wrong with this strategy because when many players '
 'see the flop often someone will have a decently strong hand and will not '
 'fold to small amounts of aggression The turn is the A   J The pot is  The '
 'small blind and first position check Second position decides to bet  into '
 'the  pot The hijack and small blind fold First position decides to call '
 'leaving him with  in his stack The pot is now  The turn gives first position '
 'a pair and straight draw as well as the best hand but he probably recognizes '
 'that his hand is beat by any value hand that would be betting and is only '
 'good as a bluff catcher After being checked to for the second time second '
 'position decides to turn his hand into a bluff This is a routine play at '
 'this level You can capitalize on this play by checking an ace two times when '
 'you are out of position giving your opponents plenty of room to make a '
 'mistake Especially when facing a tiny bet while getting amazing pot odds '
 'first position simply cannot fold The river is the A   J  The pot is now  '
 'First position checks second position bets  first position calls While '
 'bluffing the river has some merit for second position his bet is too small '
 'to be successful Most of the time first position will have either a J or  '
 'and will be unwilling to fold it to a small bet However if he put first '
 'position allin for his  he would have had some chance to steal the pot As '
 'played he handed first position  with a poorly executed bluff Hand  high '
 'buyin First position folds his Q J Second position raises to  out of his  '
 'stack with   Everyone folds to the hijack   who reraises to  out of his  '
 'stack Only second position calls Notice that the small blind folded his   '
 'The pot is ',
 'You will find that skilled players grasp the concept that hand values change '
 'significantly based on position and the betting action which is why first '
 'position folded his Q J and why the small blind folded his  Players in high '
 'buyin events rarely limp from any position and will fold most non premium '
 'hands when facing a raise and a reraise It is quite common to see players '
 'raise and reraise with most of their playable hands before the flop in these '
 'events Notice that when second position is facing a reraise to  he should '
 'usually call instead of  If he  to any reasonable amount perhaps  and the '
 'hijack calls then second position will be in a rough spot unless he improves '
 'to a set on the flop Even if he flops an overpair he will have to worry '
 'about his opponent having a set or a bigger overpair If the hijack decides '
 'to  preflop second position will also be in a tough spot where he will '
 'usually have to fold Of course if second position only calls the  more he '
 'will often have to checkfold the flop when he flops poorly allowing the '
 'hijack to occasionally steal the pot but it is worth the risk of getting '
 'bluffed out of a small pot to avoid the possibility of playing a huge pot '
 'with a hand that could easily be crushed The flop comes A   The pot is  '
 'Second position checks the hijack bets  into the  pot and second position '
 'folds This betting line from the hijack is quite standard in high buyin '
 'games In situations where your opponent either has a hand he will not fold '
 'to any bet or a marginal or junky hand that he will fold to almost any bet '
 'it is usually best to make a small continuation bet with your entire range '
 'With your best hands you want to keep your opponent in and when you have '
 'nothing you want to get off as cheaply as possible when your bluff fails '
 'Notice that if second position doesnt have a  or better he will almost '
 'certainly fold to any bet This allows the hijack to make a cheap stab at the '
 'pot that will work a lot of the time I hope this chapter has given you some '
 'tools that will help you succeed at buyins of all levels Especially if you '
 'are used to playing large or medium buyin events when you go back and play '
 'smaller events you will probably feel like you traveled back in time '

 ' SEVEN SIMPLE STEPS TO MOVING UP IN STAKES AND STAYING THERE Introduction '
 'Poker is a peculiar game unlike any other Among traditional casino games it '
 'is unique because the game changes fundamentally as you move to higher '
 'stakes This is not so in other games Blackjack for instance is identical in '
 'strategy and the play of hands for the  and  per hand player The same can be '
 'said for craps roulette baccarat and other games While betting big on sports '
 'can move the market against you the exact same methodology that you use to '
 'win at high stakes can be used equally well at any lower stakes Though '
 'certain sports betting strategies are available to the small player that '
 'cannot be used by the big one Comparing poker instead to strategy games it '
 'is again unique Say you play backgammon for example You can use the same '
 'approach against a club player and then against a much stronger player You '
 'will win less often against the stronger player but two different approaches '
 'are not required Poker however requires a shift in strategy and mindset as '
 'you move up Playing bigger games is not just a matter of keeping a bigger '
 'bankroll facing better players and taking things more seriously In many '
 'cases the strategies that work at low levels even strategies that are ideal '
 'at these levels stop working completely as you move up Many players find '
 'this fact extremely jarring and quite frankly they never adjust Because '
 'randomness plays such a large role in the shortterm results in poker many '
 'players never figure out why they cant progress beyond a certain level The '
 'answer is hidden amongst hundreds of all in bad beats coolers and pots '
 'folded uneventfully on the turn If youve tried to move up in the past and '
 'failed Im here to help I present seven simple steps to move up in stakes If '
 'you follow this seven step approach you will climb with your eyes open I '
 'cant guarantee that youll succeed The going gets tougher at every step and '
 'theres always a lot of work to do to get from here to there However I can '
 'promise that you wont be blindsided If you struggle you should be able to '
 'determine the reason by going through the steps in this chapter Working '
 'through the problems systematically will help you to succeed So here are my '
 'seven steps to moving up in stakes and staying there',
 'Step  Identify your source of profit at your current level Step  Identify '
 'the major strategic errors recreational players make at the higher level '
 'Step  Determine the strategic adjustments the professional players have made '
 'at the higher level to exploit the recreational players Step  Work through '
 'hand histories to figure out how to add the professional plays to your game '
 'Step  Determine the strategic weaknesses of the professional plays Step  '
 'Work through hand histories to figure out how to add exploitations of the '
 'professional plays to your game Step  Hang on for the ride Lets get going '
 'Step one Identify your source of profit at your current level With new '
 'students one of the first things I ask is if they think they win at their '
 'current level Most say yes Theyd just like to win more Move up Bigger and '
 'better If they say they win I ask them how How do they win What is it that '
 'they do that causes money to accumulate in their stacks The answers I get to '
 'that question are all over the place Probably the most common answer is that '
 'they fold better than their opponents This answer comes in a few related '
 'flavors They have patience They can get away when theyre beat They dont '
 'chase And so forth So I follow up When you fold you lose the pot You get '
 'nothing How do you win money by folding This question is usually a bit of a '
 'stumper Its true that folding well can help you to generate a lasting edge '
 'over your opponents But its not the folding that puts money in your stack If '
 'you think about it its obvious So what exactly is it that puts money in '
 'their stacks You can think about that while I get to the nextmostcommon '
 'answer I receive People say they make money because opponents pay off with '
 'bad hands Those guys who will call down to the river with second pair they '
 'are the ones who give my students their wins In response to that answer I '
 'ask You get your good hands paid off Thats how you make money They agree So '
 'if you flop a set for instance all you have to do is bet and raise every '
 'chance you get and stack the chips If you dont get sucked out on of course I '
 'start to lose them a little here Its not quite that easy they say You have '
 'to slow play sometimes And it doesnt always work out After some back and '
 'forth I get them to acknowledge that is not how it works in reality Maybe '
 'ten years ago it was that easy but not any more Many times you flop a set '
 'you bet the flop and everyone folds And if someone calls you theres a good '
 'chance they have outs to beat you If you pound the pot too hard youll lose '
 'most opponents And then I ask if their opponents ever flop sets Of course '
 'they do my students say And do you ever pay off their sets Sometimes they '
 'say Sure they get stuck paying off a set Whats my take on all this First I '
 'believe that most of these students are indeed modest winners at their '
 'levels When I get to the nitty gritty of how they play they tend to do '
 'enough things right to make a profit But very few of my new students '
 'actually understand why they win They cant articulate it Theyve learned '
 'enough tricks that work at their level but they dont fully comprehend the '
 'big picture',
 'If you dont understand why you win at your current level you will not '
 'succeed if you move up to the next level Its that simple Not only do you '
 'have to win at your current level you should be able to explain exactly why '
 'What do you do that causes money to accumulate in your stack And why Why do '
 'these things work to create a lasting edge in your favor Obviously I cant '
 'tell you what it is that you do to win in your games but Ill point you in '
 'the right direction by describing some common ways to gain consistent '
 'advantages in small stakes cash games and tournaments In live cash games '
 'theres one fact thats nearly universal Compared to what a '
 'mathematicallycorrect strategy would look like nearly everyone plays too '
 'many hands preflop And its not even close the great majority of live cash '
 'game players play way too many hands From this fact you can follow hand '
 'flows through logically to find the available money When players add extra '
 'hands preflop these are necessarily weak hands since everyone is already '
 'playing all the strong ones Weak preflop hands are weak because they too '
 'often turn into weak postflop hands So players playing too many hands '
 'preflop will have too many weak hands postflop Players can do one of two '
 'things with these extra weak hands They can fold them or they can call or '
 'raise with them Ten years ago calling with them all the way to the end was '
 'fairly common Youd see people call down flop turn and river bets with bottom '
 'pair middle pair and the like Theyd be surprised to see they were behind two '
 'pair This is not so true today Most people who play nolimit holdem even '
 'occasionally understand that they cant just call off their stacks every time '
 'they flop a pair Therefore after the flop players are frequently folding '
 'these extra weak hands This means that you can create lasting repeatable '
 'edges by bluffing in situations where opponents are likely to be saddled '
 'with too many weak hands In some games like certain Las Vegas  games you can '
 'go hog wild with this idea Ive played in many games where it was likely '
 'profitable to bluff literally every time the action checks to you on the '
 'turn and river Again the reason this makes money can be traced back to very '
 'poor preflop hand selection along with an inability to respond to postflop '
 'aggression Heres an example of this type of situation Youre playing  with  '
 'stacks Two players limp and you make it  to go A player on the button calls '
 'the big blind calls and one of the two limpers calls There is  in the pot '
 'and four players The flop is Q   Its checked to you You bet  and only the '
 'big blind calls The turn is the Q    The big blind checks you bet  into the  '
 'pot and he folds I didnt tell you what hand you held here because in some '
 'respects it doesnt matter In general it would be good to hold a hand that '
 'has some equity if called perhaps   A J   and the like This works because '
 'players are calling the  with far too many hands On a flop like  with a '
 'flush draw its easy to find yourself with a hand you dont want to fold '
 'immediately Almost any connected hand makes something on this flop KQ is top '
 'pair  is middle pair  is a gutshot But when a brick hits the turn and the '
 'betting gets heavy most players will bail on the majority of these hands On '
 'a normal board like this one nearly all the added weak hands preflop turn '
 'into marginal and weak hands after the flop These hands become deadweight '
 'that must at some point get jettisoned Meanwhile theyve cost someone a bet '
 'or two In other games you may find players calling or raising too frequently '
 'with these weak hands This is more common for instance in the small stakes '
 'games in Los Angeles You can also find this behavior in the very smallest '
 'online games Players will indeed still call down with weak pairs They will '
 'also bluff',
 'the very smallest online games Players will indeed still call down with weak '
 'pairs They will also bluff wildly raising flops and betting turns with '
 'offsuit cards that bear no resemblance to the flop',
 'For instance in Los Angeles you may encounter the following situation Its a  '
 'game with a  max buyin Two players limp and you make it  The button calls '
 'the big blind calls and both limpers call Theres  in the pot and five '
 'players The flop is Q   Everyone checks and you bet  The button and blind '
 'fold but the next player shoves for  more You call with AQ and your opponent '
 'shows J  People are quick to label the J  shove as a donkey play and its not '
 'good but its a direct symptom of the original problem which is playing too '
 'many hands preflop This player is trying to find something to do with these '
 'extra junk hands besides just folding them That is in some ways commendable '
 'But in the end if you play appropriately tight preflop and recognize that '
 'your opponents are prone to making these desperate plays you will make money '
 'Tournaments work a little differently since the stacks get shallow quickly '
 'particularly if youre playing small stakes tournaments But again if you are '
 'winning consistently at tournaments you are doing something that creates a '
 'consistent edge for yourself It behooves you to identify that edge in as '
 'much detail as you can A common error in low level tournaments is similar to '
 'the cash game error Players are often too loose for small percentages of '
 'their stack but too tight when playing allin pots This can lead opponents to '
 'fold too frequently to preflop shoves and to be too timid themselves about '
 'shoving preflop It can lead players to call off a quarter to half their '
 'stack or more and then fold to the final bet in the name of surviving in the '
 'tournament For instance say its  with a  ante Youre in the big blind Your '
 'opponent on the button has  and you have him covered He opens for  and you '
 'shove If the button isnt very careful both about constructing the set of '
 'hands he will open with on the button along with the range he is willing to '
 'call the shove with he will lose money to you A typical error would be to '
 'open many hands for  since the antes are attractive and its just a '
 'percentage of his stack but when faced with the shove call with only premium '
 'and semipremium hands If these two frequencies are out of whack the opening '
 'frequency and the shovecalling frequency then it becomes profitable to shove '
 'from the big blind with any two cards If you want to move up the first step '
 'is to look at what youre doing at your current level Are you winning And if '
 'so why Identify as specifically as you can what you do that wins you money '
 'No its not because you fold a lot No its not because any donkey will pay you '
 'off with bottom pair whenever you want Theres more to it than that Challenge '
 'yourself Write out hand examples just as I have done that exemplify your '
 'sources of profit When hands go down like this I do this and that creates an '
 'advantage for me Again be as specific as possible Force yourself to clarify '
 'your thinking Write down as many substantially different examples as you can '
 'think of Try to write down every last trick you know Once you are done with '
 'this exercise you should be able to explain precisely what it is you do that '
 'makes you money If your list of examples is short consider it perhaps '
 'evidence that you arent quite ready to move up Work on your game at your '
 'current level Analyze your opponents Figure out new ways to exploit them and '
 'try them out If they seem to work write them down Not only will this '
 'exercise prepare you to move to the next level but it will improve your '
 'performance at your current level as well This is precisely the sort of work '
 'that separates those who reach their poker goals from those who flounder',
 'Step two Identify the major strategic errors recreational players make at '
 'the higher level Once youre at this point you have to begin to sit in games '
 'at the higher level If youre playing tournaments I recommend playing events '
 'without rebuys and trying to sell some of your action to keep the extra '
 'financial risk of moving up to a minimum If youre playing cash games I '
 'recommend buying in for the same amount you bought in for at the lower level '
 'eg if you buy in for  at  then move up to  but keep buying in for  You can '
 'also sell off pieces of your cash game action to friends if you like Moving '
 'up is hard Players play better Not only that they play differently The '
 'tricks that worked at the lower level might start to work against you at the '
 'higher level I strongly recommend that you dont throw financial anxiety into '
 'the mix if you can avoid it Your transition to the higher stakes will be '
 'much smoother if by selling action and buying in shorter in cash games your '
 'level of financial risk stays roughly the same as before Okay so you begin '
 'to sit at the stakes you want to move to Your first task is to identify the '
 'recreational players at the level and profile them You want to focus first '
 'on the recreational players for four reasons They will ultimately be your '
 'main source of profit You will play most of your pots with them if only for '
 'the fact that they will tend to play looser preflop than pros do Their '
 'strategies are usually simpler and easier to reverse engineer than those of '
 'pros Theres a good chance that the recreational players at your new level '
 'play in a fundamentally different way than the ones you left behind The '
 'final reason is critically important and ignoring it is the undoing of many '
 'attempts to move up All serious players know that recreational players keep '
 'the poker economy swirling Without them there would be relatively little '
 'profit to go around But many players particularly those who lack experience '
 'at the higher stakes dont take recreational players seriously enough They '
 'are fish who do stupid things and give you money Not so fast If you move up '
 'to  or  cash or to four figure buyin tournaments and assume that the '
 'recreational players are braindead fools you will get destroyed Here are a '
 'few general observations about recreational players at these levels They '
 'tend to be wealthy If you play poker recreationally at these fairly '
 'significant stakes you likely have money Of course some are just being '
 'desperately risky with their meager stakes but many are well todo Wealthy '
 'people tend to not be stupid Again there are clear exceptions But most of '
 'the recreational players at higher levels who are successful in professions '
 'or business are pretty smart They are competitive Again this is a trait '
 'shared by many successful people They want to win They dont want to sit '
 'there and be a punching bag for some pro poker player wannabe If they start '
 'to feel like things arent going their way they will shake things up They are '
 'riskseeking Ive found that many recreational players at small stakes low '
 'buyin',
 'tournaments and cash games up to  are fairly timid I dont mean that they are '
 'life timid but good poker requires the willingness to sometimes shove chips '
 'around the table with reckless abandon At the lower stakes many recreational '
 'players are worried about the money and ultimately they dont have it in them '
 'to take the risks Not so with higher stakes recreational players Again these '
 'tend to be wealthy people who often had to be risktakers in life to acquire '
 'their wealth Most of these guys arent sweating the money and they frequently '
 'have a naturally aggressive and risktaking disposition I wont belabor the '
 'point Recreational players while not playing the most fundamentally sound '
 'brand of nolimit can be tricky opponents Your first step when you move up '
 'should be to get a handle on these players and to learn their weaknesses As '
 'always recreational players will tend to play too many hands preflop Because '
 'of this they will necessarily be vulnerable in one of two ways they will '
 'fold too much in certain situations and they will call andor raise too much '
 'in other situations Typically especially at higher levels where recreational '
 'players tend to have some nuance to their games they will make both errors '
 'Sometimes they will fold too much and you should increase your bluffing '
 'Other times they will get desperate and call down or bluff raise too much '
 'Your job is to observe their games and determine which error they are likely '
 'to make at any given point Here are some common ones you might look for Many '
 'recreational players will fold the turn too easily in  pots Say youre '
 'playing  with  stacks A recreational player opens for  and you  to  from the '
 'big blind He calls The flop comes J   You bet  and he calls There is  behind '
 'and  in the pot The turn is the J    You bet  This bet the  into  will be '
 'one that many recreational players fold to far too often It all begins with '
 'the preflop play Not only is this player opening to  with too many hands but '
 'many recreational players also call a  nearly  of the time So its entirely '
 'possible that this player has a hand range including  percent of all hands '
 'at this point When the flop comes  rainbow its similar to one of the '
 'previous examples Its fairly easy to have something on that flop But its '
 'hard to have something really strong It shouldnt be too surprising to see '
 'the recreational player call the flop He will after all not want to fold a '
 'hand like  on the flop just because you bet But when the bottom card pairs '
 'and you bet again many players will be concerned that you have an overpair '
 'and fold Again this logic doesnt apply universally Its merely a common error '
 'that I see at the  level You will have to find these scenarios on your own '
 'tailored to the games you play But what youre looking for doesnt change much '
 'Youre looking for situations where recreational players will be forced to '
 'fold too often or situations where they flail around too much with '
 'speculative calls and bluffs Any time you see a bluff made with a hand that '
 'has little to no equity when called eg offsuit junk or you see a calldown '
 'made with bottom pair or worse youve potentially found a scenario where the '
 'player gives too much action Try to figure out what it was about the '
 'situation that encouraged him to give the action Theres usually a reason '
 'Maybe a top card paired and the player thought this was a good bluff card '
 'Maybe he called you because he thought youd bluff the top card pairing The '
 'thing not to do is to shrug your shoulders and say Donkeys call down with '
 'anything Recreational players absolutely do not call down with everything '
 'even at the lowest levels They are unlikely to do it at a level higher than '
 'what youre used to They call down for a reason Its often not that',
 'unlikely to do it at a level higher than what youre used to They call down '
 'for a reason Its often not that complex a reason so try to figure it out '
 'Youre looking for patterns of behavior that you can use in the future',
 'More often than finding recreational players bluffing or calling down wildly '
 'however you will see them fold Their folding frequencies in many situations '
 'are high enough that you can profitably bluff with any two cards The  pot '
 'example above is one such situation but these scenarios abound Try to '
 'identify as many as possible Generally speaking the more average mundane or '
 'unremarkable the board and action the more likely youll find recreational '
 'players folding too much In these pots its hard to go wrong if you bet the '
 'turn In higher stakes tournaments the errors that recreational players make '
 'run the gamut When stacks are deep they make many of the same errors that '
 'cash game players make At a WSOP Main Event one year I ran into a player who '
 'liked to bet roughly twice pot on each street but only if he was bluffing '
 'Believe it or not it actually worked for him a number of times throughout '
 'the day since the other players either hadnt caught on or didnt have the '
 'confidence to call him down for their entire stacks with just one pair When '
 'stacks get shallow a common error I see recreational players make in higher '
 'stakes tournaments is actually one of overaggression They will discount the '
 'strength of an early position raise presumably because they view everyone in '
 'these tournaments as aggressive and shove with a hand thats too weak for the '
 'situation For instance in another WSOP event I saw the following action It '
 'was  ante A tournament pro made it  from under the gun Two players folded '
 'and then someone shoved for about  from four off the button The under the '
 'gun player called and the shover a recreational player showed K J The '
 'original raiser showed A K and the recreational player should expect to be '
 'called by a similarly strong hand most of the time The main idea however is '
 'to be as systematic as possible Move up to higher stakes Observe the '
 'recreational players In cash games remember that they will nearly all play '
 'too many hands Try to figure out the markers that determine whether they '
 'will make a folding error or a callingraising error Do they react to certain '
 'board textures Do they react to bet sizes Do they react to recent history eg '
 'do they want to stand up to a bully Note any patterns you identify and write '
 'them down Dont be afraid to take notes at the table Its much more important '
 'that you gather the knowledge you need to succeed at the higher level than '
 'it is to look cool and effortless In tournaments again identify all the '
 'errors that your opponents make The most important errors to notice are the '
 'ones that come up most frequently Preflop openshove situations are very '
 'important Notice if youve found any errors at the higher level that you '
 'didnt see very often at your previous level You should be able to document '
 'some differences Particularly at higher levels recreational players will '
 'tend to be more willing to be aggressive with extra junk hands Try to spot '
 'this difference in action If you cant see any differences from what youre '
 'used to youre either very lucky to have a player pool that doesnt get '
 'tougher as you move up or you are missing something Step three Determine the '
 'strategic adjustments the professional players have made at the higher level '
 'to exploit the recreational players You may have read the last step and '
 'thought I was perhaps a little crazy Youre supposed to watch all these pots '
 'that recreational players play and write down where you think they are '
 'calling or bluffing too much What a lot of work that is and what exactly are '
 'you supposed to be looking for Well yes its a lot of work Moving up is a lot '
 'of work at least if you want to succeed Moving up',
 'and sticking means that youve gotten substantially better at a game that is '
 'complex and difficult to get better at Think about it Out of the hundreds of '
 'thousands of people who play poker seriously most of them want to win money '
 'move up and win more money And how many actually succeed Few And out of '
 'those who move up and stick how many can move up again and stick again Very '
 'few This game is hard and theres no substitute for doing the work But there '
 'are some shortcuts This step describes one of them The good thing about '
 'moving up to a new level is that you arent exploring uncharted waters '
 'Instead you are entering a system that is already thoroughly established '
 'There are occasional recreational players There are recreational regulars '
 'There are semipros and also everyday professional players These players all '
 'have plenty of history at the level Theyve worked things out You can watch '
 'the pros and harness the work that theyve already done The pros are usually '
 'fairly easy to spot They tend to be young under  years old In cash games '
 'they tend to play with maximum stacks or if there is no maximum with deep '
 'stacks that cover most of the table Not every  player with a deep stack is a '
 'pro and not every pro is an  player with a deep stack but if you start '
 'looking at these players youll find what you want fairly quickly Watch the '
 'pros play pots with the recreational players A lot of moving up successfully '
 'is just sitting back and watching Are there any moves that the pros seem to '
 'make repeatedly Winning poker involves finding a few weaknesses and hitting '
 'them again and again Observe how pots develop between the recreational '
 'players and the pros Look for things that seem to keep happening Maybe the '
 'pros  the recreational players a lot Maybe the pros raise the turn against '
 'the recreational players a lot Maybe they call turn raises a lot Whatever it '
 'is just watch these pots and look for patterns If you see something '
 'happening a lot theres a good chance that the pros are doing it '
 'intentionally to exploit a weakness theyve found in the recreational players '
 'play It amazes me how few players do this So many people play poker inside '
 'their own little bubbles They examine the dynamics they have with other '
 'players sometimes in minute detail They try to reverse engineer the image '
 'they have with other players They level themselves in and out of making '
 'plays based on history and game flow But these details they track all relate '
 'directly to themselves Im just as interested if not more so in the dynamics '
 'other players have established with each other This is particularly relevant '
 'if Im new to a game Any time I am a relative unknown whether I am moving '
 'casinos changing stakes or playing a different game than I usually play I '
 'worry very little about my image Instead I want to see the relationships '
 'other players have created with each other If one of the apparent pros at '
 'the table keeps picking on one or two players raising and  them preflop to '
 'isolate I want to know why I want to figure out what their angle is If you '
 'pay attention and try to work it backwards usually its a simple task to '
 'figure out whats going on Then once you figure out what the pro is doing you '
 'analyze it yourself Dont just emulate other players blindly But consider it '
 'If a pro is  a lot of pots watch how most of them conclude Does the pro win '
 'a lot of them without showdown How is he winning the pots What is it about '
 'the way his opponents are responding to the  that allows him to win so many '
 'pots Is the pro just getting lucky running into a series of missed draws and '
 'weak pairs Or is he picking on something that is a persistent flaw in the '
 'strategy of the recreational players One of the complaints many players have '
 'about live poker is how slow it is In between hands so many',
 'flaw in the strategy of the recreational players One of the complaints many '
 'players have about live poker is how slow it is In between hands so many '
 'people read their phones play games on tablets talk to friends and so on I '
 'do it too If you play a lot of hours you will inevitably feel the need here '
 'and there to take your mind off the game Many authors scold these habits '
 'there is so much information out there they say if you just pay attention '
 'Ill take the middle ground If you are established at a level and have a '
 'strong track record then you can zone out from time to time If you are '
 'scrapping to move up however you should put more effort into watching the '
 'game Even then you may have to zone out sometimes to keep your sanity Do it '
 'when two',
 'recreational players are in a pot Or in a multiway limped pot The most '
 'important pots to watch are the ones that pros play against recreational '
 'players These are the pots that you can really learn something from if you '
 'just watch After all what the pro is doing in this pot you may want to do in '
 'the next one Really its this simple If you want to move up a level and stick '
 'watch those who have already done it Step four Work through hand histories '
 'to figure out how to add the professional plays to your game Ok so you are '
 'trying to move up Youve been sitting in  games for a couple of weeks now Or '
 'you have played a few bigger tournaments In the cash games youve been buying '
 'in short and selling a little action In the tournaments youve been selling '
 'enough action to keep the risk down to your normal level You have considered '
 'carefully what made you successful at your previous level Youve been '
 'watching the recreational players at your new level to determine to what '
 'extent your old tricks will or wont continue to work Youve identified the '
 'pros at your new level and you pay close attention to how they interact with '
 'the recreational players Youve been looking for patterns that recur in hands '
 'they play looking for situations the pros may be trying to exploit Now its '
 'time to do some work You need to go through your play and figure out what '
 'changes to make to take advantage of your observations Every time you play a '
 'session at your new level write down as many of your hands as you can Ive '
 'made instructional videos for Red Chip Poker where I wrote down every single '
 'hand I played for six and a half hours So I know its possible to record '
 'everything If people make wisecrack comments about your note taking brush it '
 'off Ive had sessions where people ignored it completely and Ive had sessions '
 'where it was a running topic of conversation for hours Once you finish a '
 'session and have a few dozen hands do the following Write down what mistakes '
 'the recreational players were making that you could take advantage of In '
 'this particular session at this particular table that you just played where '
 'was the money coming from Identify it as specifically as you can Seat  was '
 'playing too many hands and running wild flop and turn bluffs Seat  was '
 'calling everything to the turn and then folding most hands The more detail '
 'the better Again it is critically important that you can observe a table and '
 'be able to articulate where the money is coming from If you cant theres an '
 'old saying about being able to spot the sucker Write down any moves you '
 'noticed the pros making frequently during the session One guy kept  betting '
 'Another guy raised the turn three times You saw someone check back the flop '
 'and raise the turn twice Whatever it is note it Try to figure out if it was '
 'just the coincidence of similar cards or if the play represents part of the '
 'pros strategies against the recreational players Go through your hands one '
 'by one You are looking for situations to exploit that you may have missed at '
 'the table Think about where the money comes from Did you make plays that '
 'were always trying to get some of that money Or did you make some plays that '
 'seemed to ignore the source of profit at the table Could you have played '
 'hands differently to create an exploitable situation And think about the '
 'plays the pros make Were there any opportunities during your session to '
 'emulate the pros Did you fold any turns that you suspect one of the pros may '
 'have raised Once you have identified candidate hands to play differently '
 'analyze them Put numbers on the different',
 'options You folded the turn but maybe you should have raised instead How '
 'often do you think your opponent would have folded to the raise Write out '
 'what you think your opponents hand range might have looked like at that '
 'point in the hand and consider which hands he might fold to a raise Go '
 'through this process after every session Sure its a lot of work But youre '
 'trying to move up and if you arent willing to work I dont like your '
 'prospects Think of this work like going to the gym After any single session '
 'you may not notice that youre much better at poker But if you do this for '
 'every session you play over the next month by the end of the month you will '
 'be better The goal is to find the patterns and build intuition Say you '
 'notice that the pros tend to raise when flush cards hit the turn You do the '
 'math on some hands you played and you realize that under some reasonable '
 'assumptions you could have raised a flush turn with any two cards and shown '
 'an automatic profit You will remember this the next time you play Once that '
 'flush card hits the board you will immediately consider a raise you may '
 'never have considered before Pattern recognition and intuition is what will '
 'make or break your attempt to move to a higher level The more clearly you '
 'perceive whats happening in your games and the more you work to identify '
 'these situations in your own sessions the more able you will be to seize '
 'opportunities as they arise There is no question that you are missing '
 'profitable opportunities The more you work to unearth the ones you are '
 'missing the better your chances are of reaching your goals Step five '
 'Determine the strategic weaknesses of the professional plays Three major '
 'pitfalls tend to doom players who are trying to move to higher stakes The '
 'first one that recreational players at the higher level often will not be '
 'beaten with your old tricks Ive covered already This is the biggest '
 'potential problem because if you dont adjust to beat the recreational '
 'players you have no shot The second pitfall is also potentially a problem '
 'The professional players at the higher level might badly exploit you If you '
 'want to move up you dont have to become the very best player at the level '
 'But you do have to learn how to hang with the established pros well enough '
 'that you can beat the recreational players and turn a profit If youve '
 'followed the steps so far youve laid a solid foundation to accomplish that '
 'The next step is to figure out how to hold your own with the pros Its likely '
 'at first that the pros will react to you as if you are a recreational player '
 'You will either be unknown to them or they will know you as a player who '
 'typically plays smaller If they treat you like a recreational player they '
 'will try to use many of the same tricks against you that they use against '
 'the other recreational players This is a second reason why it is critically '
 'important that you observe closely how the pros interact with the '
 'recreational players Not only can you begin to use some of their tricks but '
 'you can also learn what you need to defend against For instance say you '
 'notice that a pro in your game likes to raise flops containing all low cards '
 'with position and bet the turn Heres an example',
 'A recreational player opens from two off the button for  in a  game with  '
 'stacks The pro calls on the button The big blind calls Theres  in the pot '
 'The flop comes    The big blind checks and the recreational player bets  The '
 'pro makes it  to go The big blind folds and the recreational player calls '
 'The turn is the    J The recreational player checks and the pro bets  The '
 'recreational player folds Youve seen him use this betting line several times '
 'against a few different players on similar flops You may have thought What '
 'sort of hands is he raising a ragged flop like this with He cant have a set '
 'every time can he You broke the play down and you realized that unless the '
 'recreational player resolved to defend against the aggression with more than '
 'just QQ or better the flop raise and turn bet would win the pot very often '
 'You suspect that this is a play that the pro uses regularly on certain flop '
 'textures against vulnerable opponents Youve analyzed some of the hands youve '
 'played and identified situations where you could have run the play '
 'profitably The next step is to figure out how you will handle the situation '
 'from the perspective of the recreational player To make this play work the '
 'pro is using two main factors First its hard to make a strong hand when the '
 'flop comes with three low cards This is true whether you were the preflop '
 'raiser or not but perhaps preflop raisers are especially vulnerable Second '
 'most players are unwilling to risk stacks on hands where they missed the '
 'flop Since these flops miss so many hands and since people dont want to '
 'invest in hands where they miss the pro can sweep up not just the preflop '
 'pot but also win the flop continuation bet as well So what should you do '
 'Since its obvious the pro is attacking continuation bets in situations like '
 'these stop continuation betting so often Your pro opponent on the button is '
 'going to see your bet as an opportunity and not a threat so you shouldnt bet '
 'with hands vulnerable to pressure such as AQ  and the like When you do '
 'continuation bet make sure that most of the time but not necessarily always '
 'you have a hand that youre willing to confront the pressure with Overpairs '
 'and sets are great for this though these hands are rare You might also try '
 'it with hands like flush and straight draws Say you bet the flop get raised '
 'and call Then you check the turn and checkraise a nearly potsized bet This '
 'is an extremely strong line and your professional opponent will have to give '
 'you credit for a range saturated with hands like top two pair and sets If '
 'you also run that line with some flush and straight draws you will have '
 'neutralized most of the threat You may also wish to checkcall twice and '
 'maybe even three times with unimproved AK and AQ Whether this is profitable '
 'depends on the range of hands the pro is using to apply pressure But if the '
 'pro is used to getting folds from recreational players he may be getting far '
 'out of line with his bluffing ranges in which case calling down with these '
 'hands will protect you Naturally you will have to do the work on your own to '
 'decide what threat you face from the pros at your new level But whenever you '
 'think you have put your finger on one of their tricks you should analyze it '
 'both so you can adopt it in your game as well as to protect yourself from '
 'being similarly exploited Another thing you should do especially when you '
 'are new to the level is to reverse tells on the pros Some bets for instance '
 'act as potent triggers of aggression for a pro Consider this hand A pro '
 'opens for  from three off the button A player calls on the button and both '
 'blinds call Theres  in the pot The flop comes Q J  The blinds check and the '
 'pro bets  The button folds and both blinds call Theres  in the pot The turn '
 'is the Q J   The small blind bets  The big blind folds',
 'J  The blinds check and the pro bets  The button folds and both blinds call '
 'Theres  in the pot The turn is the Q J   The small blind bets  The big blind '
 'folds This bet will trigger most pros at the  level to raise This '
 'miniaturesized bet out of turn in a multiway pot is a play most recreational '
 'players wouldnt make with a strong hand like a set top two or even a strong '
 'top pair With these hands theyd either check to try to land a checkraise or '
 'theyd bet a',
 'bigger amount to protect themselves against giving a free card to draws Once '
 'the pro can eliminate nearly all strong hands from an opponents range he '
 'will attack It really almost never fails Whenever I see someone bet this way '
 'into a pro I think to myself Hes gonna raise And then bam theres the raise '
 'So you make the play when you want action You can do it with a set Or you '
 'can do it with a draw where your play is to slam the door with an allin '
 'reraise after the pro raises your minibet Tell reversals are a bit of a '
 'gimmick Youll catch the pros with their pants down once or twice on these '
 'and then theyll start responding less predictably But when youre new to a '
 'level when you are still the unknown quantity you can use them to your '
 'advantage Grab those cheap plays when you can as it will help to you to gain '
 'a foothold at the level with some early wins Step six Work through hand '
 'histories to figure out how to add exploitations of the professional plays '
 'to your game This step is much like step  except instead of focusing on how '
 'to exploit the recreational players at the level you focus on how to hold '
 'your own against and exploit the pros Go through the hands youve recorded '
 'from your sessions and look at the ones youve played against the pros '
 'Analyze each hand with as much attention to detail as you can For each step '
 'in the action write down hand ranges both for you and your opponent For your '
 'opponent obviously you will have to make educated guesses While your guesses '
 'dont have to be perfect they should at least be internally consistent For '
 'example your opponent cant both choose to bet the turn  of the time and have '
 'the nuts every time The more often your opponent bets the weaker his betting '
 'range has to be Failing to understand this fact is an extremely common error '
 'that players make when they are trying to move up Its easy to give '
 'aggressive pros too much credit for strong hand ranges when they make big '
 'bets and raises Your opponents are either aggressive or very strong but not '
 'both at the same time This tradeoff becomes particularly prominent if your '
 'opponents are also playing many hands preflop Aggressive players who play '
 'many hands preflop do not have strong ranges Period When you analyze hands '
 'pay particular attention to your folds If you fold to a pros bet or raise be '
 'sure that it was an accurate fold Look at the range you think your '
 'professional opponent was likely to have at that point Was it particularly '
 'strong or was it likely the pro was just betting to take advantage of '
 'weakness And then look at your range Was the hand you folded one of the '
 'worst hands you were likely to have at that point If so your fold was '
 'probably fine If not if you folded a hand that was in the middle of the pack '
 'then there may be a problem Look at ways to change the way you play hands '
 'like these in the future to avoid making the fold Perhaps you should check '
 'the flop instead of bet Perhaps you need to defend your range with some '
 'bluffraises Perhaps you should have just bit the bullet and called with your '
 'marginal hand In my book Pokers  The One Big Secret That Keeps Elite Players '
 'On Top I offer you a detailed look at how to analyze hands like these You '
 'can make sure your professional opponents dont find leaks to exploit and you '
 'can also find some of the mistakes these pros might be making If you are '
 'serious about learning how to get inside the heads of the professional '
 'players at higher stakes you should consider',
 'giving that book a read Step seven Hang on for the ride And now comes the '
 'hardest part You have to weather the ups and downs Heres the reality of '
 'moving up The swings get much harder to take This is true whether you play '
 'cash games or tournaments And its not just the obvious that if you are '
 'risking twice the money your swings will double Its a lot worse than that '
 'The swings explode once you start to crack the games that professionals '
 'inhabit There are two reasons First your edge goes down When you are picking '
 'on the very weak players at the bottom of the stakes totem pole you can '
 'create enormous edges for yourself Sure they will suck out on you with their '
 'two outers And they will get dealt aces sometimes when you get kings But its '
 'not uncommon when you play at the lower stakes for one of your opponents to '
 'all but hand you a stack They will drastically misread a relatively common '
 'situation and pay off your set with bottom pair Or they will try to fire an '
 'utterly hopeless bluff at you These gifts and other plays that give you an '
 'oversized edge help to cushion you from the natural inevitable downswings of '
 'the game When you move up you will get these gifts much less often The '
 'recreational players while still fully exploitable are savvier If you want '
 'their money you will have to work for it And the pros are trying to give '
 'nothing away This means that you will be exposed to the full brunt of a bad '
 'run Beyond that games get more aggressive as you move up and this also '
 'increases the variance The recreational players will be more likely to test '
 'you with turn bluffraises than to fold meekly and predictably to your bets '
 'While this means youll win more monster pots youll also lose a whole lot '
 'more of them as well The pros at higher levels also will be more likely to '
 'put you to stacksized decisions This means that the upswings will be harder '
 'to come by and the downswings will be steeper deeper and take much longer to '
 'dig out of This harsh reality may be hard to take when you see it for the '
 'first time Here are a few tips to deal with the volatility  Buy in smaller '
 'in cash games and sell shares in both cash games and tournaments and avoid '
 'rebuy tournaments I mentioned this one above but it bears repeating here '
 'When you move up do what you can in advance to cushion the financial burden '
 'of playing at the higher level If you dont heed this advice and if you have '
 'any personal financial constraints at all you will eventually hit a '
 'downswing that causes you to doubt your ability and your bankroll  Do not '
 'try to adjust your game to remove volatility This is something people try to '
 'do in conjunction with Tip  Dont Its a trap and if you go down this road you '
 'will only doom yourself to failure What do I mean by this Many people think '
 'they can reduce volatility by taking less aggressive actions at the table '
 'Instead of calling in a marginal situation you fold and wait for a better '
 'spot Instead of launching the bold bluff you pass Instead of going for thin '
 'value you check it down to win the pot',
 'Heres the naked truth of these adjustments They mean playing weaker softer '
 'poker You cant afford to be either weak or soft when you move up Any play '
 'you make with the express intention of making your swings smaller just gives '
 'pros an easy way to take your money I cannot condemn these adjustments '
 'strongly enough If you want to reduce your volatility you play smaller or '
 'sell action But once youre at the table you play as hard as you know how  '
 'Break downswings early by moving temporarily back down Until you are '
 'completely comfortable at your new level you should move back down to your '
 'old level as soon as you hit a downswing of any significance Drop down '
 'before the pain hits you Drop down when its still a calculated decision and '
 'not an emotional one If you read too many interviews of star poker players '
 'you will hear the same story again and again Gee I deposited  and the next '
 'night I scored  in a tournament Then I jumped up immediately to  cash games '
 'and ran it up to a cool million by the end of the next week I have two '
 'thoughts about these stories selection bias and selective memory Theres '
 'massive selection bias While these stories may be generally true they are '
 'the stories of the ones who have run ridiculously well through their '
 'risktaking The vast majority of people who deposit  end up broke The same '
 'thing goes for those who win  in a tournament and take it straight to  Broke '
 'Thats reality And its true for players of all different skill levels And I '
 'also think its selective memory Nearly everyone experiences major setbacks '
 'in poker Very few people just plow their way up in stakes never looking back '
 'You should expect moving up to be an up and down and up and down and up '
 'affair for quite a while This is not to say that its impossible to move up '
 'Certainly not But unless you get unbelievably ridiculously lucky moving up '
 'successfully will require a lot of work and a lot of willingness to bounce '
 'back and forth between stakes before you finally establish yourself at the '
 'new level So if you hit any kind of downswing at the new level just drop '
 'back down for a while until you feel ready to give it another go  Analyze '
 'your play like crazy Nearly this entire chapter has been devoted to the type '
 'of analysis you should do to improve your chances to succeed at moving up '
 'Thats because its by far the single most important thing you can do There '
 'arent shortcuts here The more you work the more you will get results '
 'Analyzing your play does something else also It helps you understand why you '
 'are succeeding or failing Not only will this help you improve it will also '
 'improve your mental state So many people try to move up without doing the '
 'work They get beaten back down And the question lingers with them Did I run '
 'bad or am I not good enough Do I have a chance if I try again These '
 'questions can be crippling if you let them get to you If you are constantly '
 'analyzing your play however you will have the tools to answer these '
 'questions for yourself You will have a sense for whether you played badly '
 'ran badly or both You will know that you can correct your errors and try '
 'again Final thoughts Whether you play cash games or tournaments moving up '
 'means a lot more than just upping the stakes The recreational players play '
 'with less fear and more unpredictability They are smarter and can test you '
 'The',
 'professional players are also better But if you are willing to be cautious '
 'smart and studious you can move up and eventually dominate the new level The '
 'first step is to make sure you understand how youre currently winning What '
 'do you do today that puts the money in your stack The more specific you can '
 'be the better Next you want to play a little at the higher level Analyze the '
 'recreational players and determine which of your current tricks will still '
 'succeed and which ones youll have to rework This can be hard to do '
 'accurately because often were overly optimistic when were first trying to '
 'move up We may see the things we want to see but miss the ones that will '
 'cause problems Try to be as systematic as you can Watching the established '
 'professionals in the game can go a long way to help you do this Anyone who '
 'is already winning at the level youre trying to crack is someone you can '
 'learn something from So pay attention when they are in hands with '
 'recreational players Look to see how they create their edges Are they doing '
 'things that you dont do If so try to reverse engineer their plays Do the '
 'math Should it work Is it something you want to incorporate into your game '
 'Once youve done this for a while you should take a look at your play Find '
 'the places where you could be making plays that youre missing When you break '
 'down your own play like this it will help you remember to try something new '
 'the next time the situation arises If you are struggling with trying to '
 'understand what the pros are doing you can even try something shocking You '
 'can ask them Offer to buy them a beer and talk about some hands Many '
 'professional players are more than happy to talk poker even with someone up '
 'and coming in their regular game It definitely can never hurt to ask And I '
 'for one have learned more about poker from other people than I have sitting '
 'in a room by myself in front of a computer Once you have an idea about how '
 'the pros are playing its time to turn the tables Try to figure out what the '
 'weaknesses of these plays are Your goal here is twofold You are trying to '
 'protect yourself from being exploited the same way the recreational players '
 'are and you are trying to make some money off the pros until they figure out '
 'what youre doing and adjust At this stage you want to pay special attention '
 'to all hands you play with the pros at your new level Analyze them as '
 'thoroughly as you can Use the method I introduce in Pokers  to check whether '
 'you are playing a strong or exploitable strategy in these hands Your '
 'ultimate goal when you move up should be to become the best player at the '
 'level This means that you can thoroughly exploit the recreational players '
 'while at the same time creating an edge against all the other pros as well '
 'You accomplish this through long consideration of strategies and '
 'counterstrategies and with thorough hand analyses Finally moving up is '
 'usually a very bumpy ride When nolimit holdem is played at a higher level '
 'the variance shoots up Also the easy money dries up These two factors cause '
 'downswings to be much bigger and badder than what you may be used to I '
 'strongly recommend not trying to force it Dont expose yourself to big '
 'unrecoverable losses at the new level Instead be happy to bounce back and '
 'forth between the higher level and your usual one Play in the bigger games '
 'when they are good and play at your usual level when the bigger games are '
 'just average Play the bigger buyin tournaments when theyve been heavily '
 'marketed and are juicy and stick to your normal level otherwise If you '
 'commit to do the work prepare yourself for the much bigger swings and keep '
 'your head in the game you give yourself the best possible chance to conquer '

 ' MY STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS Introduction When I first started playing poker I '
 'didnt know much about the game However I quickly realized that to be '
 'successful I needed to study the game and to be as diligent about poker as I '
 'am about other aspects of my life Those of us who started playing at the '
 'start of the poker boom had the time to study the game and to develop '
 'strategies that helped us thrive at the tables simply because the players '
 'that populated most of the seats in the online poker rooms were totally '
 'clueless It is much harder to start from scratch in todays poker environment '
 'Most players today have a decent understanding of the game and use at least '
 'a somewhat solid strategy People will give you their chips During the Main '
 'Event of the World Series of PokerEurope I was asked how I manage to make so '
 'many deep runs in tournaments My answer was I make a point to wait around '
 'for someone to give me their chips One hand from that tournament perfectly '
 'illustrates this concept In general my strategy is to play reasonably tight '
 'and aggressive Unfortunately on this occasion I was totally card dead '
 'resulting in me playing very few pots On one hand I raised with  and folded '
 'to a huge reraise from an overly aggressive player I folded every hand for '
 'the next three orbits Eventually I woke up with A A and raised The same '
 'player as before reraised me again Throughout the day I had observed this '
 'guy making gigantic raises and reraises whenever he had the opportunity True '
 'to form his reraise was much larger than you normally see I chose to simply '
 'call forcing him to stay in the pot with all of his junk The flop came Q   '
 'My opponent overbet the pot and I called again keeping him in the pot with '
 'his entire range The turn was the Q    He quickly pushed allin for about  '
 'times the pot and I made an easy call He reluctantly tabled   I won a big '
 'pot and became the chip leader in the tournament despite playing almost no '
 'hands When you are card dead at an overly aggressive table there is nothing '
 'wrong with sitting back and waiting for a maniac to make an error Avoid '
 'mistakes I actively make a point to avoid set up situations If you rarely '
 'risk your entire stack with a marginal',
 'holding it is tough to go broke When I have a strong but not amazing hand I '
 'dont bloat the pot Instead I keep the pot small until it becomes clear I '
 'have the best hand In order to make deep runs you have to be able to give up '
 'in marginal situations when it becomes clear your opponent has either a '
 'strong or premium holding It is important to realize that you cannot win the '
 'tournament in the early stages but you can certainly lose it Developing the '
 'ability to fold in the crucial situations is a critical component of my '
 'success Even when I may be ahead Ill muck my hand if Im likely to have '
 'difficulty making the correct decisions on future betting rounds I recently '
 'played a hand in a tournament that illustrates this concept beautifully '
 'With  blinds someone limped from first position and a  amateur who had been '
 'playing fairly tight raised to  from the lojack seat three to the right of '
 'the button The cutoff called I woke up with QQ in the small blind with a  '
 'chip stack I decided to call hoping to see a good flop before committing a '
 'significant amount of chips to the pot The raiser likely has either a '
 'premium hand which beats me namely AA and KK or perhaps a decently strong '
 'unpaired hand such as AJ or a middle pair such as  Notice that by calling '
 'with QQ I avoid the most obvious difficult decision of being reraised '
 'Whenever you have a strong hand that cannot reasonably withstand significant '
 'pressure you should usually call instead of raise Notice that if I reraise '
 'and the initial raiser calls I do not gain any information that I do not '
 'already have If he  I will either have to fold my powerful QQ or commit even '
 'more chips from out of position against what is often a better hand By '
 'calling I both minimize the price of my future mistakes and avoid '
 'detrimental ones The limper also decided to call  more The pot was  The flop '
 'came    While this may appear to be a good flop for my hand since I have an '
 'overpair it is actually one of the worst flops for me I could easily be up '
 'against AA KK    and even an unpaired preflop hand such as QJ or  Even when '
 'my opponents have draws I am only in marginal shape The player in the cutoff '
 'is the one who most likely has me in trouble The cutoffs decision to call '
 'the preflop raise instead of  puts hands such as   and  squarely in his '
 'range Most of the time in this situation I check rather than bet into my '
 'opponents Notice if I lead and get either called or raised I am usually '
 'either slightly ahead or way behind When you are either slightly ahead or '
 'way behind you do not want to put chips in the pot It is important to have a '
 'plan for the future betting rounds Thinking Ill check and see what happens '
 'is not a profitable plan Here was my plan when I decided to check on the '
 'flop If the lojack bets and the cutoff calls I have an easy fold Either '
 'opponent can easily have me crushed Even if I happen to have the best hand '
 'at the moment there are a lot of cards that can fall on the turn that are '
 'very bad for me If the lojack bets and the cutoff folds I will usually call '
 'electing to evaluate the turn action If the cutoff bets I will usually call '
 'and see what develops on the turn If the lojack happens to check raise on '
 'the flop I will make an easy fold If the lojack calls the cutoffs flop bet I '
 'will either proceed with extreme caution or fold depending on my reads '
 'Notice how before I even act I have developed a plan that I will stick to '
 'unless I pick up an abnormal tell Board texture and your opponents range One '
 'thing you may notice about my strategy is that I rarely know exactly where I '
 'stand in a hand Most',
 'amateurs strongly desire to have perfect information The price they pay for '
 'it is way too high I could easily have the best hand on the flop However '
 'that alone is not a good enough reason to proceed The board texture is '
 'simply too wet Being able to accurately assess how a flop connects with an '
 'opponents range is one of the key differences between professional and '
 'amateur players Amateur players often consider only their two cards and '
 'whether the flop helped them or not They see QQ as an overpair and they '
 'think overpairs are powerful That is the end of their thought process I have '
 'a lot of chips remaining in my stack and am in the early stages of the '
 'tournament There is a ton of valuing in conserving my stack because I will '
 'find many more profitable situations in the future In the example the lojack '
 'bet  on the flop and the cutoff called Sticking with my plan I folded The '
 'turn was the  and again the lojack bet and the cutoff called While the turn '
 'did not complete any draws if I was still in the pot I would have folded to '
 'the turn bet There was another round of betting on the river When the hands '
 'were revealed at the showdown I was happy to see I was against the lojacks  '
 'and the cutoffs AA Points to consider Instead of simply folding to the flop '
 'bet and a call most amateurs will call or even worse raise with Q Q Even '
 'though this checkraise will occasionally work truth is they are risking way '
 'too many chips along with their tournament life with a marginal hand from '
 'out of position The stacks are still extraordinarily deep There is no reason '
 'to face being eliminated or crippled so early in the tournament in a '
 'marginal situation It is important to note that the strength of your hand '
 'varies drastically depending on your stack size and the stage of the '
 'tournament Queens are a much stronger hand when you have a short stack '
 'compared to when you have a lot of chips In the example above if you had '
 'perhaps  or less you should probably be fine with getting your stack in I '
 'avoid putting myself in a position to lose my entire stack and end my '
 'tournament in marginal situations I take the time to consider my opponents '
 'ranges their playing style and the board texture in addition to the strength '
 'of my hole cards It is important to realize quickly whether or not you are '
 'likely to have the best hand without risking a ton of chips In the example '
 'above I got accurate information by simply checking Sometimes checking will '
 'give you almost the same information as betting Checking is certainly '
 'cheaper Table image In each hand your cards are only a small part of the '
 'equation You have to pay careful attention to your opponents overall '
 'strategy and likely range in each specific situation Also you have to be '
 'constantly aware of what your opponents think about you The way your '
 'opponents perceive you is referred to as your table image Hopefully you '
 'noticed when I described the hands above that I mentioned various defining '
 'characteristics of each player When deciding the right course of action I '
 'consider the players involved my read on them plus all of the details of the '
 'specific situation Remember you must consider every bit of information '
 'available to you in order to decide how to best play your hand For example '
 'the scariest player in the hand above is the cutoff He has the widest '
 'preflop calling range and the flop is more likely to hit his hand than the '
 'preflop raiser Lets change the action in the hand above Lets assume everyone '
 'checks on the flop',
 'If the flop is checked around and the turn appears to be unlikely to help '
 'anyone I would tend to lead out with a bet of  which is about  of the size '
 'of the pot This bet size extracts maximum value from worse made hands while '
 'giving the players who have draws the incorrect odds to continue If I get '
 'one caller and a blank falls on the river I will usually bet again for value '
 'At first glance it may not seem that my fairly large bet almost '
 'threequarters of the pot is likely to get called on the turn However I have '
 'an aggressive image which means that I will often get a call from various '
 'inferior made hands Hands that will probably call include bluff catchers '
 'such as    and  as well as marginal made hands such as JJ  and decent draws '
 'such as KJ and AJ Most reasonable opponents would fold almost all of these '
 'hands if I happened to have a tight conservative image I get paid off due to '
 'my aggressive image Player types and selfawareness It is crucially important '
 'that you are selfaware My image at the table is that of an aggressive and '
 'sometimes crazy player I got fairly lucky when I picked my online name of '
 'BigRiskky This name makes people think I am bluffing much more often than I '
 'actually am I have also been fortunate to have appeared on TV making '
 'somewhat wild plays in the past Hopefully my image as a wild player will '
 'last forever It is worth noting that it seems like I have a similar image '
 'online either because of my screen name or from people seeing me in '
 'televised tournaments My opponents view me as someone overly willing to run '
 'large bluffs in almost all situations While I certainly am capable of making '
 'unorthodox plays I normally play fairly tight and straightforward This is '
 'especially true in the early levels of a tournament It takes a very strong '
 'hand for me to commit a lot of money to the pot My opponents incorrect '
 'assumptions that I am overly aggressive often results in my large bets '
 'getting called Note that it is important to change gears throughout a '
 'tournament especially if your table will not be breaking soon While I change '
 'gears and play aggressively from time to time straightforward play is my '
 'norm When I think a spot is ripe to bluff I am not afraid to get well out of '
 'line If I happen to get caught running a large bluff I am more than happy to '
 'show it to my opponents This only reinforces my wild image I know that I am '
 'rarely bluffing but I dont want to do anything to change the preconceived '
 'image my opponents have of me You must understand your image and play in a '
 'way that reinforces that image with your opponents If you are playing a '
 'tightaggressive TAG strategy your opponents need to know you are capable of '
 'running large bluffs If they know that you will only commit a significant '
 'amount of chips with very strong hands they will simply fold or call only '
 'with drawing hands when they are getting the correct implied odds to outdraw '
 'you Planting the idea that you are capable of a big bluff will allow you to '
 'extract huge amounts of value when you are fortunate enough to make a strong '
 'hand Conversely if you are constantly running bluffs you never want your '
 'opponents to catch on You want to show your opponents the nuts whenever '
 'possible The key point is you must do everything in your power to prevent '
 'your opponents from having an accurate read of your general strategy Play a '
 'tightaggressive style Growing as a tournament player requires that you '
 'experiment with various wild plays When it makes sense you should even '
 'attempt insane plays That being said the best style for tournament poker is '
 'still TAG While players can win and have won tournaments playing like a '
 'maniac playing a TAG style leads to',
 'more consistent profit in the long run This is primarily because you will '
 'face relatively few difficult decisions for large amounts of chips Playing a '
 'TAG style limits mistakes In the long run using a TAG style means you will '
 'play better than your opponents and suffer less variance Comfort zone '
 'Regardless of the style you choose you must be comfortable playing that '
 'style If your chosen strategy has made you a winner then by all means stay '
 'with it If you are a losing player then the sooner you step out of your '
 'comfort zone the better Regardless of your comfort zone or your results if '
 'you refuse to push your boundaries you will not progress and grow as a '
 'player Most amateur players use an extremely straightforward style You '
 'simply must be comfortable raising from first position with hands like  You '
 'have to play enough hands to make you at least somewhat unpredictable '
 'Failing to do so will kill your profitability You simply cannot succeed in '
 'the long run by playing tightpassive TP or blatantly straightforward poker '
 'In order to win a poker tournament you have to run the occasional bluff and '
 'make thin value bets with marginal hands If you are a TP player making a '
 'sudden switch to a maniacal style would be detrimental Instead start slowly '
 'adding a few creative plays to your arsenal Eventually those plays will be '
 'part of your normal strategy and fit nicely into your comfort zone Soon you '
 'will find that you have switched from a TP to a TA style Use the same '
 'process if you wish to add additional looseaggressive LAG plays to your game '
 'Your opponents A lot of poker players have major ego problems They want to '
 'be the person in charge They despise getting bluffed They reraise too often '
 'They rarely give up even when it is clear their opponents have a premium '
 'hand You have to check your ego at the door in order to succeed at the '
 'higher levels of poker When you do not have ego issues you can see '
 'situations much more clearly This enables you to make better decisions '
 'allowing you to bring in consistent profits It is well known that I am not a '
 'total pushover However Im fine with getting bluffed I have absolutely no '
 'problem folding a marginal hand if the alternative is committing a large '
 'portion of my stack By the same token against players who constantly run '
 'insane plays I am also more than happy to check with a wide range giving '
 'them every opportunity to get well out of line and give me their chips Most '
 'amateur players assume their opponents blindly play in a similar style to '
 'their own This simply is not true I make it a point to try to get inside '
 'each opponents head and figure out how he thinks I figure out not only how '
 'they play but also how they perceive me One of my biggest strengths is my '
 'ability to use a small sample of hands to make assumptions about how my '
 'opponents will play in the future For example if I see someone make a huge '
 'bluff on the river I will generally assume that their smaller bets on the '
 'river tend to be for value You should rarely base your baseline reads about '
 'a player on only a few metrics Simply because a player is  years old and '
 'wearing a hoodie does not necessarily mean he is a strong online player '
 'However you must start somewhere when developing your reads Your initial '
 'reads will be based on concepts such as age and appearance but you want to '
 'focus primarily on how your opponents actually play Look for confirmation of '
 'your initial read and dont be afraid to drastically change your perception '
 'of a player if you witness conflicting information Also look for subtle '
 'changes in a players appearance and demeanor which may indicate your read is '
 'off You will make a lot of mistakes if you refuse to pay attention to what '
 'is actually happening at the table',
 'Basic player reads The generic player With an unknown player the best policy '
 'is to play a fairly TAG strategy I dont get too out of line until I have a '
 'decent idea of how this opponent will react to a specific play When playing '
 'online I confess to not giving the same attention to each table I focus on '
 'tables that are in the later stages of the tournament I assume players I do '
 'not know are playing a generic online player style until they prove '
 'otherwise In live tournaments you must make a point to focus on each hand '
 'that is played and remember roughly how each player plays each specific type '
 'of hand Clean cut quiet  guy in a Tshirt This is likely an online player '
 'with a fundamentally sound game His style is likely TAG or LAG This player '
 'thinks in terms of hand ranges They seldom give their chips away unless it '
 'is on an overly optimistic bluff Clean cut loud  guy wearing a Tshirt This '
 'player is likely a live player Live players are more comfortable with social '
 'interactions than their onlineonly counterparts Players who play only live '
 'games usually play a mix of cash games and tournaments This makes them more '
 'willing to see flops with a wide range of hands which usually results in '
 'them playing somewhat passively after the flop Young Europeanlooking kid '
 'This player is capable of getting well out of line and is almost always TAG '
 'or LAG Avoid getting involved with this player until you know which category '
 'he falls into Young kid wearing big headphones and sunglasses Expect this '
 'player to be LAG or TAG Also realize this player is probably capable of '
 'losing his mind and making insane plays Hoodiewearing  guy This is most '
 'likely an online player although he could easily be a recreational player '
 'This player can be very good or very bad Watch how he plays a few hands and '
 'youll have a decent indication as to what he is capable of Talkers Players '
 'who talk a lot at the table are more likely to be live players Pay attention '
 'to whom they are talking and what they are talking about Pay attention to '
 'accents For example if you are in New Jersey and the player talking has a '
 'New Jersey accent he is likely a local tournament or cash game player Young '
 'players with foreign accents are often strong players who travel great '
 'distances to play Players who seem to know a lot of people are likely '
 'circuit grinders or players who play a lot of local events Familiar face If '
 'I see a player who I have seen in other events but dont know who he is my '
 'assumption is he is an acceptably good but not great player These players '
 'tend to be a bit more risk averse than more',
 'successful players They tend to play solid poker especially against strong '
 'players Occasionally these players will fall on the opposite end of the '
 'spectrum This goes back to the ego problem I mentioned earlier They are on a '
 'mission to prove themselves and will try any tactic in their arsenal in '
 'order to bust a pro Regardless of where they fall on the spectrum these '
 'players are usually decent but not world class Guy in a buttoned up dress '
 'shirt Expect this player to be either TP or TAG He is almost certainly an '
 'amateur Relaxed older guy in a business suit This is usually a '
 'straightforward player although he may randomly make absurd plays at '
 'inopportune times This player often gets frustrated when you use extreme '
 'aggression against him Look to see lots of flops against him and outplay him '
 'on the later betting rounds  guy This player is reasonably straightforward '
 'and rarely gets out of line especially when a lot of money goes in the pot '
 'The experience level of this type of player varies wildly Most of them play '
 'a passive style and only apply significant pressure with premium holdings  '
 'guy This player tends to be on the tighter side even more so than his  '
 'counterpart They seldom make aggressive plays as a bluff These players also '
 'often overplay top pair They frequently limp in order to see a cheap flop '
 'and are likely to do it from any position A raise and a continuation bet '
 'from a TP player usually means they have a very strong hand unless you have '
 'seen them frequently continuation bet in similar situations Do not pay them '
 'off unless you have a premium holding Your opponents age and appearance are '
 'not the only aspects that define their play While you can make some valid '
 'generalizations be careful not to assume all players of the same age or '
 'players with the same fashion sense play in the same manner Your initial '
 'reads are by no means enough to develop a strategy for playing against a '
 'specific opponent Developing a full picture of a player is a complex puzzle '
 'You need to piece the various bits of information together in order to '
 'develop a strong baseline read I make a point to dig a bit deeper and try to '
 'understand why a person acts in a particular manner Once I can figure out '
 'where a player is coming from I am better able to figure out how he is '
 'likely to play against me Determine the type of hands your opponents play It '
 'seems like some players pay attention to everything besides poker I make a '
 'point to pay full attention while at the poker table There is a wealth of '
 'information to be gained simply by keeping your eyes open and following the '
 'action You should put every player on a range of hands during each and every '
 'hand you witness Even when you miss the preflop action it is not too '
 'difficult to figure out what happened Focus on what type of hands your '
 'opponents are willing to invest a significant portion of their stack with I '
 'suggest you focus on making the simple reads first A player who raises to  '
 'on the first hand of the day is most likely a live cash game player who may '
 'not know what he is doing It is a wellknown fact',
 'that players who make large raises are usually cash game players or amateurs '
 'If someone minraises early in a tournament I will quickly assume he is an '
 'online player A player who constantly makes continuation bets or checks back '
 'marginal made hands is also likely an online player A player who only makes '
 'continuation bets with strong hands clearly plays a weak tight '
 'straightforward strategy You will find that most players have a particular '
 'point in the hand where they will fold to significant aggression The easiest '
 'players to play against are those who will fold to preflop or flop '
 'aggression You can simply steal the pot when they do not have a premium hand '
 'by  preflop or raising their continuation bets Most players who are a bit '
 'sticky on the flop will fold to significant turn aggression Some of the '
 'wildest players wait until the river before giving up on a hand Note that if '
 'you are up against an extreme calling station running a pure bluff is '
 'useless They will almost never fold to any amount of aggression When you '
 'bluff you are handing them your chips Capitalize on specific situations You '
 'should play very differently when playing against someone who will '
 'frequently fold top pair to significant aggression compared to someone who '
 'will never do this Even though both players are making huge errors they are '
 'making the exact opposite error If you fail to pay attention you will not '
 'capitalize on these highly profitable situations For example I recently '
 'played against someone who thought top pair should be folded to a raise on '
 'the flop or the turn I made a point to frequently raise the flop against '
 'that player with any two cards knowing he would be quick to ditch anything '
 'less than a premium hand Recently some of the tougher European players have '
 'been overly sticky on the flop and turn rarely folding to any bet However on '
 'the river they are capable of making large folds They assume that if you are '
 'willing to invest on each betting round you must have a strong hand because '
 'it should be clear to you that they have something decent If you know they '
 'have a decent hand you must have a better one After all who would be crazy '
 'enough to try to bluff a strong European kid That being said the best play '
 'is usually to avoid strong players who will constantly force you to put your '
 'entire stack in the pot You win tournaments by avoiding significant amounts '
 'of risk If you constantly run large bluffs you will eventually get caught If '
 'I have recently reraised the same player a few times in a row I tend to '
 'assume they will continue to take the same line against me until they prove '
 'they are capable of fighting back Do not fall into the trap of thinking your '
 'opponents must be taking a stand against you because you have been abusing '
 'them Most players are simply not capable of fighting back They recognize '
 'that they are being abused but are too weak to do anything about it Instead '
 'they will tighten up and wait for a premium hand before playing a large pot '
 'with you When they show a willingness to commit a huge amount of chips to '
 'the pot you should only continue with your absolute best holdings For '
 'example a TP player raises from middle position I  from the button with K  '
 'Now if he  I will fold no matter how frustrated I think he is I will not get '
 'fancy and put in the  It is worth noting that I usually  with a polarized '
 'range I do not  hands with which I definitely want to see a flop such as  or '
 'AJ I apply pressure to my opponent and reraise with a wide range of hands '
 'that have postflop potential If he does get frustrated and makes a move I '
 'can easily fold junky hands such as   preflop I think that most players who '
 'have a marginal amount of success reraise way too often before the flop',
 'Their goal is to make the pot huge and play headsup versus weak players They '
 'willingly give up the opportunity to play pots with a very deep stacktopot '
 'ratio These players fail to realize that with a deep stack you can usually '
 'figure out how to play a huge pot after the flop when you happen to make a '
 'strong hand Especially when playing against bad players it doesnt matter too '
 'much if there was a  preflop Bad players will find a way to invest way too '
 'much money with the worst hand regardless of the size of the pot preflop Of '
 'course there is some value in reraising when if you call you will be out of '
 'position against strong players who have yet to act By reraising you will '
 'usually force the strong players to fold However this concern is somewhat '
 'negligible Your main goal should be to see as many flops as possible when in '
 'position against the worst players at the table At times you will want to '
 'reraise if a player yet to act is known to squeeze reraise following a raise '
 'and a call frequently Against an habitual squeezer you should mix up your '
 'play With strong hands you should strongly consider calling hoping to induce '
 'the squeezer to reraise with a hand you have crushed I recently played a '
 'hand in the late stages of a major event that beautifully illustrates this '
 'concept A weak player raised to  out of his  stack from middle position I '
 'knew that two of the players to my left liked to squeeze so I simply called '
 'with AA As expected the button moved allin for  the initial raiser folded '
 'and I instantly called winning a huge pot from AJo If I reraised the initial '
 'raiser the squeezer would have likely folded his AJ costing me a ton of '
 'equity By calling I got my opponent to put in his entire stack drawing '
 'almost dead There is a lot of value in keeping the pot small before the flop '
 'and hoping to flop well Many players especially amateurs are unlikely to '
 'realize that you only give significant action when you have premium hands '
 'All they see is you playing lots of flops with a wide range of hands and '
 'making numerous small stabs at the pot As long as you give a little action '
 'your opponents will be willing to give you a huge amount of action when you '
 'want it Making logical deductions I cant overstate the importance of being '
 'observant and paying attention at the poker table Be sure to take note of '
 'all of the default plays your opponents make If someone constantly bets on '
 'every street he simply must be bluffing a large percentage of the time If '
 'someone frequently checks the turn you can be sure he is pot controlling '
 'with a lot of marginal made hands Even though you may not actually see these '
 'hands shown down you can make logical deductions I make a mental note '
 'whenever I see someone display what I perceive to be an exploitable tendency '
 'I also decide how I can exploit that specific error in the future If someone '
 'is firing two bullets with air I think This guy two barrels a lot with air '
 'therefore I should consider raising the turn when I have nothing and calling '
 'the turn with my marginal made hands to keep my opponent in the pot with all '
 'of his bluffs Make a plan for future hands instead of simply noting This guy '
 'two barrels a lot with air Whenever you enter a pot with someone you have '
 'played with in the past try to recount the tendencies you have seen him '
 'display This will help you plan your actions on every street If you know a '
 'player plays in a blatantly straightforward manner on the turn your goal '
 'should be to get to the turn and then see what develops This means you will '
 'often have to call a flop bet with a wide range On the turn your plan is to '
 'bet if this opponent checks and only call a bet with strong holdings I have '
 'found that when I talk to a player I tend to remember him much more vividly '
 'compared to when I simply notice him Being personable at the table will make '
 'some players take the game less seriously',
 'simply notice him Being personable at the table will make some players take '
 'the game less seriously This will often induce them to give off tells or '
 'play a bit too passively If someone enjoys talking to you they will give you '
 'free information Amateur players are the most likely player type to play '
 'differently on a daytoday basis If they are',
 'tired they may play tight An argument with their significant other could '
 'lead to untimely aggression If they recently decided to devote a lot of time '
 'to studying the game they will probably play better than normal or make a '
 'point to try a new play they learned That being said if you realize a bad '
 'player is making his normal poor decisions in a particular session assume he '
 'will continue making those bad decisions until it becomes clear he has '
 'improved at poker Stealing pots Stealing small pots is an excellent way to '
 'build your chip stack The benefit of constantly stealing small pots is that '
 'you gain the luxury of being able to bypass big pots where a single mistake '
 'can end your tournament The key to stealing is to figure out how your '
 'opponent plays in small pots Often amateur players play too '
 'straightforwardly on the flop or the turn Once you have a good handle on how '
 'they play make a point to put yourself in steal situations that are not too '
 'costly when they fail Using your reads As a result of spending countless '
 'hours at the table I have developed a strong intuition regarding the '
 'strength of a players hand I do not consciously focus too much on physical '
 'tells Good intuitive instincts are a direct result of experience I developed '
 'my intuition from a variety of past observations including physical tells '
 'betting patterns and demeanor Although most of my reads are subconscious I '
 'am usually willing to follow them even when there is a lot of money on the '
 'line If you are new to poker be careful when following your intuition as you '
 'most likely have not spent the requisite amount of time at the table It is '
 'important to know that your reads are actually strong before following them '
 'Even though I have a great deal of confidence in my reads I do not blindly '
 'trust them That being said when I fail to trust my reads it seems like bad '
 'things happen In the recent WPT  tournament at Aria we were down to three '
 'players I was confident that my opponent who had been completely in line all '
 'day was bluffing My subconscious was screaming at me that he was bluffing My '
 'logical thought process was that there was simply no way he could bluff in '
 'that specific situation I trusted logic and folded third pair on the river '
 'Of course as soon as I folded my opponent showed me the welltimed bluff Not '
 'trusting my read cost me a huge amount of equity Focus at the table If you '
 'try to focus on every single action your opponents make you will drive '
 'yourself crazy If you ignore innocuous actions such as simple preflop raises '
 'and continuation bets you will be more alert and better able to pay '
 'attention when it matters the most I make it a point to focus on the betting '
 'action in hands that have the potential to become significant such as when '
 'there is a reraise on the flop or I see lots of chips going in the pot on '
 'the turn Be sure to pay attention to the hands that are shown down Most '
 'players make their largest mistakes on the turn and the river so pay '
 'particular attention on those streets I have been lucky in that I was born '
 'with a mind that allows me to pay attention to numerous things at the same '
 'time Even if I am on my phone or reading an article I am able to follow the '
 'preflop and flop action reasonably well I can shift my attention to the '
 'action at the table when an important pot develops If you know that you '
 'arent unable to multitask well I strongly suggest you give poker your full '
 'attention',
 'There are better times to watch sports or play on your phone Defining good '
 'and bad players Simply quantifying someone as good or bad is not nearly '
 'enough to develop a winning strategy There are almost no players who are bad '
 'at everything In todays game most players are decently good at most things '
 'but have a few disastrous leaks If you can pinpoint exactly what someone '
 'does incorrectly you will be able to use that information to your advantage '
 'I make a point to get involved with each player in areas where I know they '
 'have leaks allowing me to extract value Heres a simple rule that will allow '
 'you to make deeper runs in poker tournaments When you expect your opponents '
 'to play well stay out of their way You should make a point to play most of '
 'your pots against the weakest players at the table You will find that most '
 'of your wins will not be because you outplayed strong opponents but because '
 'you gave yourself the opportunity to get involved with weak opponents You '
 'will find that widening your preflop range a bit when you know you will be '
 'involved with a weak player is usually a good idea Of course when you first '
 'arrive at a table you may not know your opponents When I initially get to a '
 'table I try to figure out how everyone thinks about poker Then as I '
 'mentioned before I assume they will play roughly how they look I adjust my '
 'assessment quickly based on how they actually play Notice if you fail to pay '
 'attention you will only have generic reads to go on which will not be nearly '
 'as useful as accurate reads It is mandatory to realize and accept that your '
 'default reads will occasionally be way off Pay attention and be willing to '
 'change your assumptions I recently played with a guy who looked acted and '
 'talked like a professional player After playing with him for a while I came '
 'to realize that he was actually terrible It is important to pay attention '
 'when the pots get large and when hands go to the showdown Quite often a '
 'player will take a betting line such that there is realistically no hand he '
 'should play in that manner That is often a good indication that the player '
 'is an amateur Identifying good and bad players Preflop bet sizes can tell '
 'you a great deal about a player In general online players are much better '
 'than live players in this regard because they have put in a lot more volume '
 'Online players typically play a solid fundamental preflop and postflop '
 'strategy Online players tend to make smaller preflop raises in hopes of '
 'playing a big pot primarily when they flop a strong hand You will '
 'occasionally find a bad online player but for the most part they are strong '
 'players One of the benefits of keeping the pot small preflop is that you get '
 'to see many more rivers where most weak players fail to apply nearly enough '
 'pressure A player who constantly makes large preflop raises or reraises is '
 'likely a live player Live players are usually much more prone to play too '
 'loose and passive before and on the flop but tend to be tight and '
 'straightforward on the turn and river If you see someone taking bizarre '
 'lines they are often a bad player Most of the standard betting lines are '
 'standard because they work While I certainly think there is a lot of value '
 'in mixing up your play and keeping your opponents guessing most of the time '
 'you will find that the best strategy is simply to stay in line You have to '
 'know in what way a player is bad If you know a guy is going to make a large '
 'bet when he his bluffing you can make a very easy call with marginal made '
 'hands You will find that some players do',
 'the opposite betting large when they have premium hands hoping to extract '
 'maximum value One of the best player types to target is those who play in a '
 'blatantly straightforward manner after the flop Against these players you '
 'can call their preflop raises in position with a very wide range On the flop '
 'simply fold to a continuation bet when you have nothing and bet with your '
 'entire range when they check to you Some players play decently well preflop '
 'and on the flop but play poorly on the turn They will raise with a wide '
 'range preflop always make a continuation bet and then play very '
 'straightforwardly on the turn Against these players you want to get to the '
 'turn planning to steal the pot when they check The players who play badly on '
 'the river present a good opportunity to add chips to your stack Even though '
 'it may seem like I am getting well out of line to exploit these players I am '
 'not making these plays with blatantly crazy hands I like to have a bit of '
 'value when looking to exploit my opponents just in case my reads are '
 'incorrect I look for ways to exploit players without risking my entire stack '
 'Your play on the early streets directly influences your play on the later '
 'streets By applying significant pressure early you force your opponents to '
 'have strong ranges when they continue in the pot This makes it difficult for '
 'you to win a big pot on the turn or river unless you happen to also have a '
 'premium hand By calling when your opponent bets instead of raising you force '
 'him to stay in the pot with a wide range allowing you to steal numerous pots '
 'with turn and river bets that while significant do not risk much of your '
 'stack Playing against professionals Before we proceed it is important to '
 'define a pro A pro for our discussion is someone who plays tournaments '
 'consistently and wins money in the long run Someone who plays the occasional '
 'tournament and has a few wins may be good but is not a pro In the early '
 'stages of a tournament amateur players seem to think that pros are '
 'continually showing aggression and putting a lot of chips in the pot without '
 'strong hands They think they are bluffing with a much higher frequency than '
 'is reasonably possible This leads some amateurs to make terrible calls that '
 'cost them a lot of chips or even eliminates them early in a tournament When '
 'you are playing a marginal hand such as top pair decent kicker against a pro '
 'checking with the intention of calling most reasonable bets is a valid play '
 'Raising the flop with this marginal made hand gives the pro the opportunity '
 'to win a ton of chips when you are beat and to fold when you are ahead Early '
 'in a tournament the pros who have continuous success are not the ones '
 'blindly bluffing off their stack You simply cannot constantly make deep runs '
 'if you frequently bluff off your stack in the first few levels As a simple '
 'example suppose a pro raises and an amateur who is getting frustrated with '
 'the pro calls with KQ in position The flop comes Kxx The pro continuation '
 'bets the amateur raises and the pro calls When a pro calls a raise in this '
 'situation he will usually have KQ crushed By raising the amateur allows the '
 'pro to fold when he has a marginal made hands or total junk It also allows '
 'him to get maximum value when he has the amateur beat because the pot will '
 'be gigantic going to the turn While raising the flop with KQ perhaps has a '
 'bit of merit most amateurs compound the error by betting again on the turn '
 'spewing huge amounts of chips to the pro In a similar example an amateur '
 'raises with KQ the pro calls and the flop is once again Kxx The amateur '
 'makes a continuation bet and the pro raises The amateur is in a miserably '
 'bad spot Quite often the amateur refuses to fold feeling that the pro must '
 'be pushing him around This usually results in the amateur losing a huge '
 'amount of his stack to the pros better hand Playing large pots out of '
 'position with',
 'amateur losing a huge amount of his stack to the pros better hand Playing '
 'large pots out of position with marginal made hands when the stacks are deep '
 'is a recipe for disaster Amateurs fail to recognize that these hands are '
 'bluff catchers Raising with KQ on a Kxx flop is a',
 'terrible play because it allows the pro to know exactly what the amateur has '
 'assuming he rarely raises in this spot as a bluff Playing against a total '
 'amateur If you find yourself against someone who is likely a total amateur '
 'avoid large pots with anything less than very strong hands These players '
 'will give you many opportunities to extract value as the tournament '
 'progresses without risking your stack Spotting a total amateur is fairly '
 'simple You can usually tell that they simply dont belong at the table A '
 'beautiful woman dressed liked a model someone who cant handle their chips or '
 'a middleaged guy who doesnt know the basic mechanics of the game are all '
 'likely to be total amateurs Say it is the first orbit of the tournament and '
 'everyone started with  chips The blinds are  One of the total amateurs limps '
 'from first position Another player limps and you raise to  with JJ in '
 'position If the original limper reraises to  you should happily fold the '
 'jacks While you could have this player crushed you will easily be able to '
 'find better spots in the future against this player Going broke even with a '
 'hand like JJ is disastrous so early in a tournament Dealing with player '
 'adjustments Some decently strong players fold to small  too often When I '
 'have a hand that has any sort of postflop potential I happily call small  '
 'and see the flop Few players who make small  are skillful enough to give '
 'their opponents such amazing preflop pot odds You should usually call with '
 'your hands that have implied odds and consider  with your hands that dont '
 'have implied odds Folding is usually a poor option except with hands that '
 'tend to be easily dominated such as  and K  Recently I have encountered many '
 'players who are capable of bluffraising and bluffcheckraising on the river '
 'While I cant say that I have figured out the optimal strategy in these '
 'situations I have started to make adjustments prior to committing to any '
 'river bet against these players Before betting I determine if I can '
 'reasonably call if they raise If I will be in a tough spot or may even be '
 'forced to fold a decent made hand I check to avoid getting blown off my hand '
 'Their aggressive river play almost certainly forces me to miss out on '
 'relatively thin value bets Their style of play reinforces the premise that '
 'any time you can force an opponent to make an adjustment that results in him '
 'losing value you should add it to your game Betting simply because they '
 'think they are ahead is one of the biggest mistakes that amateurs make It is '
 'important to think ahead about all of your bets You must think your opponent '
 'will call your value bet more than  of the time with a worse hand than yours '
 'You must also consider what you will do if he raises If you cant stand a '
 'raise which may make you fold the best hand you should usually check That '
 'being said against players who frequently bluffraise on the river I have no '
 'problem valuebetting with marginal made hands with the intention of calling '
 'a raise This allows me to get maximum value from my marginal hand Although a '
 'river raise is usually an indication of strength that is not necessarily '
 'true for all players Once again you have to know your opponents Pick your '
 'competition I try to play a lot of hands against amateurs and fewer hands '
 'against the strong players This is because amateurs rarely put me in tough '
 'spots My goal is to put my opponents in positions where they will make',
 'costly mistakes If my opponents rarely do the same to me they allow me to '
 'play well That means I will make money in the long run I also figure out '
 'which plays my opponents make that give me trouble and then add those plays '
 'to my arsenal For example while I do not bluffraise the river often I will '
 'raise the river with a balanced range when facing specific opponents who I '
 'think are capable of valuebetting with a wide range You should always figure '
 'out ways to put your opponents in spots where they will be forced to make '
 'difficult decisions leading to them making significant errors that put money '
 'in your pocket Pros apply pressure later in the tournament As you get deeper '
 'in a tournament you will find that those previously cautious pros become a '
 'bit more willing to run large bluffs They are looking to apply maximum '
 'pressure especially against amateur players and those who are clearly '
 'looking to get in the money In general amateur players fold too often in '
 'high pressure situations when they should be calling or reraising as the '
 'money bubble approaches Heres a typical situation In the late stages of a '
 'tournament an amateur player raises  or  out of his  stack with AJ The pro '
 'reraises to  and the amateur folds Folding is the worst possible play '
 'Folding makes it nearly impossible to accumulate a big stack The probable '
 'best play in this situation is to move allin Amateurs think that if they '
 'push they are resigning themselves to a coin flip In reality they will often '
 'be flipping when called However they have a huge amount of fold equity and '
 'will often win the pot with no showdown You need to win way less than  of '
 'the time in these situations since you already have invested some percentage '
 'of your stack in the pot Even if the reraiser rarely folds pushing is still '
 'the correct play Dont be afraid to take risks You cant be afraid of risking '
 'your stack late in a tournament especially when the pros start applying '
 'extreme pressure In fact avoiding risks in the late stages of a tournament '
 'by playing tightly is a much more risky strategy than playing aggressively '
 'if your goal is to win Pros realize that it is acceptable to go broke '
 'Amateur players are willing to go broke early in tournaments but not in the '
 'late stages Amateurs have their priorities the wrong way round Heres an '
 'example from the WPT  The WPT  is a  guaranteed event held at the Aria There '
 'was a last chance Day  flight that started on the morning of Day  The event '
 'had a turbo blind structure and  minute levels When we got in the money the '
 'average stack was  which was a fairly short stack I estimate that I stole  '
 'chips on the bubble because no one wanted to go broke The structure of the '
 'tournament had a big impact on the decisions many players made Once we were '
 'in the money the top  would advance with their chips to Day  of the main '
 'tournament Once in the main they would be playing with smaller blinds longer '
 'levels and a substantially larger prize pool It became apparent to me that '
 'everyone was trying to make the top  which created a dream scenario for me I '
 'started to go allin with any two cards with very little fear simply because '
 'no one was willing to go broke My mindset was I need to build chips in order '
 'to give myself the best chance of making a deep run My opponents mindset was '
 'I need to play super tight to withstand the constantly increasing blinds I '
 'stole a ton of chips which helped me finish third in the WPT  and take home  '
 'Phil Ivey said it best',
 'Late in a tournament my strategy depends a lot on my opponents Phil Ivey '
 'said it best When your table is playing tight you play aggressive and when '
 'your table is playing aggressive you play tight Playing the opposite of '
 'everyone else at your table is almost always the best strategy Most amateurs '
 'assume that pros play against everyone in the same manner That is simply not '
 'the case I make a point to see many more flops against the amateurs I tend '
 'to not isolate the amateurs by reraising as often as most players because I '
 'dont mind seeing a cheap flop especially when I am in position Against pros '
 'I am much more inclined to reraise Against amateurs I am much happier seeing '
 'flops in hopes of making a strong hand before I commit a lot of my stack By '
 'keeping the pots small I give myself many more opportunities to flop a '
 'strong hand If I frequently reraise I may win a few small pots before the '
 'flop but run the risk of bloating the pot to the point that just a few '
 'unfortunate hands can bust me My goal is to hang around and to give my weak '
 'opponents as much time as possible to make a devastating mistake When '
 'deepstacked against an amateur Im quite prone to call with a hand like   and '
 'hope for a good flop Against the pros I am more inclined to slow play hands '
 'like AA and KK in order to put the pro to a tough decision on a later street '
 'It will appear that I am calling quiet often However the range I call with '
 'against a pro is drastically different to the range Ill call with against an '
 'amateur By showing a varying range in similar situations I confuse my '
 'opponents and force them to make mistakes The pros if they are paying '
 'attention will eventually realize that Im making the calls with different '
 'ranges and adjust accordingly which will force me to revert back to a fairly '
 'standard  or fold strategy Tough and soft tournaments In a recent major '
 'large buyin tournament we were near the bubble when a good but superloose '
 'aggressive player raised to  from middle position I was on the button and '
 'simply called with AK To most players this is an automatic reraise situation '
 'I think this is an excellent calling situation If you reraise the super '
 'loose aggressive player will often call and put you in a tricky situations '
 'after the flop By calling I allowed myself to see a flop in position with a '
 'disguised range However if this was a soft online tournament such as the  '
 'Sunday Million on PokerStars I would be much more prone to reraise or even '
 'go allin In this scenario my opponents will be much more inclined to get '
 'allin with numerous hands I have dominated It is important to think about '
 'the type of mistakes your opponents are likely to make and adjust your '
 'strategy to take advantage of them While this may at first glance seem '
 'counterintuitive there is more value in conserving your stack in a soft '
 'tournament than in a tough tournament By reraising you make it less likely '
 'to find yourself in a difficult situation when you are facing weak '
 'competition In soft tournaments you are often able to slowly grind up your '
 'stack by stealing This makes playing any meaningful size pot postflop a bad '
 'idea In tough tournaments it is difficult to steal You have to be willing to '
 'take more risks to see flops in position If you play poorly after the flop '
 'it is probably best to just reraise as that lessens the likelihood of making '
 'bad decisions postflop Final table strategy At final tables I am usually '
 'very aggressive Most of the money is reserved for the top few spots It is '
 'worth the risk of going out  or  in exchange for a real shot at winning the '
 'tournament As soon as my opponents start altering their strategy I will '
 'adjust mine If it is clear that everyone is going to gamble hard to try to '
 'take first place I am fine sitting back and waiting for a strong hand This '
 'gives me an',
 'excellent shot to take one of the top three spots with relatively little '
 'risk Taking a step back is acceptable if the table is tough and no one is '
 'going to let you push them around Quite often once a few players are '
 'eliminated the dynamics of the table will change allowing you to go back '
 'into an aggressive mode Tilt Bad beats hurt but they are unavoidable and are '
 'guaranteed to happen If a bad beat eliminates me in the early or middle '
 'stages of a tournament I take it as a blessing in disguise and head out to '
 'enjoy the rest of the day I try to keep everything in perspective I realize '
 'I will not win or even cash in most of the tournaments I play The only way '
 'to approach poker is to play one hand at a time and do your best The only '
 'time I get upset is when I make a mistake You cannot fix a bad beat but you '
 'can fix bad play In a recent major WCOOP tournament with seven players left '
 'I was allin for the chip lead with AQ against  When I lost and was '
 'eliminated I sat there in a daze for a bit but didnt go on tilt I played the '
 'hand correctly If I had made a mistake I would have been much more upset Bad '
 'beats happen Get over them This doesnt mean that I never feel pain from a '
 'bad beat Early in my career before I had a big score I was playing the WCOOP '
 'Main Event I played a large pot with KQ vs  Winning the pot would have made '
 'me a strong contender to win  I felt good with the KJx flop but sat there in '
 'a daze when I got out drawn on the river I realized that I did not make a '
 'mistake and continued to play my best game I make a point to not think about '
 'money at all during poker tournaments It is best to simply recognize that if '
 'you play good poker you will win money in the long run as long as you are '
 'better than your opponents While losing huge pots is never fun it is part of '
 'the game You must learn to accept occasionally losing a big pot if you want '
 'to play tournaments successfully No matter how bad a beat hurts it is '
 'important to have respect for yourself Dont have an outburst If you appear '
 'poised even in the most trying situations your opponents will think you are '
 'totally immune to pain This makes you much stronger than the average poker '
 'player You do not want to let anyone know that anything gets to you '
 'Otherwise your opponents can and will use that information against you and '
 'do everything in their power to put you on tilt For example if you get '
 'tilted when someone constantly reraises you then if a player knows that he '
 'can reraise you often and put you on tilt If you seem to be fine with '
 'getting reraised and occasionally fight back your opponent may change his '
 'strategy He certainly wont be making plays simply because he is trying to '
 'put you on tilt I know a few players who really hate being raised on the '
 'flop Especially when the stacks are deep I call their preflop raises with a '
 'wide range and then raise on most flops Even if I lose the current hand I '
 'set them up to lose their minds against me in the future when I actually '
 'flop a premium hand Downswings I was not initially an online player I '
 'started in live home games and eventually gravitated to online poker One of '
 'the most enlightening experiences of my poker career happened when online '
 'poker started getting tougher One day I went on a fairly big downswing I '
 'realized that I was not playing in an optimal manner Plays that worked in '
 'the past no longer worked I spent a lot of time talking with my friends '
 'about hands and the tactics they were using to succeed As a result my '
 'strategy improved significantly You should figure out',
 'why good players are making specific plays and using specific ideas then add '
 'them to your strategy This experience taught me that you must learn how '
 'everyone thinks whether they are good or bad at poker Players often complain '
 'about how their opponents played a hand poorly and yet won a huge pot They '
 'fail to realize that their mistake was not knowing what mistakes their '
 'opponents were likely to make way before that particular hand occurred You '
 'must figure out what your opponents do incorrectly if you want to be able to '
 'alter your strategy to take advantage of their mistakes Study and support I '
 'have found that the most beneficial way for me to improve at poker is to '
 'discuss tricky situations with players who I think are worldclass Sometimes '
 'a tricky hand will come up I make a point to remember the hand and then '
 'discuss it with all of my friends I have found that I mostly ask about '
 'marginal spots Occasionally Ill ask about a hand and have everyone agree '
 'that I played it really well or really poorly This helps clarify situations '
 'for me as sometimes spots I thought of as marginal are actually fairly '
 'standard By talking to excellent players I learn what they are thinking '
 'which allows me to figure out what my worldclass opponents are thinking A '
 'good support group is one of the most valuable tools of a professional poker '
 'player I consider it crucial if you want to survive in the poker world I am '
 'good at figuring out my flaws However having a close group of friends you '
 'can discuss ideas with is incredibly beneficial Your support group will help '
 'with everything from bad runs to bad plays It is nice to have someone who '
 'will support you with your troubles in all aspects of life In my group of '
 'close poker friends it is not uncommon for perhaps three out of ten players '
 'to be on a downswing at any given moment When that is the case the other '
 'seven guys reassure them and discuss hands with them to make sure they arent '
 'making costly mistakes Usually one person in the group is doing really well '
 'at the tables If you know that you play as well as the hot player you know '
 'that your hot streak will also come given time Intense downswings can be '
 'disheartening and discouraging Your support group will help you to continue '
 'to play your best even when times are tough Plus sometimes you just need to '
 'vent A strong support group allows you to vent and get rid of all the '
 'selfdestructive feelings With the negative thoughts out of the way you can '
 'then go back to playing excellent poker I have been lucky in that nothing '
 'tends to keep me awake at night I have played poker professionally for long '
 'enough that the pressures that come with the game are fairly normal to me If '
 'I have been on a bad streak or made mistakes that cost me significant money '
 'those will certainly be on my mind Instead of losing sleep over them I work '
 'hard to correct the mistakes and become a better player Two of the concepts '
 'I have mentioned previously play into my ability to avoid sleepless nights '
 'The first goes back to ego I know I will make mistakes at the poker table '
 'and so will you It is virtually impossible to play perfectly or to make the '
 'correct adjustments every time The second is selfawareness The knowledge '
 'that you are correcting mistakes and knowing that variance is part of the '
 'game goes a long way to ease your mind Fitness Another factor that '
 'contributes to sleeping well and helps with your stamina and mental agility '
 'at the table is staying in shape Poker often involves long hours of play I '
 'developed the conditioning to play these long hours by staying in good '
 'physical shape I go to the gym or run every day before I play poker Even '
 'when I get a',
 'couple less hours of sleep than normal I have tons of extra energy '
 'throughout the day Once I finish my workout I make sure that I have time to '
 'relax and calm my mind before heading to the tournament For me working out '
 'is far harder than playing poker Once I have completed a difficult workout '
 'playing poker seems easy I have always been in relatively good shape However '
 'once I started playing a lot of poker my level of fitness began to decline '
 'due to the amount of time I spent sitting at the poker table I realized the '
 'benefits of being in amazing shape and made a determined effort to get back '
 'in and stay in excellent condition I have a bit of an obsessive personality '
 'and tend to go all out in every endeavor I tackle Challenging myself and '
 'pushing my boundaries are enjoyable to me Just as you have to push your '
 'boundaries at the poker table you have to do the same when you work out if '
 'you want to see rapid progress You cant stick to the same routine all the '
 'time You have to force yourself to improve You will find that completing new '
 'challenges is exciting and will keep you engaged The feeling of success and '
 'completion leads you to forget any worries you may have from poker Skipping '
 'my workout is not an option and is perhaps my most important daily task When '
 'I have a day off from my typical workout routine I still get in some cardio '
 'work My usual choice is to run about three miles at a fast pace My workouts '
 'provide the perfect counterbalance to poker It is quite difficult to lose a '
 'tournament and realize that I actually did an excellent job When I work out '
 'there is no doubt that I did a good job Having an activity in your life '
 'where you can definitively determine the results provides a nice '
 'counterbalance to poker where you cannot control the results Getting started '
 'in the gym Here are some tips for getting started in the gym Hire a personal '
 'trainer for a few sessions The trainer will teach you to use all the '
 'equipment correctly and will set up a routine that you can follow Work out '
 'with a friend This will help motivate you You will find that if someone '
 'holds you accountable you will be much more likely to complete your goals '
 'Join a group class This develops a structure that demands you show up on '
 'time and complete your workout Warm up before your workout Wearing warm '
 'clothes to before you start your workout will get your blood flowing I also '
 'drink a cup of coffee before my workout Make a plan for your workout Dont '
 'just wander from machine to machine I carry a timer with me at the gym When '
 'my rest time is complete I immediately move to my next workout station Find '
 'a routine that works and stick with it for at least six or eight weeks Then '
 'look for a tougher one If you strive to do a little better every day you '
 'will drastically improve over time Resolve to make your workout routine a '
 'part of your life Skipping your routine should never be an option just as '
 'you take a shower or brush your teeth each day I will get less sleep or skip '
 'spending time in a restaurant in order to make time for the gym It is one of '
 'my top priorities because I realize its importance Diet The other part of '
 'being mentally and physically at your best is your diet For the most part I '
 'maintain a fairly healthy diet I consume a high amount of protein and a lot '
 'of vegetables I burn around  to  calories each day and I try to take in that '
 'many calories My',
 'caloric intake is extremely high due to my strenuous workout schedule My '
 'protein consumption is high to repair and build my muscles I imagine your '
 'calorie intake should be much lower perhaps around  to  calories per day '
 'depending on your level of activity If you are working out and building '
 'muscle eat a bit more If you are sitting at a poker table all day eat a bit '
 'less If you are trying to lose weight cut out excess calories such as '
 'butters oils dressings cheeses and other foods that are high in calories but '
 'low in nutrients For breakfast I tend to have egg whites with some sort of '
 'lean protein such as turkey bacon or salmon For lunch I usually have some '
 'kind of sandwich with double meat but no sauces My wife and I cook at home '
 'every night and our basic dinner is always the same chicken steak or salmon '
 'green vegetables and a salad When you are traveling it sometimes takes a bit '
 'more effort to stick to a healthy diet An egg white omelet is a good '
 'breakfast choice that you can find at most casino cafes Burrito bowls that '
 'consist of only beans lettuce meat and tomatoes are an excellent lunch and '
 'dinner option Fajita dishes are also good when you are on the road I '
 'frequently take food with me when I travel I grill chicken freeze it and '
 'pack it in a cold bag in my luggage I also take some sort of protein mix or '
 'protein bars with me In general I tend to avoid supplements and protein '
 'powders The nutrients in real food are much easier for your body to absorb '
 'and use I only take protein powders as a last resort such as when Im not '
 'able to find the food I need when Im on the road Develop a routine You have '
 'to approach poker like a job I find that sticking to a routine helps me play '
 'my best I have found that when I get away from my routine things seem to '
 'fall apart When Im playing a poker tournament I wake up a few hours before '
 'the tournament starts I have some coffee do my workout routine eat breakfast '
 'relax for a while and then play poker When I am running low on time I '
 'occasionally eat my breakfast at the poker table Especially when traveling I '
 'make a point to figure out the things that will make getting in the gym '
 'difficult and solve those problems ahead of time I have found that it is '
 'quite easy to maintain my routine perfectly if I plan ahead I have made a '
 'point to determine what I want in life and I take steps to make those things '
 'happen By defining what I want out of life I move in those directions and '

 ' TOURNAMENT STRATEGIES Introduction Even after playing tournament poker '
 'professionally for six years it remains the most interesting form of the '
 'game for me to discuss Growing up playing sitngo and small stakes '
 'tournaments I developed the drive and motivation I still use to this day The '
 'search for that lifechanging score is something that drives many players to '
 'tournament poker Through all the variance bad beats and close calls like '
 'many of you Im still driven and motivated by the constantly changing '
 'dynamics of tournament poker With the ebb and flow of chip stacks players '
 'busting out and tables breaking down toward that final table each tournament '
 'is unique and results in a huge number of strategic situations This dynamic '
 'nature of the game provides the stimulation that keeps me coming back for '
 'more There is no better excitement in poker then playing for the big bucks '
 'The adrenaline rush that comes with the final few tables of a major '
 'televised event is my fuel I have played almost all of the styles that are '
 'prevalent in todays tournaments From online tournament robotic play to the '
 'feel play of live events Ive reached where I am today through a combination '
 'of all the strategies learned through the million plus hands of poker I have '
 'played Not until the past few years have the skills of game flow and feel '
 'been developed as an integral part of my game With an emphasis on small to '
 'middle stakes large field events I have developed strategies that I feel are '
 'effective in beating todays games By taking advantage of weak players and '
 'putting them in uncomfortable situations I give myself the most '
 'opportunities throughout an event to build a significant chip stack Why In '
 'evaluating your poker game one of the most important words is only three '
 'letters why Why do you do anything in poker One of the biggest yet hardest '
 'steps for amateur players is to justify their own decisions They lack the '
 'ability to describe in detail why they chose a specific action Why did they '
 'raise the turn Why did they  preflop In this chapter I will propose a lot of '
 'questions that you should constantly ask yourself not only during play but '
 'afterwards when you evaluate your play I hope to give you a deeper '
 'understanding as to why you should take certain actions You will discover '
 'the tools you need to develop and learn while assessing your game Most '
 'importantly I will teach you what to look out for reasons to get involved in '
 'pots and ways to think outside of the box allowing you to step away from '
 'robotic thinking Your shortterm goals within each individual hand of poker '
 'should be fairly simple make better decisions than your opponents while '
 'simultaneously creating opportunities for them to make costly mistakes '
 'Capitalizing on mistakes is a key to becoming a successful player The first '
 'levels of a',
 'tournament when the stacks are the deepest present a lot of opportunities '
 'for you to take advantage not only of your opponents mistakes but of some of '
 'their big mistakes This is the part of the tournament where you get to see '
 'the most flops the most turns and most importantly the most rivers In these '
 'situations we are looking to help our villains make major blunders This is '
 'the most fun part of a tournament because you dont have to fold a lot Im not '
 'going sit here and tell you to play tight or that this part of the '
 'tournament doesnt matter The deeper stacks at the beginning of events lead '
 'to easy justification for getting involved everywhere We are looking for '
 'reasons to get involved not reasons to sit back and relax Now lets have some '
 'fun I am looking for every reason to get involved in pots during the first '
 'few levels to induce mistakes from my opponents At this stage the tournament '
 'plays closest to a cash game I am limping a lot and raising a lot I am '
 'playing the loose aggressive style that is fun but most importantly '
 'profitable to play During the early levels of tournaments when stacks are '
 'deep there is a very simple concept to understand about your opponents In '
 'general poker players play each street progressively worse Youll hear this a '
 'lot because in my opinion it applies to  of poker players Players make their '
 'best decisions before the flop Preflop decisions are simple because there '
 'are only a finite number of possible situations and there is a wealth of '
 'knowledge available to the general public explaining most of those '
 'situations They know they should fold  from under the gun and  from any '
 'position When the flop comes things get a bit more complicated Continuation '
 'betting has quickly become a universal term that is understood by most '
 'players at its basic level If they raise preflop they know to follow up '
 'their aggression with a strong flop bet Lets assume their continuation bet '
 'got called and the turn brought a card that completes an obvious flush This '
 'situation is now much more complicated than it was a few moments ago on the '
 'flop They are unsure of what their opponent has they dont know whether they '
 'should pot control bet or checkraise After all of that they still have to '
 'deal with the river Do I bet Do I check back my set He may have the flush '
 'There are so many things for someone to consider making the river the most '
 'difficult decision by far in most poker hands The river is where players '
 'tend to make the most mistakes And why not When more information is '
 'presented to a person the more difficult a decision they have They struggle '
 'to decipher all the information gathered on previous streets The average '
 'player makes mistakes on the river by Not value betting enough Not bluffing '
 'enough If both of these things tend to be true then getting to the river '
 'when facing weak opponents should put us in a position to make very '
 'profitable poker decisions When players dont value bet enough andor dont '
 'bluff enough it is very easy to assign our opponent a range By assigning a '
 'range we are able to put our opponent on a very specific set of hands This '
 'allows us to make optimal decisions based on our holdings The fear of '
 'betting I could write a whole book about playing deep stack poker but lets '
 'focus on one major concept that tends to be the biggest mistake that amateur '
 'poker players make and it is mostly due to subconscious fear This is the '
 'fear of betting with the risk of having to fold a made hand if raised We all '
 'know the situation we flopped a set but the turn completed the flush We have '
 'a tight straightforward opponent but choose a',
 'passive pot controlling line for fear of getting raised off our hand '
 'Countless times have I heard a player check back the river with a set or two '
 'pair saying Well I couldnt call a raise The reality in poker is that in my '
 'experience  of players act extremely straightforwardly when cards fall that '
 'drastically change the board texture The fear players have in betfolding '
 'hands incorrectly is just that a subconscious fear that most of the time is '
 'unnecessary The frequency of getting bluffraised especially in situations '
 'with tournament life considerations is so low that checking instead of value '
 'betting is unjustifiably killing your chances to build stacks Let me give '
 'you one more little piece of advice you may not know people dont like '
 'folding Curiosity is as common a trait as you will find at a poker table '
 'People like to sleep well at night They dont care if they are wrong but they '
 'damn well wont lose a pot that they were supposed to win All these points '
 'should lead us to value bet more often while being prepared to fold when '
 'facing aggression from straightforward opponents A recent hand I witnessed '
 'while playing a local tournament demonstrates the mistake players make in '
 'not value betting enough due to the fear of being raised during the early '
 'deep stack stage of tournaments Action folds around to the button who raises '
 'to  with J  at  Both the small blind and big blind call All players are '
 'playing with a  chip starting stack The flop brings A J  The small blind '
 'checks the big blind checks The button bets  and both blinds call The turn '
 'brings A J  Q The small blind checks the big blind checks and the button '
 'checks The river brings A J  Q  The small blind checks the big blind checks '
 'The button bets  and the small blind calls The buttons response when asked '
 'why he didnt bet the turn was If you raise me I would have to fold my hand '
 'So the button has made a fairly standard button steal and both blinds call '
 'After continuation betting the flop he received calls from both of the '
 'blinds It is fairly likely that one of them has an ace He can assume the '
 'small blind has the tighter range of the two players since he was not '
 'closing the action whereas the big blind can call with many more hands '
 'without the fear of being checkraised He can begin to range the small blind '
 'to have a lot of aces flush draws straight draws and some stronger jacks The '
 'big blinds range could contain any number of flush draws gut shots and pairs '
 'hoping to spike a second pair The turn is where I find the major mistake '
 'Dont get me wrong besides the Q this is one of the worst turn cards The '
 'button is now beat by QJ  now has the nut straight and if a player chose to '
 'just call with AQ preflop he is also beat There are a lot of things to be '
 'scared of However there are still many hands he can get value from Any Qx of '
 'hearts combination now has a pair with their flush draw and is certainly not '
 'folding KQ and  have now picked up pairs meaning they will also likely call '
 'a bet Also KJ  and  have now picked up more straight outs There are a few '
 'important ideas to consider that make this a very simple betfold on the turn '
 'for value and some protection even though the button is almost always '
 'folding his hand to a raise in most situations First both of his opponents '
 'have again checked on the turn If that Q improved their hands to beat his '
 'marginal two pair such as with QJ   and AQ I would expect a majority of '
 'players to consider leading into him on the turn a decent percentage of the '
 'time to protect their hand versus the various draws Second by betting the '
 'turn into both opponents he is representing a lot of strength',
 'perhaps even overrepresenting his hand on a scary board such that when he is '
 'raised it is almost always by a hand that crushes him The combination of '
 'both of these factors leads to a very low chance of him being checkraised on '
 'the turn In fact when he checks back the turn instead of betting he will '
 'most likely call a river bet from any of these hands that beat him Therefore '
 'by betting the turn he gets value out of all of the draws and stronger one '
 'pair hands that he beats while extracting enough accurate information to '
 'make a wellinformed fold if raised Start to keep track of this type of '
 'situation Note the hands that opponents are calling with that you beat Note '
 'how often they call this turn Most importantly note how infrequently you '
 'find yourself facing a checkraise and are forced to release a strong but '
 'almost certainly second best hand The more you began to pay attention to the '
 'postflop tendencies of your opponents the more you realize that the majority '
 'of decisions by them are to either call or fold The option to raise is '
 'rarely utilized yet it strikes fear unjustifiably just like the monster in '
 'the closet when you were growing up Look for these situations Tell yourself '
 'before you bet the turn or river that you are betfolding because you will '
 'only get raised by a better hand but will be called by many worse hands The '
 'more you become aware of these situations the more you will realize just how '
 'often they present themselves Developing this tool in your game is one of '
 'the first steps in becoming a force in tournament poker Now that we are more '
 'comfortable playing marginal postflop situations how should we decide which '
 'situations we want to get ourselves into When evaluating many tournament '
 'hands sometimes the mistake is compounded from the beginning A simple '
 'preflop fold or recognition of a rare situation could be the key to a '
 'glorious pot won or the demise of our whole event in just one hand Thats why '
 'tournaments are great Every decision every factor is so important The key '
 'information Lets assume the tournament has progressed a bit and antes have '
 'kicked in The pots are juicy but stack sizes have dwindled a little so we '
 'need to pick our spots very selectively How wide should we be opening How '
 'loose or tight do we play Well it depends As with everything in poker how '
 'our opponents are playing and thinking at the table will help us to '
 'determine our proper battle plan We need to be able to decipher quickly how '
 'loosetightpassiveaggressive our opponents are playing We have a limited '
 'amount of data about each player so we need to develop ways to quickly '
 'assess situations Assessing the opposition One of the biggest pieces of '
 'information we can obtain is how much awareness our opponents possess of '
 'their surroundings Is the player in seat two in the zone taking in '
 'everything that goes on Or is he on his iPad watching a movie One of my '
 'favorite lines that I often hear at a table is He should have known how '
 'tight Ive been playing When in fact you should have known how little '
 'attention your opponent has been giving to the game The next key piece of '
 'information while basic can easily help you categorize certain players Do '
 'they just play their own cards or are they aware of situations and have the '
 'ability to adjust Many players only consider the strength of their own hand '
 'Some players consider two pair to be a premium hand When they make two pair '
 'these players never consider the flush and straight possibilities on the '
 'board because in their mind two pair is supposed to be strong While many '
 'fabulous opportunities are available to check raise on the turn or  preflop '
 'you must quickly find out which players are capable of considering',
 'these plays You find through experience that many are not and thats great We '
 'will be able to make very simple and profitable decisions against these '
 'players Unfortunately we still have to deal with other opponents who are '
 'more aware Lets take a look at the types of preflop considerations we should '
 'be thinking about Your first priority should be to pinpoint where the tough '
 'aggressive players are at your table Are your tough opponents in early '
 'position this hand Is the most skilled player on the button When deciding to '
 'play a hand preflop the people I pay most attention to are the cutoff button '
 'and big blind I want to be aware of who is playing in these seats since they '
 'will be the most likely candidates to call if I raise You should notice that '
 'there are situations in which you should raise  offsuit in early position '
 'when the button is a weak tight player whereas you should fold if the button '
 'is a strong player who doesnt fold the button too often Your ranges for '
 'stealing the blinds should never be set in stone but instead should depend '
 'on all the questions posed above The location of the strong players should '
 'directly affect your preflop ranges That is why it is important to know '
 'which opponents are aware of what is going on at the table Lets take a look '
 'at an example of a great spot to open with a wide range I start each hand by '
 'assessing the players in the big blind and on the button How tight or loose '
 'do they play Are they the type of player who will defend the blind liberally '
 'and rarely fold to aggression from the button Or are they supertight and '
 'will only play back with premium hands How well do they play postflop This '
 'information is vitally important because you will play most of your hands '
 'against these two players The button will have incentive due to being in '
 'position in the hand while the big blind will be receiving the best odds to '
 'call because of the chips already committed These simple yet often forgotten '
 'questions will help you develop your guidelines for starting hand selection '
 'We are in the lojack seat the seat three to the right of the button with  '
 'The hijack just sat down and this is his first hand being dealt in The '
 'cutoff just lost two pots in a row when his steals failed The button just '
 'won two pots from the cutoff by making good calls The small blind plays a '
 'lot of hands in a bad manner after the flop The big blind is super tight '
 'Everyone folds around to us in the lojack We raise to  at  and everyone '
 'folds giving us the blinds and antes This situation is ideal for a light '
 'steal The hijack is unlikely to fight since he is brand new and likely wants '
 'to get a feel for the table Both the cutoff and button would normally be an '
 'issue but since they have played two sizable pots in back to back hands they '
 'will likely play more conservatively for a few hands If the small blind who '
 'plays a lot of hands were to play that is fine because we have position on '
 'him Finally the big blind is a very tight player who is folding way too much '
 'The same situation came up later in the event at  and I raised   and also '
 'stole the blinds successfully in the same position An important fact that is '
 'misconstrued by many poker observers is that players change their strategies '
 'not only from session to session but from minute to minute based on various '
 'factors At the completion of every orbit I do what I call a mental checkup '
 'on every opponent at the table I do this when I am in first position after I '
 'fold How tight or loose is each opponent playing Are they winning or losing '
 'Did they just lose a big pot resulting in tilt that may cause them to '
 'implode Are they in the zone Are they easily distracted and not taking in '
 'information All these quick easy questions give me a rough guide of how I '
 'will exploit each opponent Keeping up',
 'distracted and not taking in information All these quick easy questions give '
 'me a rough guide of how I will exploit each opponent Keeping up to date on '
 'these factors is important due to the everchanging dynamics of tournaments '
 'It is also important to note opponents stack sizes when doing this checkup '
 'It should take no more than a minute or two to go around the table assessing '
 'each player',
 'While I will always use all information available to me such as a hand I '
 'played two months ago versus a particular opponent I always give the highest '
 'value to the most recent information I am always amazed by how one bad play '
 'will stick with people forever If someone makes a poor call down it is a '
 'common mistake to label that person as a calling station Most people will '
 'keep that read for months and fail to realize that a player has made an '
 'adjustment in their game and is now exploiting you because you failed to '
 'recognize that change The simple yet extremely important situations '
 'presented above illustrate the key to developing correct preflop strategies '
 'in tournaments The nature of short stack play late in a tournament leads to '
 'most pots ending without ever seeing a flop The players who take in the most '
 'information about players in various situations and adjust accordingly will '
 'begin to accumulate the most chips with very little confrontation Having the '
 'ability to accurately pinpoint ideal blind stealing situations is the most '
 'efficient way to build a chip stack with minimal risk Taking it to the next '
 'level you can focus on identifying players who like to raise with a wide '
 'range in these spots and fight back by reraising or flat calling in position '
 'to create profitable situations for yourself After observing the changing '
 'dynamics of player behavior as the button moves around the table we are now '
 'armed with the ability to combat players in good situations Suppose a solid '
 'player in middle position raises preflop We have an idea that he may be '
 'raising with a wide range because the button is tight and the big blind is '
 'an overly weak player with whom everyone wants to get involved We are in the '
 'cutoff with a marginal KJ offsuit Whats the best way to proceed with our '
 'newfound information To  or not to  There is a new trend developing in poker '
 'where people are  all of their playable hands when facing a preflop raise '
 'You may be wondering why they choose to  KJ in the above situation Many '
 'players will not be able to give you a reason They justify their action by '
 'saying Its a tournament I have to play aggressively Calling is bad I have to '
 'take the lead This all goes back to the leading question of this chapter You '
 'have to figure out why you are making a particular play You must have solid '
 'reasoning for every action you take in poker and just being aggressive is '
 'not enough in todays game Lets begin by looking at the reasons why we might '
 'choose to  with KJ in this situation First it is entirely possible that the '
 'original raiser has shown us that one of his mistakes is folding too often '
 'to  bets This could lead to an immediately profitable and low variance way '
 'to take down the pot which is great for us Lets look at a little math to '
 'help explain this The blinds are  The pot is  before any action preflop The '
 'middle position player raises to  The pot is now  We  with KJ to  Everyone '
 'folds to the middle position raiser What percentage of the time must he '
 'choose any option other than fold for us to immediately profit We are '
 'risking  to win  We can use simple math to figure out what percentage of the '
 'time our opponent must fold for immediate profit By taking   amount and '
 'dividing by  our  plus the pot   we come up with a breakeven mark for our '
 'raise If the opponent folds more than   of the time we have an immediately '
 'profitable  This is of course a basic example to explain the math but if his '
 'only two options were to fold or go allin our raise only has to work  of the '
 'time to show a profit If he folds  of the time we should  every single time '
 'he opens Fortunately poker isnt that cut and dry Your opponent has more '
 'options than to go allin or fold He',
 'can call or raise to an amount smaller than allin You may decide that it '
 'makes sense to  this player because you expect him to play well after the '
 'flop if you call You feel that he may be able to outplay you after the flop '
 'putting you in difficult situations A  preflop with KJ gives you a great '
 'chance to win the pot immediately while allowing you not to worry about '
 'difficult spots later Many times a smart tough opponent will fold to your '
 'preflop reraise because he will be out of position assuming he respects your '
 'game Using this reasoning  will help lower your variance by winning small '
 'pots preflop as well as allowing you to stay out of difficult postflop spots '
 'assuming you believe you have the respect of this specific opponent The '
 'final reason you may choose to  preflop is because you have developed an '
 'aggressive dynamic with this specific opponent Perhaps enough action has '
 'occurred such that you can profitably get it allin before the flop Lets turn '
 'that KJ into A Q and lets assume that both you and the middle position '
 'player have been involved in many pots Most of these pots have involved a '
 'lot of preflop aggression He has seen you  multiple players without having '
 'to show down a hand and you have noticed that he seems frustrated With  in '
 'chips to start the hand he raises to  at  and you  to  You are  betting with '
 'the full intention of calling his shove for  Due to your aggressive dynamic '
 'you feel there is a great chance that he will reraise or go allin with a '
 'hand like AJ or KQ to try to end the pot right there The important thing to '
 'note is that you have developed a significant dynamic with this opponent Too '
 'many times players will  and call the shove with a hand like  or  because it '
 'was a good spot but without this additional knowledge they fail to realize '
 'the lack of an aggressive dynamic Simply because someone is reasonably '
 'aggressive does not mean they are going to put their entire stack in the pot '
 'before the flop with a hand such as  or  if they havent  in five hours When '
 'they find themselves allin with a reasonably strong but dominated hand they '
 'immediately chalk it up to a cooler and fail to realize that their '
 'opponents  range in that spot only included better hands than  meaning  '
 'should be an easy fold These  spots are one of the reasons that tournaments '
 'are so interesting You may have heard of the term Leveling War This is when '
 'players develop such an aggressive dynamic that they start to believe that '
 'their opponents are going to   and  with almost anything While these spots '
 'are fun and intriguing they are rarely necessary and often lead to '
 'significantly higher variance Calling versus  Of course there are options '
 'besides  Lets discuss the reasons why we may choose to call with KJ in the '
 'previous situation First we have position Yes position is still important in '
 'poker Perhaps we dont want to end the hand before the flop because we are '
 'very confident in our postflop skill Perhaps the raiser from middle position '
 'is a very weak postflop player Maybe the player lacks aggression postflop '
 'and makes a lot of major errors These reasons can all be used to justify '
 'calling Another trend that I have noticed recently that leads to calling '
 'instead of reraising is the sizing of my opponents postflop bets You may '
 'have noticed a large percentage of players now make continuation bets that '
 'are less than the size of their preflop opening raise Suppose you are in the '
 'same situation as before facing a middle position raise to  This time you '
 'just call with KJ from the cutoff The flop comes    The middle position '
 'player bets  into the pot of  You are now getting  or  to see the turn',
 'This time you just call with KJ from the cutoff The flop comes    The middle '
 'position player bets  into the pot of  You are now getting  or  to see the '
 'turn You should almost never fold when facing this flop bet size Your K and '
 'J are likely clean outs plus a nonheart queen gives you the nuts Perhaps you '
 'may be able to steal the pot if a heart comes on the turn',
 'or the river In general you should be more prone to call with KJ preflop if '
 'you know this opponent will choose a small continuation bet size on the flop '
 'compared to betting closer to the size of the pot Your opponents small bet '
 'size will make it much easier for you to see cheap turns and rivers in '
 'position allowing you to improve occasionally to the best hand while also '
 'giving you the opportunity to steal the pot when it becomes clear that your '
 'opponent doesnt like his holding Our decision to  or call before the flop '
 'also depends on the players yet to act As discussed previously we need to be '
 'hyperaware of the players behind us and have an idea of how they will react '
 'in certain situations With tough aggressive players left to act who may '
 'frequently squeeze or call behind forcing us to play out of position we may '
 'choose to  or fold our KJ Or perhaps the players yet to act are overly weak '
 'and we want to keep them in the pot In the above example the player in the '
 'big blind was a very weak player Since we want him to stay in the pot we '
 'should call because if we  he will frequently fold which is the exact '
 'opposite of what we want It would be a disaster to have the weak player fold '
 'a hand containing a K because we would surely get multiple bets out of him '
 'if we both flopped top pair Imagine that instead of KJ we have a premium '
 'hand such as AA or KK We can choose to call if there are aggressive '
 'squeezers behind us as well as short stacked players who can shove allin '
 'Flatting with a premium hand in these situations especially when short '
 'stacked can trap overly aggressive opponents and short stacks All these '
 'small pieces of information must be considered in what might otherwise be '
 'straightforward scenarios In general the softer the table we are playing at '
 'the more apt we should be to call rather than  in most situations By  at '
 'soft tables we are bloating pots decreasing the stacktopot ratio and making '
 'it harder for our opponents to make costly mistakes on the turn and river '
 'Now that we have a decent understanding of reasons to  versus simply calling '
 'lets talk about the concept of leveraging Leveraging Leveraging is one of '
 'the most important tools you can utilize in a tournament In its most basic '
 'form leveraging involves risking a small percentage of your stack while at '
 'the same time putting a large percent of your opponents stack at risk A '
 'classic example of leveraging occurs in short stack play If you and your '
 'opponent both have  and you know that when facing a raise your opponent will '
 'go allin with his strong hands and fold his junky hands you can raise to  '
 'and figure out roughly what your opponent has without risking many chips By '
 'putting in  you have induced your opponent to either fold or risk his '
 'entire  stack In this example you have risked only  of your stack but you '
 'have put your opponents entire stack at risk When used correctly leveraging '
 'is an extremely powerful tool You are able to put a large percentage of your '
 'opponents chips at risk with little risk to your own Lets continue by '
 'looking at different forms of leveraging and how to add them to your arsenal '
 'The most common form of leveraging deep in tournaments will come from '
 'preflop  with shallow stacks These situations are frequently available deep '
 'in tournaments and often the best players and the most difficult to play '
 'against are the ones who identify and take advantage of them In preflop '
 'leveraging spots your cards are frequently irrelevant Your opponents range '
 'and the percentage of the time you think they will fold their hand to '
 'aggression become the most important factors  leveraging',
 'Lets assume you have a solid opponent who has been playing a tight '
 'straightforward game for the last few orbits and he raises from the cutoff '
 'to  out of his  stack at  You are on the button Preflop there are  chips '
 'from the blinds and antes we will assume  play for easier math plus your '
 'opponents  raise for a total of  Regardless of our holding if we now  to  '
 'our raise will only have to work  of the time this is  to show a profit Now '
 'lets make a few common assumptions about the type of opponent against whom '
 'we want to try this with weak hands such as  Firstly they need to be '
 'positionally aware meaning they are conscious of situations where they '
 'should not be calling out of position when short stacked versus a  Our goal '
 'is to put our opponent in an all in or fold situation thus making our cards '
 'irrelevant Secondly our opponent is raising with too many hands and is not '
 'adjusting his range based on how many chips he has Many players fail to '
 'adjust their raising range as the stacks get short They become extremely '
 'vulnerable to leveraging spots such as the one above If we pick ideal '
 'situations where the above assumptions are true it is very difficult for our '
 'opponent to play back at us go allin more than  of the time If he is shoving '
 'more than this he is likely opening way tighter than we think he has more '
 'value hands or he is recognizing our situation and thus going all in wider '
 'for value or as a bluff This should lead us to increase our range for '
 'calling his allin Lets take a look at an example of a loose aggressive '
 'opponent raising from the cutoff position to see how this math works In this '
 'example lets assume the cutoff will open  of hands  of all hands includes '
 'all pairs suited aces            This is a good base point for loose players '
 'some will open more some less For our  to work in the above scenario the '
 'player must shove less than  of the time By multiplying  by  we find that '
 'our opponent must shove  of hands to break even  of all poker hands '
 'includes        QJo The point of this example is to realize how much of the '
 'opening range the opponent must shove Take a look at those hands Our '
 'opponent needs to shove hands as weak as   and  in order for us not to '
 'exploit the original raise Many opponents will not take on the variance '
 'involved with shoving weak hands such as  and  It is important that you get '
 'comfortable with tools like Pokerstove a program to calculate ranges that I '
 'used to find the above hands in order to learn how to evaluate ranges The '
 'type of players you do not want to perform this move against would be '
 'players who often flat call  Against this type of player our hand matters '
 'much more We need a hand that has at least some potential to connect with '
 'the flop such as a big suited connectors or Broadway hands When you can '
 'identify the correct players against whom to execute leveraging  you will '
 'have a powerful tool for taking down bloated pots preflop with little '
 'confrontation or risk Leveraging and betsizing A major part of leveraging in '
 'tournaments is learning to use the correct betsizing Betsizing is perhaps '
 'the least thought about aspect of poker but it can often be the most '
 'important decision in a hand Many players fail to recognize how many options '
 'they have with betsizing These options are particularly important when stack '
 'sizes become shallower near the end of tournaments Like everything else we '
 'have discussed so far you should always be asking why you are choosing a '
 'particular sizing What are you trying to accomplish with this sizing What '
 'are the reasons for using a small sizing versus a larger sizing',
 'trying to accomplish with this sizing What are the reasons for using a small '
 'sizing versus a larger sizing Deep in tournaments I find that the turn '
 'produces the most interesting spots with regard to betsizing By choosing the '
 'right turn sizing you can better set up your options for the river or take '
 'away tools from your opponent The turn is also the street where postflop '
 'leveraging becomes most relevant due to the increased pot size If you pay '
 'close attention to this you will find that the turn offers many spots where',
 'you can leverage your opponent into an allin or fold scenario When performed '
 'correctly you can put a high percentage of your opponents stack at risk '
 'while risking relatively few of your own chips Here is an example You hold K '
 'Q in the cutoff and raise to  at  The big blind a generic loose passive '
 'player with  chips calls  more The flop comes    The pot is  and the big '
 'blind checks You bet  and your opponent calls We can begin to range our '
 'opponent on the flop He can have any pair perhaps with a hand such as  or  '
 'although we should discount top pair a decent amount of the time since many '
 'players with a short stack would try to protect top pair with a raise in '
 'this situation He can also have many combinations of straight draws such as '
 'with  or  The turn brings    A The pot is  and the big blind has  left in '
 'his stack You should realize that it is very difficult for the opponent to '
 'have an ace since he did not  preflop and he would have to have checkcalled '
 'the flop with ace high out of position which isnt a play most players would '
 'consider This means that if he does have an ace it is likely either   or  '
 'giving him two pair When choosing to bet this turn our sizing is extremely '
 'important for accomplishing our goals Instead of moving allin for a near '
 'potsized bet a sizing of between  and  can accomplish the same result while '
 'risking fewer chips By betting smaller we are still risking a large enough '
 'portion of our opponents stack such that most players will feel that they '
 'need to move allin or fold If we happened to turn top pair this spot instead '
 'of having KQ we should still choose a sizing of around  The fear of an '
 'upcoming allin river bet is often enough to discourage calls and force your '
 'opponent to risk all their chips or fold while we only have to risk around  '
 'of our stack It is important to be able to figure out if your opponent is '
 'the type of player who is capable of folding on the river after calling flop '
 'and turn bets or if they will never fold on the river in this situation '
 'Identifying which players will and wont fold in high pressure river '
 'situations is mandatory for leveraging your turn bets Against opponents who '
 'frequently call the flop call the turn and then fold the river you can use a '
 'turn sizing that sets up a perfect river shove to get a great price on '
 'stealing the pot Against players who like to fold or move allin on the turn '
 'choose a sizing that forces them to make a decision for all of their chips '
 'By betting  their stack regardless of the pot size you give yourself a great '
 'price on stealing the pot Be sure to use the same sizing with your hands '
 'that will call the shove so you dont become easy to read Being able to '
 'choose the correct betsizing in order to leverage your opponents chip stack '
 'is one of the most crucial aspects of tournaments This is unlike cash games '
 'where players can buy in for a huge number of big blinds and never face an '
 'allin situation In any given tournament hand you can make your opponent risk '
 'his entire tournament life Whether it is by shoving allin preflop or betting '
 'half of an opponents stack it is often the stack size of the opponent and '
 'not the size of the pot that should dictate how much we bet This is an '
 'additional part of my assessment of the table each orbit Make sure that you '
 'have a good idea of your opponents chip stacks before you enter a pot '
 'Tournament stages',
 'M and the impact of antes One of the biggest differences you will find in '
 'tournaments versus playing live cash games is the addition of antes While '
 'most players are aware of what the standard ante is at most levels in a '
 'tournament many fail to recognize how they should adjust their strategy as '
 'the ante size changes Most tend to judge the size of the ante relative to '
 'the size of the small blind Thus at  with a  ante we have a  ante but at  '
 'with a  ante we have a  ante For our purposes a  ante or smaller some are  '
 'will be considered small and  antes and larger will be considered large We '
 'can use Dan Harringtons concept of M to figure out how antes are affecting '
 'players stacks Lets say we have  chips at  We can easily calculate that we '
 'have  by dividing  by  but due to the presence of antes our stack is '
 'actually much shorter than it may appear Each round of ten hands will cost '
 'us  from both blinds as well as  from ten antes You can add those numbers to '
 'figure out that each orbit of ten hands costs  chips By dividing  by  we can '
 'figure out that we have an M of roughly eight This means we will blind out '
 'in around  hands eight orbits of ten hands if we were to walk away from the '
 'table There are many valuable ways to use M to help you make decisions '
 'especially when playing a short stack Personally I use both the number of '
 'big blinds I have as well as M to assess tournament situations Lets say you '
 'have an M of eight in the above example and someone raises to  preflop Now '
 'there is an M of two in the pot If you were to shove allin and your opponent '
 'folds you would add  to your stack This is massive When you can add  to your '
 'stack with a successful steal going allin is almost certainly better than '
 'calling and seeing a flop It may be hard to grasp but there are situations '
 'where moving allin is actually the lowest variance play due to your fold '
 'equity When you are in the blinds with an M between six and eight and have '
 'an aggressive cutoff or button who raises most pots when folded to there are '
 'strong arguments you can make for shoving without looking at your cards This '
 'is because when he folds you add anywhere from  to  to your stack If you do '
 'this three times you double up When you can find players who raise preflop a '
 'lot but lack the ability to call an allin with marginal hands instantly '
 'profitable allin spots are presented to you A player who is opening too many '
 'hands from the cutoff or button will not have a strong hand often enough to '
 'call your allin thus making this play very profitable especially if you have '
 'a tight image giving you even more fold equity While the size of the antes '
 'will affect your M it should also affect many of your preflop decisions When '
 'the antes are big you should be more prone to try to steal the blinds before '
 'the flop With small antes you should be a bit tighter A common level where '
 'tournaments differentiate the ante is at the  level You will find that there '
 'is either a  or  ante Lets assume you have an average  stack of  The M in '
 'the  example would be   versus the  ante M of   As you can see when the '
 'antes are large stealing the pot before the flop yields  more chips Those  '
 'extra chips in every pot should lead you to open up your preflop range as '
 'you get a much better price for stealing the blinds If you were to raise to  '
 'in both situations in the small ante example your raise must work   of the '
 'time to show a profit versus  of the time with the big ante Thus I tend to '
 'favor an aggressive strategy in large ante levels For example in a marginal '
 'spot where I can justify both folding and raising I may fold in a small ante',
 'with the big ante Thus I tend to favor an aggressive strategy in large ante '
 'levels For example in a marginal spot where I can justify both folding and '
 'raising I may fold in a small ante level but raise in a large ante level The '
 'large antes should also affect how you play from the blinds Due to more dead '
 'money in every pot with large antes defending your big blinds becomes more '
 'viable due to the increased pot odds This is especially true against '
 'habitual minraisers where you can get as much as  or  odds to defend your '
 'big blind When more experienced you will find more spots to steal pots '
 'postflop as well as more opportunities to extract value from marginal hands '
 'As you become more comfortable playing postflop you can start defending '
 'marginal hands such as K  against small preflop',
 'raises to take advantages of your postflop skills Antes are an integral part '
 'of tournament poker that are not often seen in cash games The best players '
 'in the world are the most efficient battlers for preflop pots in tournaments '
 'They effectively pick and choose their spots to win uncontested pots that '
 'are bloated because of antes By properly adjusting to antes you will give '
 'yourself the best opportunity to recognize every situation that you can get '
 'involved in late in tournaments where preflop play matters most Tournament '
 'life The fact that you cannot buy more chips for your stack as you can in a '
 'cash game makes tournaments a challenging and sophisticated form of poker '
 'The inability to top off your stack or to reload in order to get money back '
 'from the player who just stacked you creates neverending discussions about '
 'how to approach the concept of tournament life The ability to navigate your '
 'way through a tournament and manage your stack size falls into this '
 'discussion The question of when should I take a coin flip or the idea of I '
 'didnt want to risk my stack can create different answers to questions from '
 'equally skilled players While some very skilled players will argue that you '
 'should take every single situation that is profitable others will pass up '
 'marginal situations that create very little equity hoping that by preserving '
 'their stack they can later capitalize on more profitable spots I like to '
 'equate the question of tournament life to basic principles I learned when '
 'studying finance In finance the term beta is used to describe a particular '
 'stock or portfolios volatility when compared to the market For example a '
 'stock with a beta of  would increase in value by  when the market increases  '
 'With a beta of  if the market increased by  this particularly riskier stock '
 'would increase by  thus providing more return than the market The opposite '
 'also holds true when the market falls by  this  beta stock would decrease '
 'by  Stocks with less than  beta are less volatile then the market A  beta '
 'stock would only yield a return of  for a  market increase but would also '
 'only fall  when the market falls There are even negative beta stocks that '
 'would increase in value when the market falls but also decrease when the '
 'market rises Any type of insurance is a great example of a negative beta '
 'investment The key point to understand is that more risk offers more return '
 'but also more volatility In finance investors create portfolios of stocks to '
 'help eliminate the risk of beta by having some low beta stocks high beta '
 'stocks and even negative beta stocks They ideally create portfolios that are '
 'immune to the ups and downs of the market while also still maximizing their '
 'return on investment We can easily relate these terms back to tournament '
 'poker Lets start with beta This is much like playing tight versus playing '
 'loose A tight player is just like a low beta stock meaning they have less '
 'volatility in their stack but also may have less return on investment due to '
 'relatively little risk A loose aggressive player is like a high beta stock '
 'They take on more volatility in order to increase returns How does the '
 'standard market in finance relate to poker I consider the market to be the '
 'standard variance that every player is subjected to in poker For example a  '
 'coin flip would be an example of the standard stock market variation Tying '
 'it all back in a tight low beta player would be subjected to fewer coin '
 'flips or stack volatility spots than a high beta loose aggressive player '
 'Thus while one player has lower variance and lower return the other '
 'possesses higher variance with higher return Just like in the stock market '
 'neither low nor high beta stocks are bad but both forms of stocks should be '
 'combined in order to create optimal portfolios of stocks Our portfolio of '
 'stocks in poker are all the tools ',
 'order to create optimal portfolios of stocks Our portfolio of stocks in '
 'poker are all the tools  flat calling folding raising playing aggressively '
 'etc that we possess in order to help make the most profitable situations '
 'Thus we should not play only a high or low beta strategy but instead combine '
 'the two situations to create a better overall game Lets look at some more '
 'specific situations that occur throughout tournaments to tie all of this '
 'volatility',
 'talk together When I am short stacked in a tournament  to  I want to '
 'increase my variance thus increasing my return as much as possible With this '
 'stack I will not pass up any spot that I deem to be profitable Much of this '
 'revolves around the math related to short stack allin spots When I am a '
 'bigger stack in a tournament with  or more or perhaps two times the average '
 'stack its all relative I want to reduce my variance in the tournament This '
 'will lead me to pass up on some high variance spots that I deem to be '
 'profitable The reason behind the variability of variance that I take on '
 'voluntarily has to do with the tools available to me with any given stack '
 'size or situation For example with a short stack of  to  I cannot play '
 'postflop I have no fold equity preflop and I am only able to go allin or '
 'fold Being short stacked is like being in handcuffs By increasing my '
 'variance and taking all profitable spots I maximize my chance of regaining '
 'certain tools which in turn can create more profitable situations in the '
 'future When I have a big stack of  I feel that all of my tools are available '
 'to me I am able to  in good situations and still fold with plenty of chips '
 'if it doesnt work out I am also able to call with speculative hands from '
 'late position when weak players raise in front of me As you can see I have '
 'many more opportunities to get into profitable situations This means I can '
 'show patience by picking and choosing the most profitable spots Lets look at '
 'an example of a situation that I may pass up on in a tournament by taking a '
 'lower variance approach We have a  stack of  while the average stack is  at  '
 'We raise to  with  in middle position The action folds to the big blind who '
 'moves allin for  We can turn this into an extreme example by saying that the '
 'big blind accidentally turned over his AK We feel the general field in this '
 'tournament is very soft and we possess a big edge Considering all of this '
 'information do we feel that we should make the call The math in this spot '
 'dictates that this is a profitable call to make with  There are  chips in '
 'the pot  our raise  the small blind  the antes  the amount for which our '
 'opponent went allin and we have to call  more By dividing  by   we find out '
 'that we need  equity to call and our hand  is a  favorite versus AK The math '
 'says that we should make this call but the math should not have the final '
 'verdict Unlike in a cash game we are not able to reload chips if we lose '
 'this flip In tournament play you must evaluate different outcomes to assess '
 'the riskreward situation Lets look at both possible outcomes First we win '
 'the coin flip and now we have a stack of  How has our position changed by '
 'going from  to  We have a little more wiggle room in our stack and likely '
 'would be one of the chip leaders having over two times the average stack '
 'However looking at our position with  we are able to do most of the things '
 'we want to do in a soft tournament compared with when we have  We can still  '
 'and fold see many flops and in general take advantage of profitable '
 'situations as we see fit Now lets look at the downside risk If we call and '
 'lose this flip we have gone from  to  With  some of our options have been '
 'removed We will have to be very cautious with our choices preflop as our '
 'shorter stack may put us in many more marginal situations We have to be very '
 'selective and sure about our  preflop as they will cost us a large '
 'percentage of our stack These situations in this case a  coin flip come up '
 'very often in tournaments The weighing of pros and cons of each individual '
 'situation is vital in helping you come to the correct conclusion Perhaps',
 'pros and cons of each individual situation is vital in helping you come to '
 'the correct conclusion Perhaps this is the softest tournament in the history '
 'of poker If so then you should certainly pass up on this positive '
 'expectation spot If this is the toughest tournament ever you should for sure '
 'take advantage of it by calling Given the above information about how soft '
 'the tournament in the example is I would most likely pass on this profitable '
 'situation I would most likely feel with my current stack size that I will '
 'find more profitable spots and increase my stack using a lower variance '
 'strategy The small amount of',
 'expectation I would gain by calling the allin with  is not worth the risk of '
 'losing my tools There is no single strategy that is optimal for tournament '
 'poker A combination of different strategies must be used to navigate events '
 'with a large number of players The ability to change gears and adjust is one '
 'of the most valuable attributes you will find among the best players in the '
 'room Knowing when to change gears and how to preserve your stack in certain '
 'spots while also knowing when to attack to obtain a stack helps create a '
 'more complete tournament strategy Moving to the next level When players are '
 'trying to take their tournament game to the next level they must learn to '
 'evaluate situations more effectively There is a great deal of information on '
 'the internet covering basic strategy but learning to understand why you '
 'should be doing those things is far more valuable than studying information '
 'available online Give a man a fish and he eats for a day teach a man to fish '
 'and he eats for life Through this chapter I have hopefully taught you how to '
 'fish The most interesting situations in tournaments are the ones in which '
 'many successful tournament players disagree on the correct course of action '
 'The fact that no two spots are ever the same in a tournament leads to '
 'interesting debates among players After six years of tournament experience I '
 'am still baffled by certain situations as a result of all the variable '

 ' SUCCESS IN SATELLITES QUALIFY FOR YOUR DREAM TOURNAMENT Introduction Most '
 'poker players dream of playing in the World Series of Pokers WSOPs Main '
 'Event This tournament which I often refer to on cable channel ESPN as the '
 'Mac Daddy of poker has been the aspiration of millions since the increased '
 'television coverage in the  Players dream about capturing the fame the '
 'fortune and the most coveted bracelet in poker However most players cannot '
 'plunk down  for a single tournament This extravagant amount is simply beyond '
 'their bankroll and means Nevertheless for the past decade the WSOP Main '
 'Event has never had fewer than  registrants Prior to  there had never been '
 'more than  players How could the registration numbers explode in a matter of '
 'a couple of years One single event in history changed the game and it was '
 'the direct result of the introduction of satellite tournaments The '
 'accountant from Tennessee who won the  WSOP Main Event qualified for the '
 'tournament via a  satellite Ultimately Chris Moneymaker converted this small '
 'buyin amount into  million for first place setting off a poker boom '
 'affectionately known as the Moneymaker Effect Since then players have '
 'utilized the satellite system to gain entry into not only the WSOP Main '
 'Event but other larger buyin events around the globe During my travels '
 'around the world over the past decade I have played in countless satellites '
 'It never ceases to amaze me how poorly players play satellites Many players '
 'play them identically to a customary multitable tournament MTT Others play '
 'so tight trying to sneak into the money the Main Event places that they '
 'blind themselves right out of the satellite Some gather an enormous chip '
 'lead and try to win all the chips only to convert their huge stack into '
 'massive disappointment Each of these strategies is incorrect leading myriad '
 'players to fall short of their ultimate goal In this chapter I will help you '
 'recognize the difference between a multitable satellite and a standard MTT '
 'while explaining the best method of qualifying for an event via a satellite '
 'By utilizing the concepts and techniques in this chapter you will give '
 'yourself the best opportunity to qualify for the event of your dreams maybe '
 'even the WSOP Main Event History Before I begin discussing the concepts and '
 'strategy required to win at satellites let us first look at the history of '
 'the satellite',
 'The poker boom resulted from a combination of several factors including the '
 'expansion of online poker nonsmoking poker rooms and hole card cameras '
 'creating expanded television coverage of poker At the center of this poker '
 'explosion was the improbable run of the  WSOP Main Event champion Chris '
 'Moneymaker who qualified for the event via a  satellite online However the '
 'accountant from Tennessee did not invent the satellite and neither did '
 'Pokerstarscom which is the online site where he won his WSOP Main Event seat '
 'The satellite concept was created in the late  by former card room manager '
 'Eric Drache Having worked at the Golden Nugget and Mirage Drache was also '
 'the WSOP tournament director from  through  In those days the WSOP was still '
 'in its infancy During its first ten years the average field for the WSOP '
 'Main Event was only  players with its largest field of  in  Thus adding just '
 'one more player would be a significant percentage increase to the field '
 'During Draches tenure the goal of Binions Horseshoe was to always have at '
 'least one more player in the WSOP Main Event compared to the previous year '
 'This target would ultimately show the poker world a growing trend in the '
 'event and poker in general Consequently Drache designed a revolutionary way '
 'to get more players registered for the  buyin event thus the  single table '
 'satellite was born For his contribution to the world of poker which included '
 'the invention of the satellite Drache was elected to the Poker Hall of Fame '
 'in  Initially Drache thought the concept was only for players who couldnt '
 'afford the  buyin which would make winning the seat a huge deal However '
 'after time some players would play satellites to not only win a seat but to '
 'win multiple seats and make additional money Over time the satellite became '
 'very common Other casinos supported the WSOP by providing satellite winners '
 'to the Main Event Although more players were added to the field every year '
 'the true moment of success and popularity for the satellite came in  That '
 'year Tom McEvoy outlasted a field of  registrants and was crowned the  WSOP '
 'Main Event champion This victory changed the poker landscape forever as '
 'McEvoy became the first player ever to win the WSOP Main Event after earning '
 'his seat via a satellite Ironically the runnerup that year Rod Peate also '
 'won his seat via a satellite with both of these players outlasting the  and  '
 'champion Doyle Brunson who finished in  place The WSOP publicized this '
 'significant achievement attracting more and more players throughout the  By '
 'the end of the decade the registration for the Main Event almost doubled and '
 'by  the enrollment was over  players However in  a young man from Tennessee '
 'created an unrivaled explosion in poker that changed the WSOP Main Event '
 'forever Chris Moneymaker accidentally registered online for a  satellite '
 'ironically believing it was a cash tournament Upon winning this initial '
 'satellite he earned a seat into another multitable satellite this time for a '
 'seat into the WSOP Main Event He won his Main Event seat a few days later '
 'and the rest is history With Moneymakers improbable victory coinciding with '
 'the start of the hole card cameras and expanded ESPN coverage Norman Chad '
 'eventually uttered that iconic phrase This is beyond fairytale This is '
 'inconceivable After that fateful year the number of registrants for the WSOP '
 'Main Event began to increase exponentially tripling the following year and '
 'increasing tenfold in just three years Today thousands of players qualify '
 'via satellites The field size of the Main Event would never be as large '
 'without them Additionally dozens of tournaments across the globe employ a '
 'satellite system to increase their field sizes Number one goal survival',
 'In a poker tournament the objective is to be the last player standing '
 'Ultimately the player with all the chips at the end of the tournament '
 'captures the title and earns the most money The players who come in second '
 'or third or who sneak into the money earn less than the eventual winner '
 'depending on their place However satellites are a different animal as all '
 'players who qualify receive the identical prize a seat in the next event '
 'Whether the player is the chip leader or the one with the least amount of '
 'chips even if he or she has only one chip left they all earn a seat in the '
 'qualifying tournament Thus the number one goal in a satellite is SURVIVAL '
 'Many players do not realize this priority for satellites Instead they employ '
 'a typical MTT strategy Even with an above average stack with a few '
 'eliminations left before everyone gets in the money they continue to take '
 'unnecessary risks to win Risking their stack especially late in a satellite '
 'is foolish and sometimes leads to their demise Before I discuss the specific '
 'strategies for a satellite let us discuss some important terms that I will '
 'use throughout this chapter Important terms Fold equity Using Wikipedia the '
 'definition of this poker term is summarized as follows Fold equity is a '
 'concept in poker strategy that is especially important when a player becomes '
 'shortstacked in a nolimit or possibly potlimit tournament Fold equity '
 'becomes an important concept for short stacks for the following reason '
 'Opponents can be considered likely to call allins with a certain range of '
 'hands When they will have to use a large percentage of their stack to make '
 'the call this range can be expected to be quite narrow it will include all '
 'the hands the caller expects to win an allin against the bettor As the '
 'percentage of stack needed to call becomes lower the range of cards the '
 'caller will need becomes wider and he or she becomes less likely to fold '
 'Consequently fold equity diminishes There will be a point at which a caller '
 'will need a sufficiently small percentage of their stack to call the allin '
 'that they will do so with any two cards At that point the allin bettor will '
 'have no fold equity Therefore the important takeaway for satellite strategy '
 'especially for the short stacks is that a player must maintain fold equity '
 'Throughout the satellite especially the later levels moments arise where you '
 'must push allin with any two cards in order to survive Although this may '
 'seem counterintuitive to the survival mantra remember that your opponents '
 'want to survive as well Thus they will not call you unless they have a huge '
 'hand a situation which occurs infrequently Poker fact There are  different '
 'hands combinations eg AA to  Based on your estimation how many different '
 'hands will an opponent call with when a satellite seat is on the line I '
 'would definitely say less than  and I believe it may even be less than  of '
 'all possible hands Therefore as long as you have fold equity you have an '
 'excellent chance of surviving the hand However your fold equity decreases as '
 'your stack gets smaller Thus you cannot wait until your stack is too small '
 'To determine how small is too small you must understand the average stack '
 'size especially in a satellite Average stack for a satellite For most MTTs '
 'that have a good blind structure and provide an ample starting stack the '
 'average stack size is commonly  For the WSOP Main Event with its '
 'unparalleled twohour blind levels the average stack is often  However due to '
 'the nature of satellites and their survival mode tactics the',
 'average stack near the end of the event is usually only about  Therefore due '
 'to the lower average stack in satellites you can patiently wait until you '
 'are down to  or  before shoving with any two cards since you will often '
 'still have fold equity the exception would be if a couple of huge stacks are '
 'sitting behind you I have even witnessed a player inducing folds from '
 'opponents with as little as  However I would not recommend blinding yourself '
 'down to this stack size as many players will call a raise that small without '
 'even looking at their cards Effective stack size After the initial hand of a '
 'tournament or satellite all players will have differing stack sizes As the '
 'tournament progresses the chip leaders have a distinct advantage The more '
 'chips you possess the less of a chance that you can be eliminated from a '
 'tournament or satellite In fact having the biggest stack at the table means '
 'that you cannot be eliminated from the tournament or satellite in one hand '
 'However when facing an opponent the effective stack size you are playing for '
 'is that of the player with the smaller stack In essence when two players '
 'face off the amount of the smaller stack is the most that can be lost by the '
 'larger stack This concept is important as a chip leader may have significant '
 'chips and never be at risk of being eliminated However a smaller stack with '
 'fold equity may still be able to push allin on a large stack if that large '
 'stack does not want to lose unnecessary chips Overall the larger stack needs '
 'to be fully aware of the short stacks around the table and act accordingly '
 'Odds of hand versus hand Since a satellite has such a low average stack of  '
 'there will be many allin bets during the later levels To call an allin bet '
 'one must be familiar with the odds of your hand versus another hand Here are '
 'common situations with their approximate percentages that you must consider '
 'before calling an allin bet You may be surprised by some of the ratios and '
 'may reconsider before calling an allin bet for a significant amount of your '
 'stack Common hands example Approximate odds ratio Pair over pair AA vs QQ  '
 'Same card different kicker AK vs  or KJ vs QJ  Pair vs one overcard  vs   '
 'Two overcards vs two undercards KJ vs   One over and middle card vs in '
 'between and lower card AQ vs KJ  One over and lower card vs middle cards  vs '
 'KQ  Two overcards vs underpair AK vs JJ  Commonly referred to as a race or '
 'coinflip due to its  nature',
 'Strategy prior to the start You may believe that the information gathering '
 'process concerning your opponents begins when the first hand is dealt I '
 'disagree You should start observing your opponents the second you arrive at '
 'your table Listen to your opponents Listen to the players talking with each '
 'other Some players will brag that they have already won a seat or two into '
 'the Main Event Other players will bemoan their luck stating that they have '
 'tried multiple times to qualify only to fall short Some will declare that if '
 'they do not qualify they will not play as they cannot afford to buy into the '
 'larger buyin event All of this critical information will help you make '
 'better decisions versus your opponents during the satellite If a player '
 'already has earned a seat he or she probably will not play as tight as usual '
 'taking more chances to win another seat and the subsequent cash In essence '
 'the player has nothing to lose except the buyin for the satellite and '
 'everything to gain You have to be wary of attacking this players blinds and '
 'reraising them without a solid hand If a player desperately wants to play in '
 'the larger buyin event but has not earned his or her seat he or she will '
 'probably play much tighter than the average player Thus you would be able to '
 'attack their blinds and possibly reraise this opponent as he or she would '
 'not want to risk being eliminated from the satellite without the nuts As for '
 'yourself try not to divulge any information about your own status as you '
 'could be giving away valuable information to others and they may thus play '
 'better against you I am not suggesting that you be rude to the other players '
 'but try to avoid answering the question if someone asks Calculate ending '
 'level A crucial piece of information that you can determine before the '
 'tournament begins is at which level the bubble will burst This calculation '
 'is relatively easy Since I have already stated that the average stack near '
 'the end of the tournament will be approximately  you multiply the number of '
 'entries needed for one seat by the number of starting chips and then divide '
 'by  This answer will be the approximate big blind amount for the level when '
 'the bubble will burst The final blind level will very rarely be more than '
 'one more level from this calculation See the formula below Number of entries '
 'needed for one seat x number of starting  big blind of final level Example  '
 'If the buyin is  for a  tournament the satellite will give out one seat for '
 'every  players If the satellite starts with  in chips the approximate big '
 'blind level will be  Tip A common  in  satellite will typically end in the '
 'blind level where the big blind is the same as your original starting stack '
 'Example  If the buyin is  for a  tournament the satellite will give out one '
 'seat for every six players If',
 'the satellite starts with  in chips multiply  times  which equals  After '
 'dividing by  you find that the approximate ending level will have a big '
 'blind of  This calculation is extremely important since you will know to '
 'what level you have to survive in order to win a seat whereas other players '
 'may not You will be able to understand that there is no need to have an '
 'enormous chip stack late in the satellite You will only need to survive '
 'approximately until this level Knowing at which level the satellite will end '
 'is a huge advantage compared to the lack of information the other players '
 'have Strategy in the early levels I would define the early levels as the '
 'first four to six levels depending on the starting stack These levels '
 'include the ones without antes and possibly the first couple of levels with '
 'antes Overall I would consider the early levels to be those from the start '
 'of the satellite to the level where the big blind is about  of the starting '
 'stack eg if the starting stack is  then the last early level in this '
 'particular satellite would be  with a  ante During these initial levels '
 'players utilize many different styles of play My recommendation would be to '
 'employ the classic tight aggressive style to accumulate chips early on '
 'Additionally I would make continuation bets with the small ball strategy '
 'popularized by poker superstar Daniel Negreanu Overall this style advocates '
 'betting small amounts preflop around  and keeping the pots small in order to '
 'keep your risk low The concept also assumes that players will be less apt to '
 'make allin bluff bets when in small pots as opposed to bloated pots The goal '
 'is to steadily increase your stack with this style However you must be wary '
 'with missed flops because you cannot afford to lose significant chips early '
 'on in a satellite After missing a flop eg you raise with AK and the flop '
 'comes  I would recommend only making one continuation bet for the remainder '
 'of the hand whether on the flop turn or even possibly the river Betting '
 'twice or three times referred to as double or triple barreling with no made '
 'hand can easily result in you becoming short stacked or result in your '
 'elimination from the satellite Nevertheless I would consider taking some '
 'slight chances in unopened pots in position from the late position seats '
 'such as the hijack cutoff and button Calling or even minraising preflop with '
 'two high cards small pairs or even suited connectors should be considered '
 'during the early levels of a satellite The reason I would suggest this '
 'strategy during the early levels is that you would never put more than  of '
 'your stack in jeopardy for the first preflop call Remember if you flop a '
 'flush or straight draw or top pair you will have to put in an additional bet '
 'which will probably be more than  of your stack In the end you dont want to '
 'get too short stacked during the early levels by taking even calculated '
 'risks If you miss the flop completely you can easily fold and not deplete '
 'your stack significantly As for paying attention to your opponents I would '
 'continue to listen to the players at your table They may provide information '
 'that you can use Also new players will be registering later and players will '
 'be moved from other tables as they break Be sure to pay close attention to '
 'your opponents at all times You should pay closest attention to the players '
 'to your left especially for any possible folding tells If these players '
 'prepare to fold before the action gets to them take full advantage of this '
 'information later in the tournament especially during the middle levels '
 'where the blinds and antes are significantly higher As for the players on '
 'your right try to determine if they have any betting patterns or other tells '
 'that indicate whether they missed the flop This information will allow you '
 'to take down pots with little resistance',
 'whether they missed the flop This information will allow you to take down '
 'pots with little resistance after your opponent checks as you will usually '
 'be in position against them Overall the early levels are an excellent '
 'opportunity to gather information about your opponents to',
 'utilize later in the satellite Premium hands For satellites if you are able '
 'to double up a couple of times during the early levels you often have an '
 'excellent chance to advance and earn your seat Thus if you pick up a huge '
 'hand early in the satellite such as AA or flop a set you need to be patient '
 'and try to get as many of your opponents chips as possible Remember you only '
 'get dealt AA once out of every  hands dealt and flop a set only once out of  '
 'times when holding a pair Thus you must take advantage of these '
 'opportunities when they occur so you can build your stack and capture a seat '
 'Although this sounds like a solid plan in principle you must be prepared for '
 'your opponent to outdraw you on occasion While those moments sting when your '
 'opponent catches a flush on the river or hits a two outer for a set I '
 'recommend taking those calculated risks to try to build your stack early in '
 'the satellite I dont want you to be foolishly passive such as by limping '
 'with AA and allowing five other players to join the pot for only a small '
 'investment But neither should you overbet the pot in order to chase away '
 'your opponents fearing they will out flop you or catch their flush on the '
 'river You need to risk a little for the opportunity to gain a lot of chips '
 'Rebuy Some satellites such as at the WSOP have the option of rebuys thus you '
 'can reenter the satellite even if you were eliminated You receive a new '
 'starting stack and enter the event at the level you rebought This rebuy is '
 'typically allowed during the early levels ending around the fourth to sixth '
 'level Gathering information about your opponents can help in these '
 'situations as well If an opponent shows no regard for the low satellite '
 'buyin they may take huge chances early knowing they can rebuy You must be '
 'wary of these players as they will be willing to gamble to eliminate you '
 'even with an inferior hand Also you must make your own personal decision '
 'whether you are prepared to rebuy If the answer is yes you may want to take '
 'a few more risks If the answer is no you must be more selective about the '
 'hands with which you risk your stack Additionally even if a player is '
 'eliminated from the satellite he or she may return in a rebuy event Thus the '
 'information you gathered on this opponent may not go to waste Strategy in '
 'the middle levels As you begin the middle levels you will be pleasantly '
 'surprised that over onethird of the entries have already been eliminated '
 'Sometimes the player pool is even cut in half If you have survived to this '
 'stage in the satellite these critical middle levels will determine whether '
 'you will get your seat or are eliminated The middle levels begin when the '
 'big blind is initially larger than  of the starting stack which is often '
 'around level  to  This stage concludes when the number of players remaining '
 'is twice the number of players who will earn a seat into the Main Event Of '
 'course never stop paying attention to your opponents New players will '
 'continue to show up at your table or you will be reseated at another table '
 'as tables continue to break with every elimination During these middle '
 'levels you can capitalize on the information that you have already gathered '
 'For example if',
 'you find a person seated to your left who possesses a folding tell you have '
 'an ideal situation Anytime that you are seated in the cutoff or button and '
 'the action has folded to you you should raise with any two cards if you '
 'recognize that the players in the blinds will fold Picking up these blinds '
 'and antes is critical for your ultimate success As play continues remember '
 'the number one goal is survival Thus your playing style should remain '
 'classically tight aggressive however your days of taking slight chances are '
 'over Even if you have a very large stack there is no reason to take these '
 'risks as you just need to maintain your stack to earn your seat Remember you '
 'are not trying to collect all the chips Instead you are just trying to have '
 'any amount of chips when the bubble bursts Inevitably your satellite life '
 'may come down to a classic race situation For example an average stack '
 'raises from middle position and you look down at JJ from the button With '
 'about  you decided that it is time to make a stand and you push allin After '
 'the blinds fold the initial raiser calls with AQ and the race is on Here is '
 'how I play when I have a particular stack during this level Big stack '
 'greater than  If you have a big stack there is no reason to risk your chips '
 'Continue to play tight aggressive especially in position versus medium '
 'stacks Utilize any tells that you may have against your opponents especially '
 'versus the players to your left when they are in the blinds However if you '
 'are attacking blinds only do so against players with medium stacks or '
 'ultratight big stacks Be wary of the very short stacks because their '
 'effective stack size will possibly result in them shoving allin with any two '
 'cards out of desperation Overall as a big stack you want to slowly build '
 'your stack with little risk Do not feel the need to eliminate players with '
 'marginal holdings Let the other players do the dirty work for you while you '
 'conserve your chips for better spots Medium stack  to  If you hold this type '
 'of chip stack you should turn to conservative mode and dont take any major '
 'risks Over the years I have seen so many players during these levels play '
 'way too many hands I would suggest only playing hands that you would be '
 'willing to go allin with If you would not be willing to risk your entire '
 'stack then do not even put in an initial raise with hands like  or KJ Just '
 'fold This style may seem almost too tight but remember that you are playing '
 'to survive If you raise to  and have to fold to a reraise you have lost the '
 'equivalent of an entire orbit of blinds and antes With the blind levels in a '
 'satellite often only  to  minutes one orbit could take an entire level Thus '
 'if you lose one of your raises those chips could be the equivalent of '
 'surviving one more level In the end this could be the difference between '
 'winning a seat or not One major exception is when the action is folded to '
 'you while sitting in late position and the players to your left are medium '
 'stacks especially if these players are playing very conservative or '
 'ultratight big stacks This situation is too opportune and you must take '
 'advantage by raising the blinds especially if you are able to detect a '
 'folding tell from one of your opponents Although I stated before that losing '
 'a raised bet is the equivalent of one orbit of hands stealing one set of '
 'blinds and antes is also adding another possible level Ultimately this aids '
 'in your number one goal survival',
 'Short stack less than  For many players this stack size is the one they '
 'dread the most For me a short stack is the easiest to play because there are '
 'very few decisions I believe that you have only two moves fold or move allin '
 'The optimal situation would be to reraise allin over someones original raise '
 'also referred to as  This specific move allows you to pick up not only the '
 'blinds and antes but also the initial raise which as we mentioned before is '
 'the equivalent of one orbit of bets and sometimes an entire level Thus a '
 'successful  often wins you two sets of blinds and antes or two orbits around '
 'the table However you have to be aware of your fold equity Once you lose '
 'your fold equity you can no longer simply move allin with any two cards The '
 'following formula determines whether you have enough fold equity to wait one '
 'or two more cycles for solid cards or whether you barely have enough fold '
 'equity to push allin with any two cards Use the following short stack '
 'strategy formula to utilize fold equity in order to survive Short stack '
 'strategy formula First calculate the starting pot size SPS which is equal to '
 'the blinds plus antes This calculation is critical for this short stack '
 'strategy Begin calculating when you have approximately  remaining Then '
 'utilize the following steps to determine your action  Count your chip stack '
 'when you are on the button  Determine SPS  Subtract SPS from your current '
 'chip stack  Does your amount of remaining chips have enough fold equity can '
 'you make the stacks behind you fold which often requires a bet of at least  '
 'to   If YES continue to wait for solid cards eg a hand that you are prepared '
 'to go allin with a slightly broader range as you are short stacked and '
 'repeat step  If NO go to step   Push allin the first opportunity you have to '
 'open the pot in order to utilize your fold equity before it disappears '
 'Remember it is very hard to call an allin bet with a weak hand and your '
 'opponents want to survive as well note do not do this if someone has raised '
 'in front of you Note when pushing allin during this situation with any two '
 'cards make sure that you look at your cards carefully You want to act as if '
 'you are looking down at two aces so you do not give away any tells of '
 'weakness Short stack strategy question You are on the button and have  chips '
 'remaining  players at the table blinds of  antes  No one at the table has '
 'more than  chips Will you still have fold equity after blinding down one '
 'more orbit Short stack strategy answer SPS  Subtract    Fold equity YES The '
 'formula states that you will have about  once the blinds go through you one '
 'more time Nevertheless I believe that you have enough fold equity as your '
 'stack size can still do significant damage to other players stacks including '
 'the chip leader Thus you do not have to make a rash decision this orbit Wait '
 'for solid cards while opening up your range slightly Now that you have '
 'determined you have enough fold equity after one orbit lets determine if you '
 'can wait another orbit',
 'Subtract    Fold equity NO However if you subtract one more SPS your stack '
 'would be at  chips This stack size would probably not have enough fold '
 'equity Thus if you do not pick up a solid hand after the blinds and antes go '
 'through you once and your stack is at  you must push allin with any two '
 'cards at the first opportunity This ability to push allin with any two cards '
 'while possessing fold equity is sometimes very difficult for players to '
 'execute Some players just cant pull the trigger without a decent hand Others '
 'only think of the negative result Nevertheless this strategy is critical for '
 'your satellite success If you do not overcome your fear of elimination and '
 'utilize your fold equity before it disappears completely you will not be '
 'successful in satellites Watch out Although the formula is fairly '
 'straightforward there are some specific situations to watch out for The '
 'small blind andor big blind is short stacked Their effective stack size may '
 'lead to them calling with any two cards as they are in desperation mode like '
 'yourself The small blind or big blind is the chip leader They may call with '
 'any two cards as they may think they have chips to burn and want to '
 'eliminate you The player to your left is an aggressive chip leader They may '
 'call with any two cards as they have enough chips to risk and may want to '
 'eliminate you You may have to execute this short stack strategy one orbit '
 'earlier due to this opponent The blind level is about to increase before the '
 'orbit is complete The blinds increasing will affect SPS formula calculation '
 'and possibly your fold equity If this timing will occur before the blinds '
 'get to you I would calculate the SPS with the higher blind level to '
 'determine if you have enough fold equity The bubble is about to burst '
 'Although you have little fold equity there may be a player or two with fewer '
 'chips than you thus you may not want to risk getting eliminated and hope '
 'that one of the shorter stacks is eliminated before you Strategy in the late '
 'levels I define this stage of the satellite as when the number of players '
 'remaining is about twice as many as the number of seats being given out '
 'These levels are fairly straightforward and it becomes effectively a game of '
 'chicken Regularly many short and middle stacks just shove allin and there is '
 'rarely much postflop play Ultimately the remaining players have to be dealt '
 'a significant hand to call Nevertheless most players fold which is often the '
 'correct choice During these levels you can make a lot of huge laydowns and '
 'folding AK or  is not that uncommon Folding even bigger hands is possible '
 'see Interesting situations later in this chapter Most players sit and wait '
 'hoping that the shorter stacks become so depleted that they lose their fold '
 'equity Eventually bigger stacks that can afford to take the risk will call '
 'them down However due to the nature',
 'of this play the average stack begins to dwindle near the  mark that I '
 'mentioned earlier in this chapter One substantial advantage that you possess '
 'is the knowledge of approximately at which level the bubble will burst see '
 'Strategy prior to the start As you look at the structure sheet Im sure that '
 'you wish it would be sooner than is calculated Nevertheless many players '
 'will guess it will occur sooner than it actually does This miscalculation '
 'often leads to your opponents becoming short stacked too soon and falling '
 'short of their ultimate goal You on the other hand armed with the correct '
 'data can carefully plot out how many more orbits and subsequently how many '
 'more blinds and antes you will need to steal in order to get your seat Big '
 'stack greater than  You are in great shape The odds are that you only have '
 'to maintain your stack not increase it Determine how many more orbits it '
 'will take to burst the bubble typically each orbit takes around  minutes '
 'Then calculate the SPS of each orbit remember to consider the increased '
 'blind levels and subtract this total from your current chip stack If you end '
 'up with more than  you can sit back and relax You have your seat If you end '
 'up with about  you will probably need to steal at least one or two more sets '
 'of blinds and antes to be comfortable Remember just because you are a big '
 'stack does not require you to play sheriff and call off the shorter stacks '
 'just to try to eliminate them Conserve your chips and just get your seat To '
 'reiterate let others do the dirty work for you Medium stack  to  Once again '
 'you are in good shape but you will probably need to steal at least a few '
 'more blinds and antes Focus on the players to your left who have folding '
 'tells who are medium stacked especially if this player is playing very '
 'conservatively or who are ultratight big stacks When sitting in late '
 'position you must take advantage of the circumstances and steal the blinds '
 'and antes However do not play too many hands Besides playing in position '
 'discussed above limit your hands to ones where you feel extremely confident '
 'and would be willing to go allin If you are on the lower end of this blind '
 'range I would just push allin to put maximum pressure on your opponents '
 'Short stack less than  Utilize the short stack strategy that I describe in '
 'the previous section see Strategy in the middle levels Above all you must '
 'maintain fold equity and do everything you can to SURVIVE Also remember you '
 'can push allin with any two cards but cant call with any two cards Strategy '
 'on the bubble I define this stage as when only one or two players remain to '
 'be eliminated before the satellite is completed often when the remaining '
 'tables are playing handforhand During handforhand play all remaining tables '
 'deal one hand simultaneously After one table finishes the hand they must '
 'wait for all subsequent tables to complete their hand before dealing another '
 'one This methodology prevents stalling',
 'and promotes fairness among all the players as there is a lot at stake The '
 'play at this stage is very black and white players will take down the pot '
 'uncontested preflop or there will be an allin and a call Big stack greater '
 'than  and medium stack  to  You are in great shape You basically dont have '
 'to play another hand The only time I would consider calling is when you have '
 'a premium hand and your opponent has less than  of your stack You can easily '
 'fold even AA if the situation was just right see Interesting situations '
 'later in this chapter Short stack less than  While in other stages of the '
 'tournament this stack is the danger zone amazingly you could already be safe '
 'especially if there are multiple players with shorter stacks than you If '
 'there are multiple tables remaining try to get a sense of who is short '
 'stacked before you go handforhand especially if there are multiple players '
 'who have stacks shorter than yours Also during this period the tournament '
 'directors will often threaten to penalize you if you walk around to see '
 'other players stacks Therefore if you have someone rooting you on ask him or '
 'her to take a look at the other tables to see if there are any shorter '
 'stacks You can even ask a friend who is playing at another table if there '
 'are any shorter stacks at his or her table Many players will look at the '
 'average stack and fear elimination if they fall near or below that number '
 'However in a satellite this is an overblown statistic and can create '
 'unnecessary fear Overemphasis on average stack statistic Many players get '
 'too caught up with this statistic and feel they are in jeopardy if they fall '
 'below the average stack However since there are so few players remaining and '
 'inevitably there are one or two huge chip stacks the relative average stack '
 'is much lower than the actual calculated average The following example will '
 'show you that you are not in jeopardy if you hold an average stack and may '
 'even be in excellent shape Average stack statistic example Starting '
 'information  players  starting stack  seats awarded Current status  left '
 'blinds   Total chips  Your stack  Average chip stack  Top two chips stacks  '
 'and  Remaining  players average  Therefore if you held  chips you may have '
 'panicked in the past as you are technically below the average stack Today '
 'you can relax and realize that most of the time you will be able to coast to '
 'a seat as there will definitely be other players with shorter stacks than '
 'you Super short stack less than ',
 'When you possess this stack size the hopeless sick feeling is inevitable '
 'when you are so close on the bubble If there are a few players shorter than '
 'you in chips you may have to cross your fingers and wait it out hoping '
 'someone eliminates one or two of these players before you However if you are '
 'the shortest stack you will have to find a hand and just go with it '
 'Hopefully you will still have some fold equity as one blind and ante steal '
 'should be enough to secure your seat Try to avoid getting into this position '
 'by utilizing the short stack strategy and using your fold equity earlier in '
 'the satellite Interesting situations Hopefully this chapter has helped '
 'clarify the differences between customary MTTs and satellites However there '
 'are additional interesting situations that arise purely because of the '
 'abnormal payout structure of satellites Here are some of these situations '
 'including one that you may consider absolutely shocking Extra money in prize '
 'pool Sometimes there is extra money in the prize pool besides the money '
 'going to the players who win a seat For example in a  satellite if  in  '
 'players get a seat and there are  players there will be seven seats awarded '
 'with  left over for eighth place finisher This additional money is usually '
 'given to the player after the final seat the bubble boy Sometimes that money '
 'is almost as much as a seat itself thus creating the true bubble one spot '
 'before Thus many times players can use these additional funds to make a deal '
 'Deals Although this is not an actual tournament deals are very prevalent in '
 'satellites as well Be creative as there is sometimes nothing worse than '
 'coming so close and just missing getting a seat due to losing a coin flip '
 'This has unfortunately happened to me many times You may consider striking a '
 'deal in order to lock up some value You can use many ways to calculate a '
 'deal such as the ICM model or the chip equity model However if you are the '
 'overwhelming chip leader I would not give up any equity The remaining '
 'players can make a deal but you should try to get the full value of a seat '
 'because you are almost certain not to bubble Folding aces Initially this '
 'seems absurd How can you consider folding the best starting hand However in '
 'the perfect situation during a satellite it is not only plausible but the '
 'correct move In  I wrote a column on this subject for ESPNcompoker The '
 'column became one of the most commented and discussed columns over the past '
 'several years on ESPNcompoker Three years later the exact situation I '
 'discussed occurred in a satellite I played in and I wrote a followup on '
 'ESPNcompoker Here are both columns on this unique concept Muck aces preflop',
 'See  June   Pockets rockets Bullets American Airlines Whatever you want to '
 'call them there is no better starting hand in hold em than aces It is what '
 'everyone hopes to see when they look down at their cards Heads up aces are '
 'about an  percent favorite to win against any two random cards However you '
 'only get dealt aces about  percent of the time or  out of about  hands Since '
 'aces are so rare most people want to make the most of them Some players '
 'choose to raise preflop no matter what position they are in They would '
 'rather take a small pot than allow an opponent to sneak into the pot and '
 'watch their aces lose a huge pot Other players consider slow playing their '
 'aces They dream of tricking their opponents and taking their entire stack of '
 'chips Everyone has seen players on TV make this move completely faking out '
 'their opponent and ultimately taking down a monster pot A few players just '
 'limp in trying to trap an opponent into giving away all their chips After an '
 'opponent raises preflop or bets postflop the aces can come over the top of '
 'their opponent and can ultimately take a huge pot However you would never '
 'consider folding aces preflop right You may You also might think Im just a '
 'bit crazy to even consider this move After all we are talking aces the best '
 'starting hand possible Nonetheless there is one specific time during '
 'satellite tournaments where it can make sense to fold aces preflop During '
 'regular tournament play I concede that it would be impractical to lay down '
 'aces preflop since you are guaranteed to be a huge favorite However '
 'satellite tournaments are slightly different Remember that in a satellite '
 'tournament all of the winners receive the same exact prize whether you '
 'finish as the chip leader or just barely survive the cut holding onto only '
 'one chip Let me illustrate such a situation Early last year I was trying to '
 'qualify for the Foxwoods New England Poker Classics  Main Event via a live '
 'satellite tournament there Play began with about  players Only the top three '
 'finishers would earn a seat into the Main Event Throughout the satellite I '
 'steadily increased my starting chip stack of  with selectively aggressive '
 'play Here are a few significant hands that helped me build up my chip stack  '
 'During Round  I raised in middle position with A J and was called by the '
 'button After flopping Broadway K Q  I decided to slow play by checking '
 'Fortunately he fell right into the trap and pushed allin and of course I '
 'called instantly After he flipped over Q  for two pair the turn  and river A '
 'did not help his hand doubling me up and ending his night  At the beginning '
 'of Round  blinds  and  antes  I looked down to see J  in the big blind After '
 'the small blind called the bet I checked my option to see a flop which '
 'came    After the small blind checked I decided to bet my top pair with  '
 'chips However I was surprised when the small blind declared Allin Having '
 'built a solid tight image the small blind had not made any bluff moves '
 'during the satellite Therefore I decided to lay down my top pair Thankfully '
 'I was correct in my decision as my opponent flashed me her   for top two '
 'pair Although I did not win this hand it was a good laydown allowing me to '
 'survive and conserve my chips for later  At the end of Round  blinds  and  '
 'antes  I caught A K in early position and raised to  After everyone else '
 'folded the big blind decided to call The flop came K   After the big blind '
 'bet  I pushed allin After a moment the big blind decided to fold resulting '
 'in me winning a fairly large pot I may have been able to trap him but I was '
 'slightly concerned about the potential flush andor straight draws',
 'a fairly large pot I may have been able to trap him but I was slightly '
 'concerned about the potential flush andor straight draws About three and '
 'half hours into the satellite I found myself sitting at the final table with '
 'slightly more than the average chip stack  chips As play continued during '
 'Round  blinds  and  antes  the poker gods decided to smile upon me During '
 'one stretch I won  of  hands After another  minutes we were down to four '
 'players and I was the chip leader With  in chips in',
 'play I had  of them the next player directly to my left had  and the other '
 'two were just holding on to try to capture the third seat At this point I '
 'basically could have folded every hand and still won a seat because the '
 'short stack had barely enough chips to make it one time around the table But '
 'the next hand wiped away that strategy Near the end of Round  blinds  and  '
 'antes  I was the small blind and looked down to see A A After the two short '
 'stacks folded I raised the big blind who was second in chips to  Without '
 'hesitation the big blind moved allin Instinctually I called immediately He '
 'flipped over J J After the flop came K   the turn K and the river  brought '
 'no help to him and he walked away the bubble boy At this moment I had won my '
 'seat to the NEPC Main Event instantly becoming a hero to the two short '
 'stacks However replaying the hand in my mind during my drive home I realized '
 'I had clearly made a mistake I should have mucked the aces Lets ignore the '
 'fact that the big blind should have mucked his jacks after I raised based on '
 'the following logic In this instance my aces were an  percent favorite over '
 'my opponents jacks Normally I would take those odds any day But remember I '
 'basically could have walked away from the table and been guaranteed a seat '
 'So why risk losing almost all of my chips on an  percent shot If this was a '
 'regular tournament of course I would have played the aces However in this '
 'satellite scenario all I had to do was finish in the top three not '
 'necessarily take first place Since I felt I definitely had more than an  '
 'percent chance of getting a seat at this point in the satellite I should '
 'have mucked the aces Although some people believed that this concept was '
 'just theory not actual practice almost three years later I wrote another '
 'column after I experienced the exact same situation in a satellite in '
 'Atlantic City Muck aces heres the proof See  March   When I began writing '
 'for ESPNcom in the spring of  I cant believe it has already been three years '
 'I was asked to write about playing in satellites for large buyin events I '
 'wrote about my experiences qualifying for events such as the Foxwoods Poker '
 'Classic and World Series of Poker Main Event In June  I wrote a column that '
 'received a lot of feedback The column was entitled Muck Aces Preflop Well '
 'recently at the WSOP Circuit event at Caesars in Atlantic City NJ theory met '
 'reality Setting the scene During the night before the  buyin WSOP Circuit '
 'Main Event  players registered for the final satellite Seventeen Main Event '
 'seats were up for grabs with the bubble boy the  finisher receiving only  '
 'After more than seven hours of play only  players remained With blinds  '
 'antes  the average stack was just under  everyone began with only  Although '
 'our table did not have anyone with less than  the other table had three '
 'players with less than  These players did not even have enough chips to make '
 'it one rotation around the table It was only a matter of time before the '
 'bubble was burst but before that happened the following hand occurred '
 'Playing handforhand the player sitting under the gun decided to minraise to  '
 'Surprisingly the player two to his left made the call Although I was in the '
 'big blind I quickly mucked my cards We were off to a rare bubble flop    '
 'Although the original caller raised his hand somewhat suggesting that he was '
 'willing to check the hand down the first position player bet  Shrugging his '
 'shoulders his opponent astoundingly made the',
 'call Now this was getting interesting As the buzz quickly spread to the '
 'other players the interested participants especially the short stacks began '
 'to crowd around our table When the dealer turned the  the first position '
 'player immediately moved allin for his remaining chips approximately  '
 'Immediately his opponent who had him covered by about  called and flipped '
 'over Q Q However the first position player revealed A A He was a  favorite '
 'to win this huge pot As the dealer prepared to turn over the river card the '
 'opponent shook his head in disgust realizing he was about to lose the '
 'majority of his chips and become one of the short stacks However lightning '
 'then struck on the river Q Everyone exploded in utter disbelief He hit his '
 'two outer and the first position player was knocked out on the bubble So '
 'lets examine the hand Obviously the first position player should have just '
 'folded his aces He was almost  certain to win his seat with an aboveaverage '
 'stack Heck I had  and I was fully confident I had gotten my seat With most '
 'of the players having fewer chips than him especially the three short stacks '
 'there was no need to risk losing with pocket aces Of course there are '
 'situations in which you would call on the satellite bubble For example if '
 'you had been dealt pocket aces in the big blind and a short stack pushed '
 'allin for only  more In this situation it would make sense to call trying to '
 'eliminate the bubble boy since you still would have plenty of chips even if '
 'you had lost to the short stack If you were one of the short stacks mucking '
 'aces would not be the best course of action because your seat was still in '
 'doubt In that case it probably would be worth the risk to go allin However '
 'in this hand the player in question opened the betting from first position '
 'with a few larger chip stacks sitting behind him Nevertheless after he had '
 'made the original raise he should have taken the hint from his opponent to '
 'check down the hand He still would have had about  left after he lost the '
 'hand which would still have been sufficient to earn his Main Event seat '
 'After spending the last few paragraphs criticizing the first position player '
 'we must also sharply disapprove of the call by his opponent If this column '
 'is recommending folding pocket aces preflop then folding pocket queens seems '
 'truly obvious With over  he was also guaranteed his seat and did not need to '
 'play another hand His implication to check down the hand showed that he did '
 'not want to risk losing his seat however his ambition got the better of him '
 'Overall he never should have called Finally here is another intriguing '
 'suggestion At any stage of the hand the first position player could have '
 'flipped over his hand revealing his pocket aces and made a bet or raise or '
 'pushed allin WSOP Rule  states A player exposing his or her hand with action '
 'pending may incur a penalty but will not have a dead hand Thus his opponent '
 'would have definitely folded after seeing the pocket aces The first position '
 'player may have gotten a  penalty but who cares There was no way he would '
 'have gotten blinded out during this penalty And in all honesty someone would '
 'have probably been eliminated in this time So the next time you are playing '
 'in a satellite and have enough chips to be guaranteed a seat remember that '
 'there is basically no need to play another hand even pocket aces Summary',
 'Players love playing satellites hoping to win their way into a larger buyin '
 'event Often they are disappointed after they do not get their seat because '
 'they play the satellite as if it had the same structure as an MTT I can '
 'assure you they do not they are two completely different games Hopefully '
 'this section will help you recognize the key differences between the two '
 'allowing you to better understand what is needed to become a satellite '

 ' AN OVERVIEW OF POKER TELLS Understanding poker tells well is nowhere near '
 'as important as having a strong strategy But most experienced live players '
 'would agree that tells can be a significant source of edge A rough estimate '
 'is that a good understanding of poker tells will increase a live poker win '
 'rate anywhere from  to  Against a lot of recreational opponents poker tells '
 'will give you even bigger edges When playing against tough observant '
 'competition being unreadable is probably more important than reading your '
 'opponents Having one obvious poker tell can negatively impact your win rate '
 'a lot whereas reading your opponents well will usually only result in a '
 'fairly small increase in a win rate So learning about common behavioral '
 'patterns is just as much about limiting your own behavioral leaks as it is '
 'about detecting those patterns in your opponents General theory of poker '
 'tells In this section well look at some general considerations that are '
 'important to keep in mind when studying poker behavior After that well look '
 'at some of the most common and practically useful poker tells The '
 'reliability of a poker tell A poker tell can be defined as a behavior '
 'exhibited by a player during a hand that is found to contain information '
 'about that players hand We can attempt to rate the reliability of a poker '
 'tell Poker tells can range from being only slightly reliable to being very '
 'reliable In the long run a slightly reliable poker tell would be predictive '
 'of hand strength slightly more than half of the time A very reliable poker '
 'tell would be around  to  predictive of hand strength Very reliable poker '
 'tells are typically only seen from very recreational nonserious players When '
 'you determine that a tell is very reliable for a certain player you can feel '
 'confident basing important decisions almost solely on that information and '
 'deviating greatly from your usual strategy Most poker tells from fairly '
 'experienced players are somewhat reliable meaning that they may be for '
 'example  predictive of hand strength However these less reliable tells can '
 'still be useful This is especially true for situations where a decision '
 'seems to be close from a strategically sound perspective For example you may '
 'be on the fence between a call and a fold when facing a river bet thinking '
 'that making either action will have the same approximate longterm EV Against '
 'good players who are strategically wellbalanced these situations will come '
 'up a lot In such a situation your opponents behavior no matter if you '
 'believe its only a slightly reliable indicator of hand strength can help '
 'sway you one way or another and lead you to better decisions in the long run '
 'Many experienced players say that this is the main value of studying '
 'opponent behavior especially',
 'when playing against decent competition Poker tells wont usually be a big '
 'game changer but they can help inform borderline decisions The frequency of '
 'a poker tell The frequency of a poker tell is an entirely different concept '
 'than is its reliability A poker tell can be very reliable but very '
 'infrequent a tell can also be very frequent but not very reliable For '
 'example lets say a player says Damn  of the time when betting the river with '
 'a strong hand He never says Damn when bluffing His tell is infrequent yet it '
 'is  reliable He only says Damn  of the time with a strong hand But those '
 'times he does say it we can be  sure he has a strong hand This leads to an '
 'important observation about poker tells The absence of a poker tell is not '
 'itself a poker tell In the previous example it would be a mistake to think '
 'something like I heard him say Damn when betting a strong hand a couple '
 'times so when he doesnt say Damn he must be bluffing This players tell only '
 'occurs  of the time when betting a strong hand so it would be a mistake to '
 'assume that the absence of this behavior is meaningful Mathematically it is '
 'actually very slightly meaningful but for all intents and purposes it is so '
 'slight as to be unimportant This means that youd really only be factoring '
 'this players behavior into your decisionmaking process when he says Damn and '
 'not the times he is silent The lack of a poker tell only becomes a poker '
 'tell itself if the behavior is both highly reliable and very frequent For an '
 'extreme example if this player said Damn when bluffing the river  of the '
 'time then those times when he didnt say Damn would all be correlated to '
 'value bets But most realworld poker tells even the ones that are highly '
 'reliable are fairly infrequent so youll usually be focusing on a behavior '
 'and not the absence of that behavior This is an important concept and '
 'understanding it will help you avoid logical mistakes in interpreting '
 'behavior The importance of correlation When basing decisions on behavior you '
 'ideally want to have some correlation meaning you have a reason to believe a '
 'players behavior is likely to suggest a certain thing Ideally correlation '
 'will be playerspecific meaning youve noticed that a specific players '
 'behavior is reliable in some way If youre very experienced at playing live '
 'though you can sometimes make reads based on a more general correlation For '
 'example if youve categorized an opponent as a recreational player you may '
 'feel comfortable basing decisions on his behavior if you know that it fits a '
 'general pattern that many recreational players often have Making such '
 'general cold reads will be a judgment call though and will be based on your '
 'own experience and confidence Ideally youd always prefer to have '
 'playerspecific information The importance of situation When studying poker '
 'behavior its important to realize the importance of the situation This is '
 'because the',
 'same behavior can mean two completely different things when observed in '
 'different situations The two main situational categories are waitingtoact '
 'and postbet I originated these categories in my book Reading Poker Tells '
 'Here are short definitions of these categories Waitingtoact behavior '
 'behavior observed when a player is waiting for an opponent to act Postbet '
 'behavior behavior observed after an opponent has bet The feelings and '
 'motivations of players in these two situations can be very different For '
 'example a player who has made a bet is in a more potentially stressful '
 'situation than a player who is waiting to act A player who has made a bet '
 'will often be either bluffing or valuebetting especially as the hand gets '
 'closer to the final round of betting and these polarizations in hand '
 'strength will sometimes result in a polarization of behavior Also a player '
 'who has made a bet is also more likely to be studied by an opponent which '
 'can also be potentially stressful Waitingtoact players on the other hand '
 'dont feel as much stress theyre not making a potentially stressful bet and '
 'theyre usually not being studied by an opponent They have less at stake at '
 'that specific moment and are generally more relaxed Heres an example of why '
 'considering these situations can be so important Your opponent when waiting '
 'to act with a weak hand may have a tendency of staring at you in a defensive '
 'attempt to prevent you from betting The same player may after betting with a '
 'strong hand have a tendency of staring at you due to being relaxed and '
 'wanting to goad you into calling This player exhibits the same behavior '
 'looking at you but the behavior has two completely opposite meanings '
 'depending largely on the situation Without factoring in the importance of '
 'the situation you might think something like I saw him staring at me when I '
 'was betting earlier and he was weak and now hes staring at me after he bet '
 'so he must be weak Not understanding this concept is a major reason why many '
 'players arent able to successfully find and use poker tells Besides these '
 'two main situational categories there are many other factors that can '
 'influence a situation and make it different from other ones The more you '
 'play live the more youre able to recognize how one situation is different '
 'from or similar to another situation This can lead to a better understanding '
 'of behavioral changes Hand strength definition and polarization Another '
 'important situational factor is how welldefined a players hand strength is '
 'likely to be The more defined a players hand strength is likely to be the '
 'more likely it becomes that a betrelated behavior will be meaningful We are '
 'talking here mainly about tells of relaxation or anxiety from a bettor there '
 'are other more casual behaviors that can also be meaningful The last round '
 'of betting shows the most extreme example of this concept On the river a '
 'bettor almost always knows whether he is valuebetting or bluffing When this '
 'player makes a significant bet his hand strength is almost always polarized '
 'so his behavior is more likely to be polarized and more likely to be '
 'meaningful At the other extreme end of the spectrum in the first round of '
 'betting preflop in holdemtype games hand strength is unlikely to be '
 'welldefined With almost all starting hands players are genuinely ambivalent '
 'about whether opponents call or fold The main exception is that almost all '
 'players want to get action with AA and KK The high likelihood of a preflop '
 'bettor being ambivalent means that his behavior has the potential of being '
 'quite varied and therefore it wont be nearly as easy to pin down To put it '
 'simply its hard to get reads from people who genuinely dont care about the '
 'situation and thats often the case preflop',
 'On the flop hand strength is more defined than preflop but is still much '
 'less defined than on the river Its possible for a flop bettor to be betting '
 'a wide variety of hand strengths eg strong draws weak made hands while being '
 'genuinely ambivalent about whether he gets action or not For these reasons '
 'most meaningful betrelated behavior will be found on the turn or river Again '
 'Im speaking mainly about tells related to anxiety or relaxation there are '
 'often meaningful casual tells displayed earlier in a hand As a hand '
 'progresses bets are increasingly likely to indicate more defined hand '
 'strength A few other general factors that influence the likelihood of a '
 'players hand strength being polarized either a strong hand or a bluff are '
 'Large bets the larger a bet the more likely it is to represent a polarized '
 'range Raises with each raise a players range becomes more likely to be '
 'polarized Board texture on highly coordinated boards bets will be more '
 'likely to indicate a polarized range For example a significant bet on a turn '
 'board of     is likely to be the higher end of the straight or a bluff These '
 'points again emphasize the importance of considering the many possible '
 'situational factors when studying behavior Obviously this can be a very '
 'complex area The importance of opponent skill level When trying to interpret '
 'an opponents behavior its important to have a sense of how skilled your '
 'opponent may be Its obviously easier to find reliable poker tells from '
 'amateur players than it is to find tells from experienced players '
 'Recreational players will be more likely to adhere to common general '
 'patterns Youd be much more likely to trust a read you have on a recreational '
 'player than you would be to trust a read on an experienced player '
 'Experienced players are capable of reversing the common meanings of general '
 'patterns ie displaying false tells and more likely to know how to cater '
 'their behavior to certain opponents Sometimes a behavior from a player you '
 'perceive as skilled will lead you to conclude that the behavior youve '
 'noticed is most probably a case of secondlevel deception ie reverse '
 'psychology or a false tell and you will be able to make a decision based on '
 'that A player might be a very skilled online player but be very new to '
 'playing live If you know this you might have more faith in your reads of '
 'that player knowing that he has the potential of leaking information in '
 'fairly common or obvious ways The point is that you should always try to '
 'take your opponents experience and level of thinking into consideration when '
 'interpreting behavior Looking for behavioral variety When trying to find '
 'poker tells the first step is to look for an opponent who displays '
 'behavioral variety This means that an opponent behaves one way in one '
 'situation and later in a similar situation behaves differently For example '
 'lets say in one hand a player bets immediately on the river and in another '
 'hand he takes a long time to bet on the river Without knowing anything yet '
 'about the meaning behind his actions we know that this players behavior is '
 'inconsistent He may still be balanced the presence of behavioral variety '
 'doesnt always indicate the presence of a poker tell The point is that his '
 'behavioral diversity is a clue that makes it likely',
 'that hes imbalanced and that he has a pattern If his behavior were mostly '
 'the same in every situation as the behavior of many skilled professional '
 'players will be there will be less return on investment in studying the '
 'player for possible behavioral patterns Common poker tells The following '
 'patterns are some of the most useful behaviors to look for in your opponents '
 'These are based on my own experience and my conversations over the years '
 'with other more experienced players than myself Keep in mind that these are '
 'general tendencies and wont always be playerspecific tendencies The idea is '
 'that you should try to see if an opponent adheres to a behavioral pattern ie '
 'correlate it before you base a decision on a behavior Also keep in mind that '
 'these patterns are most likely to be useful the more recreational ie non '
 'serious a player is Indicators of folding or interest in waitingtoact '
 'players Its a wellknown concept in poker to look left in order to observe '
 'the behavior of the players immediately behind you Players will sometimes '
 'give away clues to their level of interest or their intention to fold These '
 'are much more likely to occur in multiway pots especially preflop because '
 'players are more at ease and less on guard in these situations Weve all seen '
 'players make it obvious theyre going to fold especially preflop Knowing when '
 'players behind you are folding can make you feel better about calling or '
 'raising with a wider range of hands Besides obvious indicators of folding '
 'though some players will have other more subtle behaviors that give you '
 'information For example preflop a player may tend to hold his cards gripped '
 'in one hand when hes not interested and intends to fold when hes interested '
 'though he may just have his cards sitting on the table with both his hands '
 'over them Waitingtoact players who have strong hands dont like to draw '
 'attention to themselves This is why when you see an opponent behind you '
 'making any ostentatious movements like reaching for chips or putting a chip '
 'down hard on his cards assuming he doesnt always do this or moving around a '
 'lot in general its unlikely that player has a strong hand Shuffling cards '
 'when waiting to act preflop again assuming the player has already looked at '
 'his cards will usually be a sign that the player is waiting to fold Players '
 'who look down at strong hands are likely to be more focused and not likely '
 'to draw attention to themselves Shuffling cards is often an activity done by '
 'people just passing time until they can fold Get in the habit of studying '
 'the two or three players immediately to your left for possible patterns '
 'These players have position on you and can affect your decisions the most '
 'Also because you will be studying them as action gets closer to them it '
 'makes it more likely you will pick up useful bits of information Obviously '
 'all of these kinds of behaviors will only be meaningful for players who look '
 'at their cards before the action gets to them Long looks at hole cards',
 'For players who look at their hole cards before its their turn to act you '
 'can sometimes get information from how long they look at their cards The '
 'most common useful pattern is this players who stare for a while when '
 'initially looking at their hole cards are unlikely to have strong hands The '
 'main reason for this is that players who first look at strong cards often '
 'have an instinct to look away and to not attract attention to their treasure '
 'players looking at weak cards dont have this instinct One example of when '
 'this can be helpful you notice a player in late position staring at his '
 'cards for a few seconds Then when the action comes to him he raises If youve '
 'already noticed this is a generally valuable tell for him you can adjust '
 'your strategy accordingly either reraising him with a wide range or opting '
 'to only call with your very strong hands to trap him This pattern is most '
 'useful preflop but sometimes will come in handy postflop For example a '
 'player studies the flop and then holds his hole cards up to study them for a '
 'few seconds its unlikely this player has connected strongly with the flop or '
 'has much of a hand at all Staring at board cards In a similar way to the '
 'last pattern many players who connect well with the board cards will have a '
 'tendency to look away at least for a moment This is due to that same '
 'instinct described in the last example people have an instinct to avoid '
 'attracting the attention of their enemies to their treasure So for many '
 'players when they continue staring steadily at the board cards it will mean '
 'they probably havent connected in a meaningful way This is why many '
 'experienced players like to study opponents when the board cards arrive Be '
 'aware though that conspicuous studying of opponents will make it more likely '
 'that they will become more stoic and unreadable in response Looks at the '
 'board cards that can be categorized as interested or quizzical are even more '
 'likely to indicate that the player hasnt connected This is because a player '
 'who actually connects in a strong way even if they continue looking at the '
 'flop is unlikely to draw attention to themselves by putting on an unusual '
 'facial expression This is related to the general instinct of waitingtoact '
 'players with strong hands not wanting to draw attention to themselves This '
 'tendency can be useful for deciding when to continuation bet with a weak '
 'hand on multiway flops or deciding when to follow up a continuation bet with '
 'a turn bluff Remember that this is just a general tendency that should be '
 'correlated first Many players will consistently stare at the board cards no '
 'matter what their cards are Defensive chip handling Defensive chip handling '
 'is when a waitingtoact player handles his chips in such a way as to imply '
 'that he may be interested in calling or betting This will almost always be '
 'done defensively with a weak or mediumstrength hand in an effort to '
 'discourage an opponent from betting Youve almost certainly seen the most '
 'obvious examples of this For example a waitingtoact player on the river '
 'grabs his chips and pushes them slightly forward as if ready to call a bet '
 'For most recreational players this will be an instinctually defensive '
 'behavior aimed at discouraging a bet But defensive chip handling can also be '
 'much more subtle A player might just place his hand on or near his chips '
 'this is meant to imply some interest in betting or calling more subtly In '
 'general any out oftheordinary movement from a waitingtoact player will tend '
 'to remove the strongest hands from that players range This is because '
 'waitingtoact players with strong hands as weve mentioned dont like to draw '
 'attention to themselves They are setting a trap and people who set traps '
 'like to be motionless',
 'to avoid scaring away their prey Players who perform defensive chip handling '
 'and other defensive behaviors are capable of calling or folding The bigger '
 'the bet the more likely the player will be folding In fixed limit games '
 'youll see a lot of defensive chip handling behavior followed by a call '
 'because the bets are less consequential In no limit however defensive chip '
 'handling will usually be followed by a fold You should take note whether a '
 'player folds or calls after displaying defensive chip handling this can be '
 'important playerspecific information While an opponent may call or fold to a '
 'bet an important point is this If youre fairly sure an opponent is acting '
 'defensively a raise is very unlikely Ruling out an opponents raise whether '
 'as a bluff or for value can enable you to confidently valuebet some '
 'borderline hands that you might have otherwise checked Note a small '
 'percentage of players like to handle their chips in a seemingly defensive '
 'way when they have strong hands or sometimes with a wide variety of hands '
 'both strong and weak This may be because the player has consciously learned '
 'that its a valuable false tell against experienced players or just due to '
 'some sort of playerspecific quirk Once you notice a player doing such a '
 'thing with a strong hand just note that about the player and adjust '
 'accordingly Defensive verbal behavior In a way related to the last pattern '
 'most verbal behavior from a waitingtoact player will be defensive in nature '
 'This is mainly because as previously stated waitingtoact players with strong '
 'hands dont like to draw attention to themselves The more a verbal statement '
 'can be seen as an obstacle to an opponents action the more likely it becomes '
 'that the statement is said defensively Oftentimes there can be a desperate '
 'quality to these statements this is because the speaker knows they are '
 'folding to a bet and has a motivation to say something no matter what it is '
 'to discourage a bet An example of this the river board is A Q  K J The '
 'waitingtoact player who called the turn now says to the aggressor You can '
 'beat aceking huh The speaker may or may not have AK the point is that its '
 'become very unlikely he has a very strong hand in this case the straight '
 'Like a lot of behaviors this type of verbal behavior will often make us feel '
 'confident eliminating the strongest part of a players range Eyes postbet '
 'situations There are a number of possible patterns related to eye contact '
 'and the movement of a players eyes When studying a players eyes or any '
 'behavior you should remember to consider the importance of the situation The '
 'most meaningful eyerelated behavior will usually be noticed in postbet '
 'situations You should get in the habit of studying a players eyes after hes '
 'made a significant bet When you get to see if that player was betting a '
 'strong hand or a bluff remember how that player acted and what he did with '
 'his eyes In the mainstream literature about poker tells its often been said '
 'that players who stare at you after betting are likely to be bluffing Its '
 'said that these players are trying to intimidate you out of calling and that '
 'a player betting a strong hand would be unlikely to stare at you The truth '
 'however is much more complicated There are two major eye contact behavioral '
 'patterns to look out for',
 'Pattern  Making more eye contact after betting a strong hand due to being '
 'relaxed and not being afraid to interact Making less eye contact after '
 'bluffing due to being anxious and wanting to avoid scrutiny Pattern  Making '
 'less eye contact after betting a strong hand due to wanting to appear weak '
 'Making more eye contact after bluffing in order to appear strong Notice that '
 'these are exactly opposite patterns yet the underlying reasons make logical '
 'sense when considered individually This demonstrates the complexity possible '
 'in this type of behavior and behavior in general Some players wont have any '
 'noticeable patterns when it comes to eye contact The point is that some '
 'players will fall into one of these major patterns so its useful to look for '
 'them In my experience the first pattern is more common This is because most '
 'recreational players are prone to interacting more with opponents after '
 'betting strong hands especially after final bets allin bets or bets on the '
 'river This tendency to interact can take the form of increased eye contact '
 'Most recreational players when bluffing will tend to avoid scrutiny and '
 'interaction and this will lead to less eye contact Also worth noting player '
 'position is important when considering eye contact patterns Its easier to '
 'notice eye contact patterns when a player is seated directly across from an '
 'opponent whereas if the player is sitting beside an opponent these kinds of '
 'behaviors wont be as noticeable The quality of a players eye movements can '
 'also be a clue to that persons level of relaxation A player who bets and '
 'whose eyes move around quickly and loosely for example looking at the table '
 'then his opponent then the TV then the table again is more likely to be '
 'relaxed than a player whose eyes move in a more restrained way A bluffing '
 'player will tend to be more anxious and this will lead to more reserved less '
 'physically loose behavior Eyes waitingforaction situations Some players will '
 'have waitingforaction eye contact patterns The most common pattern is this '
 'making a lot of eye contact when holding a weak or mediumstrength hand This '
 'is often done in a defensive way to discourage a bet in a similar way to '
 'defensive chip handling Many players who have very strong hands who want an '
 'opponent to bet will tend to avoid behaviors that might discourage action '
 'like staring Study your opponents when they are waiting to act As with all '
 'of the poker tells discussed here not everyone will adhere to this pattern '
 'but some will have reliable tendencies of staring steadily at an opponent '
 'when vulnerable and looking down when strong As with the postbet eye contact '
 'behaviors this will be easier to notice when a player is sitting directly '
 'across from you The quality of eye contact can also be a clue For example '
 'some waitingtoact players will stare daggers at you in a very intense sharp '
 'manner the quality of their eye contact makes it even more likely that they '
 'are in a defensive mode Whereas that same players eyes might when he holds a '
 'strong hand have a softer less confrontational quality Try to correlate '
 'these qualities when studying opponents In general the more alert and '
 'confrontational the eyes of waitingtoact players appear the weaker their '
 'hands will be Stillness and movement Some people will have tendencies '
 'related to how loose or restrained their bodies are after making significant '
 'bets In general bluffing players will tend to be more still and physically '
 'restrained than',
 'players betting strong hands This is related to the primitive physical '
 'instinct to freeze up when threatened But you should recognize that this is '
 'a very general tendency and should only be acted upon if you have a good '
 'sense that its an accurate playerspecific tendency Often the most valuable '
 'way this pattern shows up is in small subtle body movements For example lets '
 'say youve seen a player making two big river bets with strong hands Each '
 'time you noticed that he had a lot of small relaxed movements he played with '
 'his chips he flexed his neck his arms moved around a bit his gaze moved to '
 'and from his opponent to the table and back again several times etc Later '
 'you get to see him bluffing and you notice that hes staring stoically at the '
 'board cards and his body is very still with his only movement being his '
 'breathing and maybe an occasional glance toward his opponent Its very likely '
 'this player has this tendency And you should make a mental note to keep '
 'studying him in these postbet situations Sometimes you hear experienced '
 'players talking about sensing an opponents energy or something similar '
 'Antonio Esfandiari is one wellknown player whos popularized this concept in '
 'his poker footage commentary hes frequently talked about being able to get a '
 'sense of whether a betting opponent has it or not and how this is something '
 'you have to be directly beside a person to get a sense of I believe subtle '
 'indicators of stillness and movement are at the heart of this sensing energy '
 'concept For example a bettor whos relaxed will sometimes have small '
 'indicators of physical looseness or anxiety As discussed this behavior can '
 'be very subtle tiny movements breathing patterns etc For an experienced '
 'player like Esfandiari such tiny indicators can perhaps add up to create an '
 'unconscious read Esfandiari may feel that an opponent is weak or strong '
 'without consciously being able to pinpoint the behavior that gave him that '
 'impression Strange behavior As a very general rule bettors who engage in '
 'strange behavior will tend to have strong hands This is for two main reasons '
 'Bluffers tend to want to avoid attention and therefore will tend to act in '
 'normal neutral ways Players with strong hands are often relaxed and this '
 'relaxation can lead to them doing unusual things Strange behavior can be '
 'verbal or physical The more outoftheordinary a behavior is the more likely '
 'it is a sign of relaxation Heres one example of how strange behavior makes '
 'it very likely a player is relaxed A player calls a significant bet preflop '
 'and then raises allin on a flop of    While his opponent thinks the allin '
 'player says You got aces I got two pair Ill show you This player is directly '
 'stating that he called preflop with either   or  this is a strange thing to '
 'want to communicate This makes it likely he is strong in some way It doesnt '
 'necessarily mean that hes telling the truth it just makes it unlikely that '
 'hes weak A bluffer would not want to raise his opponents suspicions with '
 'such an unusual statement If a bluffer aimed to verbally deceive hed be '
 'likely to imply a more normal hand strength Bluffers will generally want to '
 'avoid unusual statements because such statements may make an opponent '
 'suspicious This was based on an actual hand where the speaker had bottom two '
 'pair his hands vulnerability was a factor in him implying strength about his '
 'own hand Another example a player who is usually very restrained and stoic '
 'in his behavior makes a large bet on the river He throws his chips in very '
 'strangely and forcefully spilling them everywhere Some people might '
 'interpret this as a strongmeansweak pattern meaning that the player is '
 'attempting to seem confident so he most likely has a weak hand But actually '
 'for most players this unusual behavior will more likely be an indicator of a '
 'player whos relaxed and who doesnt care how his behavior is',
 'perceived Strong will sometimes mean strong The previous pattern leads to '
 'another important observation about poker behavior oftentimes strong '
 'behavior is indicative of a strong hand Poker tells traditionally have been '
 'thought of as simply strong behavior means a weak hand and weak behavior '
 'means a strong handThis is shortened to strong means weak and weak means '
 'strong This concept was popularized by Mike Caro in his famous book Caros '
 'Book of Tells But this is a simplification of a complex area In practice a '
 'relaxed player with a strong hand is capable of exhibiting a wide range of '
 'behavior while an anxious players behavior will usually be more restrained '
 'to a limited range of behavior This is also why so many useful postbet tells '
 'will indicate strength and not weakness A player who is relaxed is more '
 'capable of acting in a variety of ways whether that behavior seems weak or '
 'strong This is how we can better understand strong when strong behavior from '
 'a lot of recreational players like staring at opponents when holding a '
 'strong hand or forceful confident betting motions from players who have '
 'strong hands Note some players will tend to put on acts of confidence like '
 'betting forcefully or staring at opponents when betting weak hands In my '
 'opinion this is fairly rare though But this is why observing players '
 'tendencies is so important Smiling Real smiles are much more meaningful and '
 'practically useful than fake smiles As weve said a person betting a strong '
 'hand is capable of a wide range of behavior which can include smiling deeply '
 'and sincerely smiling insincerely or not smiling at all On the other hand a '
 'bluffer will usually find it difficult to exhibit a sincere genuine smile '
 'Recognizing genuine smiles from bettors will help you recognize their '
 'relaxation and probable strength Whereas categorizing a bettors smile as '
 'fake will not usually be as useful because players with strong hands are '
 'capable of exhibiting fake smiles So what are the characteristics of real '
 'smiles Real smiles are deeper than fake smiles They involve more of the '
 'mouth Real smiles involve the muscles of the eyes They often crinkle the '
 'outer edges of the eyes into the wellknown crows feet pattern Real smiles '
 'are more dynamic and more likely to have many small facial movements '
 'associated with them whereas fake smiles will often appear pasted on Real '
 'smiles are symmetrical usually involving both sides of the mouth whereas '
 'fake smiles are often asymmetrical and involve only one side of the mouth '
 'Fake smiles will typically only be useful if you have some playerspecific '
 'information to base your decision on For example you might know that a '
 'player often makes small fake smiles when hes trying to appear comfortable '
 'after bluffing Some players will tend to paste on a small subtle smile when '
 'bluffing in a perhaps unconscious attempt to communicate confidence whereas '
 'when they are actually strong they will look more neutral But in a vacuum '
 'without prior player history a fake smile wont tell you much Waitingtoact '
 'smiling is arguably even more practical than postbet smiling but in the '
 'opposite way Often a waitingtoact player who has a strong hand will have an '
 'instinct to hide his pleasure and will tend to be more focused on the '
 'situation This means that most waitingtoact smiling and laughing will come '
 'from players who have weak hands These players often know they are probably '
 'folding to further',
 'betting and so they dont have much incentive to keep on their game face This '
 'is especially true in multiway pots when everyones guard is generally lower '
 'The practical point of this information youd be more likely to bluff a '
 'smiling laughing waitingtoact opponent than you would an opponent who is '
 'neutral and calm Uncertainty concern confusion Whenever a player exhibits '
 'concern or uncertainty whether physical or verbal and then continues in the '
 'hand its likely that the player is strong in some way Players with hands '
 'that are actually vulnerable and who may be continuing in the hand almost '
 'never want to communicate concern Expressions of uncertainty and concern '
 'will usually be instinctually deceptive acts done with strong hands This '
 'behavior is especially likely to be meaningful for a player who bets or '
 'raises but it is also mostly true for players who are calling This is a '
 'wellknown weakmeansstrong pattern This means that most reliable tells will '
 'come from recreational players It also means that most reliable tells of '
 'this kind will be on the more subtle side just because most players know to '
 'avoid the most obvious behavioral patterns Some examples of concerned '
 'uncertain behavior A player shaking his head as if upset with the situation '
 'A players mouth gets thin and stretched out horizontally in the Ive got a '
 'tough decision expression A players shoulders are slumped in a dejected '
 'position this is likely to be meaningful assuming the player doesnt always '
 'do this A player makes what Mike Caro termed poker clack which is the small '
 'clacking sound someone makes when they want to communicate something like '
 'thats too bad A player says hmmm as if uncertain before betting raising or '
 'calling A player shows a lot of pausing or hesitation with his hand '
 'movements before betting raising or calling A player acts confused with the '
 'situation in some way before betting or raising When an opponent shows '
 'concern or uncertainty and continues in the hand you should pay close '
 'attention to the situation and ask yourself what the possible reasons might '
 'be for a player to do that Notes on genuine concern Some beginnerlevel '
 'players will show genuine concern when calling with weaker hands This is '
 'mainly a function of them not realizing how bad it is to truthfully express '
 'their vulnerability You will sometimes see this happen at the lowest poker '
 'stakes but it doesnt happen very often even there Sometimes players will '
 'show genuine signs of concern when they have given up on winning This will '
 'usually be in multiway situations where players have less incentive to avoid '
 'showing their weakness For example a player in a fourway pot who misses his '
 'straight draw on the river says Damn loudly and slams his chips down He has '
 'already decided hes not going to bluff and hes not going to be calling a bet '
 'He has no real incentive besides etiquette to hide his disappointment In a '
 'similar way players will sometimes truthfully state their vulnerability on '
 'earlier streets when they know they will be folding to a bet For example a '
 'player whos on a draw says to his opponent whos gathering chips on the turn '
 'Dont bet Ill fold These kinds of statements can also function as defensive '
 'behavior intended to slow an opponent down When a player expresses concern '
 'in such a way but doesnt fold and continues in the hand as noted you should '
 'be wary Another situation which can influence a player to show his genuine '
 'concern is when he has a good',
 'amount of his stack already in the pot In such a situation the player also '
 'has less incentive to hide information because he thinks it doesnt matter '
 'much anyway For example a tournament player faces a turn bet that would put  '
 'of his remaining stack in This player has a vulnerable overpair and says '
 'worriedly I dont think I can get away from this and eventually goes allin '
 'Hes decided hes either shoving or folding and in his mind he figures it '
 'doesnt matter much what he says his opponent either has some sort of strong '
 'hand and is calling the shove or is weak and will be folding to the shove '
 'Immediate calls Of all the bettiming tells immediate calls are probably the '
 'most generally useful When a player immediately calls a bet it means that '
 'they have immediately ruled out the possibility of raising Because players '
 'with strong hands are often focused on maximizing value and playing their '
 'hand the best way they can this makes it unlikely that an immediate call is '
 'made by a player with a strong hand If a player with a strong hand does '
 'decide to only call he will usually take a few seconds to reach that '
 'decision For these reasons immediate calls will usually indicate weak or '
 'mediumstrength hands Immediate calls will be most practically useful preflop '
 'and on the flop just because this is usually when bets are small enough for '
 'players to be capable of calling with little thought On the turn bets are '
 'bigger and most players will tend to think longer about these bets no matter '
 'what they have Note that a major factor in immediate calls is the time that '
 'has passed during the round An immediate call will be more likely to '
 'indicate a vulnerable hand the more quickly it occurs after new cards have '
 'come out If a player has had a long time to think about what his action '
 'might be for example if his opponent thinks a long time before betting then '
 'his immediate call will be less likely to adhere to the general pattern If '
 'you are bluffing and an opponent immediately calls you this may encourage '
 'you to follow up with a bluff on the next street Though of course this is a '
 'general rule and you should always remember that players are capable of '
 'calling you down with weak or mediumstrength hands If you are betting a '
 'strong hand an opponents immediate call will often mean that a player will '
 'be folding to another normalsized bet in this case you may be influenced to '
 'make your next bet smaller or maybe even to check When considering online '
 'play immediate calls will be one of the few pieces of relevant behavioral '
 'information available to you along with immediate bets Long pauses before '
 'calling or betting arent likely to be meaningful because there are many '
 'possible factors involved using the bathroom being distracted multitabling '
 'etc But when someone calls or bets immediately there are no other factors '
 'involved which means its likely there is meaningful information present '
 'Immediate bets When considering bettiming tells immediate bets are probably '
 'the second most useful behavior behind immediate calls The most common '
 'pattern is this some players will tend to bet more immediately with bluffs '
 'than with strong hands Lets look at some possible reasons for this When '
 'someone makes a significantlysized bet immediately it usually will indicate '
 'a polarized range With mediumstrength hands players typically are motivated '
 'to think about the best possible strategy whether to bet or not how much to '
 'bet etc So immediate large bets will typically be bluffs or very strong '
 'hands For most hand ranges its less common to have a strong hand than it is '
 'to have a weak hand so this means theres a natural bias towards a weaker '
 'range',
 'With strong hands most players will be focused on maximizing value and '
 'playing the hand the best way possible in a similar way to how players often '
 'need to consider the situation with medium strength hands This means that '
 'there is a natural tendency for players with strong hands to take some time '
 'to think about optimal betsizing and other considerations Bluffers dont have '
 'nearly as much to think about as do players with strong hands A bluffer '
 'usually just knows he has to make a decentsized bet Often a bluffer has '
 'already decided on a previous round that hes going to bluff if he doesnt '
 'improve he has a plan in place which makes an immediate bet on the next '
 'round more likely This is especially true for the aggressor in the hand this '
 'is why so many immediate bluffs will come from the player who was the '
 'previous aggressor in the hand Bluffers also have a motivation to seem '
 'confident One way to appear confident is to bet quickly Conversely players '
 'with strong hands can have the opposite motivation to seem uncertain and '
 'contemplative This is also a factor in making immediate bets more likely to '
 'be weak hands Even with all these factors you should remember that this is '
 'just a general tendency and not a very strong one Weve all seen players make '
 'immediate bets with strong hands and weve all made immediate bets with '
 'strong hands But recognizing that this is a general pattern can help you '
 'look for players who may have reliable versions of this pattern Also being '
 'aware of this general pattern can help you make up your mind in borderline '
 'situations For example if your opponent bets on the river and a call or a '
 'fold seems breakeven from a strategic standpoint you might decide to use the '
 'immediacy of the bet as a tiebreaker Remember that as with immediate calls '
 'there are other factors at work One factor is the length of time a player '
 'has had to think during that round For example if a players immediate bet '
 'comes after an opponent has thought for  seconds and then checked then that '
 'players immediate bet is less likely to be meaningful Also note that the '
 'immediacy of a bet is a relative thing and will depend on what the usual '
 'bettiming in the game is In many cash games a quick river bet might be a bet '
 'that takes from zero to four seconds In tournaments however players usually '
 'take much longer for important decisions so an immediate river bet might be '
 'around ten to fifteen seconds Also as with all behavior a players usual '
 'timing tendencies are important to take into account Some players '
 'consistently act quickly in every situation this is more likely to be true '
 'of online players the bet timing of extremely consistent players is unlikely '
 'to yield much information The speech and talking in general When someone '
 'talks and that talk is associated with a significant bet coming soon before '
 'or after the bet it will generally indicate relaxation and a strong hand The '
 'speech is poker lingo often used to describe players who talk in some way '
 'before or after a bet A speech will usually involve some sort of '
 'justification or comment about the situation For example on the river a '
 'player says Three hearts huh Okay lets see where Im at And then he makes a '
 'big bet Drawing attention to the situation the players hand the board cards '
 'or an opponent makes it likely that this is an example of a speech made with '
 'a strong hand Often a speech will take the form of a subtle misdirection '
 'about the speakers hand strength A misdirection is an attempt to verbally '
 'direct attention away from the true reason behind an action Here are a '
 'couple examples of misdirections On the river Guy Lalibert√© has the nuts '
 'Daniel Negreanu bets Lalibert√© says Not very',
 'convincing and then puts in a large raise Hes implying that Negreanus bet '
 'doesnt convince him that Negreanu has a strong hand this indirectly implies '
 'that he Lalibert√© could be raising with weaker hands because of that In a  '
 'NLHE cash game a player  to  His opponent has pocket aces and says Lets see '
 'how brave this kid is before  to  Hes implying that his raise is intended to '
 'test his opponents bravery which is an attempt to misdirect attention away '
 'from his true reasons for raising Its also a bit goading which also makes it '
 'likely he has a strong hand Whenever someone offers a verbal excuse or '
 'reason for making a bet your alarm bells should go off For most recreational '
 'players this behavior will indicate the opposite of what theyre trying to '
 'imply Amongst experienced players however talking with a strong hand is a '
 'very wellknown pattern This makes it one of the most common false tells More '
 'experienced players are very capable of switching up the common pattern and '
 'talking when bluffing because they know that other players might interpret '
 'this as relaxation and strength For this reason some players will be more '
 'likely to talk when bluffing As with all behaviors your opponents skill '
 'level must be taken into account Exclamations about board cards When new '
 'board cards come and a player makes an immediate comment or exclamation '
 'about the board its unlikely the player has a very strong hand This is '
 'because as weve discussed players who initially look at strong hands have an '
 'instinct to keep quiet and hide their assets This tendency is most useful '
 'for highly coordinated boards because these boards are the most likely ones '
 'to cause a player to make some sort of exclamation For example the flop '
 'comes Q Q Q and a player immediately exclaims Wow Its very unlikely that '
 'this player has a queen Or the river comes J   Q K and a player immediately '
 'chuckles its very unlikely that this player has an ace The more time that '
 'has passed since the new cards have arrived the more time a player has had '
 'to consciously decide to say something This is why this pattern applies most '
 'strongly to immediate exclamations Players with strong hands will still '
 'generally avoid drawing attention to themselves But the more time that has '
 'passed after new cards have arrived the more likely it becomes that a person '
 'will try something tricky that doesnt fit the general pattern Lastsecond '
 'discouragements to calling or folding Sometimes in closingaction situations '
 'ie large river bets or allin bets a bettor will give lastsecond clues to his '
 'strength or weakness by how he attempts to discourage a call or a fold For '
 'example a player bluffs on the river As his opponent puts together chips for '
 'a call the bluffer says Youre really going to call huh If this player really '
 'wanted a call its unlikely he would say or do anything that might get in the '
 'way of the impending call A similar example a player has the nuts on the '
 'river and makes a big bet As his opponent takes his chip off his cards and '
 'starts to get ready to muck the bettor says No shame in folding If the '
 'bettor were bluffing and wanted a fold he would be unlikely to say or do '
 'anything that would get in the way of the impending fold These lastsecond '
 'behaviors can be verbal or physical Heres a nonverbal example a player bets '
 'the river As his opponent puts together chips for a call the bettor breaks '
 'from his stoic pose and takes his chip off his card and picks up his cards '
 'seemingly ready to show his hand If this player wanted a call hed be '
 'unlikely to do something that could theoretically set up',
 'an obstacle to the impending call so this is an indicator that hes probably '
 'bluffing Another example a player bets on the river His opponent shakes his '
 'head and says I dont think I can call this Show me one card The bettor turns '
 'over one card showing four to the straight Because his opponent has stated '
 'that hes probably going to be folding this bettors willingness to do '
 'something out of the ordinary no matter what it is is probably a sign that '
 'he wants to change his opponents mind and that he probably has a strong hand '
 'These lastsecond clues will be of limited use because they will mainly be '
 'present after the bettors opponent has already decided to call or fold these '
 'behaviors will usually just serve to reinforce the opponents alreadymade '
 'decision But for players who are willing to pretend to be calling or folding '
 'these patterns can be another source of information Weakhand and stronghand '
 'statements When players make statements about their own hand strength we can '
 'attempt to classify these as either stronghand statements or weakhand '
 'statements Stronghand statements are statements that strengthen a speakers '
 'hand range in some way Weakhand statements are statements that weaken a '
 'speakers hand range in some way Hand strength statements can be very direct '
 'or very indirect Here are a few examples of stronghand statements ranging '
 'from direct to more indirect Ive got a full house This is obviously a very '
 'direct statement of strength I got there This is obviously a statement of '
 'strength but its more indirect and vague because it doesnt name a specific '
 'hand Im not on a draw This statement indirectly strengthens the speakers '
 'range by removing draws When analyzing the hand strength statements of '
 'players making significant bets the most meaningful observations are as '
 'follows Players betting strong hands are capable of making both stronghand '
 'statements and weakhand statements due to being relaxed Most bluffers will '
 'instinctively avoid weakhand statements As discussed earlier verbal behavior '
 'isnt as simple as weakstatementsmeanstronghands and '
 'strongstatementsmeanweakhands Relaxed bettors are capable of a wider range '
 'of behavior than are anxious bettors The major takeaway from this is that '
 'When a player makes a significant bet and makes a statement that seems to '
 'weaken his range its very likely the player has a strong hand One way this '
 'sometimes comes up is when a player bets the river and his opponent asks '
 'something like Do you have trips and the bettor says Nope A bluffer '
 'virtually never wants to communicate weakness about his hand and if asked '
 'this question would likely keep quiet or say something ambiguous like Maybe '
 'This players willingness to remove a value hand from his range makes it '
 'likely that he has a strong hand Keep in mind that its the response that is '
 'meaningful not the presence of silence or of ambiguous responses the absence '
 'of a poker tell is not a tell The one main exception to this pattern is that '
 'bluffers will sometimes remove the superstrong part of their range in an '
 'attempt to better sell a bluff For example a bluffer bets the river and says '
 'something like I dont have quads Ill tell you that By removing a strong part '
 'of his range hes attempting to',
 'imitate someone who is attempting to get a call by weakening his perceived '
 'range But bluffers will typically only remove hands that are at the very top '
 'of their range and that make up a very small percentage of their possible '
 'range theyd be unlikely to verbally remove a large swath of value hands '
 'Tricky players Some players express concern about relying on poker tells '
 'because its easy for someone to fake a poker tell theyre worried that theyll '
 'be fooled by these false tells But if you keep a few things in mind when '
 'studying poker behavior this will hardly ever be a real concern Ideally you '
 'want to have a sense that a players behavior is fairly reliable before '
 'acting on it If you concentrate mainly on observing recreational players and '
 'if you get a sense of a players level of thinking before basing decisions on '
 'behavior you wont run into many big surprises If you think a player is more '
 'experienced than you you should be less likely to use their behavior as a '
 'decisionpoint This is because experienced players are more likely to a be '
 'behaviorally balanced so that there is no meaningful information to be '
 'gained from their behavior and b know how their behavior is perceived by '
 'opponents and be more capable of tricking them If a player has shown himself '
 'to be tricky and youve seen him exhibit the reverse of a common pattern then '
 'you now know that about that player If a player is tricky youll want to keep '
 'observing him for a bit It could be that the player if he isnt very good '
 'will tend to mainly operate on the second level of deception weakmeansweak '
 'and strongmeansstrong Knowing this about him you might be able to outsmart '
 'him by figuring out his patterns Other times for very tricky and balanced '
 'players you may not be able to find a useful pattern this just means you '
 'should tend to ignore that players behavior Its actually fairly rare for '
 'players to use false tells If you study your opponents for signs of unusual '
 'behavior and instances of reverse psychology you should have a good idea of '
 'whos likely to be tricky and whos likely to be more predictable or nontricky '
 'in their behavior Using false tells Some players make the mistake of '
 'thinking there is a lot of value in using false tells Unless you are a very '
 'experienced live player this will usually be a mistake For one thing its '
 'usually impossible to know how a specific player will react to your behavior '
 'Will your unusual behavior cause your opponent to think you are weak and '
 'call Or cause him to think you are strong and fold Because poker is a game '
 'where deception is assumed its very difficult to predict how various '
 'behaviors will influence an opponent Most of the time players who attempt '
 'false tells will just be introducing extra noise into a situation without a '
 'good idea of how it will affect the outcome Another reason false tells can '
 'be a mistake is that inexperienced players often believe theyre '
 'communicating one thing when in fact theyre communicating the opposite An '
 'example a player has the nuts and bets on the river His opponent considers '
 'In an attempt to look weak this player puts on a tense facial expression and '
 'makes several worried glances at his opponent If his opponent is experienced '
 'however he might have noticed that this player is more likely to display '
 'such unusual behavior only when he is relaxed if this player were bluffing '
 'hed appear more neutral stoic and unreadable By consciously trying to put on '
 'an act of unusual behavior this player is probably behaviorally imbalanced '
 'and risks being exploited by observant players If youre not a very '
 'experienced player Id recommend not trying to use false tells just because '
 'its difficult to be aware of all the factors in a situation That being said '
 'there are some situations where using false tells makes sense My '
 'recommendations',
 'for using false tells are as follows You should use false tells against '
 'players you think are experienced enough to have knowledge of the false tell '
 'youre exhibiting You wouldnt try to display a false tell to a player who was '
 'very inexperienced because you would have no way of knowing how that '
 'behavior would influence their action and you wouldnt display a false tell '
 'to a player who you believed was better than you because they might figure '
 'out what youre doing You should tend to use false tells against players who '
 'are strangers to you Strangers will be likely to assume youre an average '
 'recreational player because this is what most players are and therefore '
 'theyll be more likely to interpret your behavior in the way you want it to '
 'be perceived Players you play with regularly on the other hand are more '
 'likely to have seen your tricks in the past and know what you are capable of '
 'When choosing to use a false tell you usually want to pick a common '
 'behavioral pattern that many decent players are likely to know You should '
 'tend to use false tells mainly when youre already making a logically sound '
 'maneuver You wouldnt want to make a very illogical play and only be relying '
 'on a false tell to get the job done Instead the false tell should be '
 'something that is likely to give your play a better chance of success For '
 'example you might make a strategically logical bluff while performing a '
 'false weakmeansstrong behavior in an attempt to better sell your bluff '
 'Methods for staying unreadable For most serious games staying stoic '
 'unreadable and behaviorally balanced during a hand is the most common and '
 'logical goal That is what most serious players strive for Ive analyzed '
 'skilled online players who were new to live poker and who had glaring poker '
 'tells You could think of these as blind spots in their game Despite having a '
 'strong fundamental understanding of the game these players werent aware of '
 'all of the ways behavioral information might leak out But if youre '
 'experienced and youve made a conscious dedicated effort to understand all of '
 'the possible behavioral leaks I believe its possible for you to be for the '
 'most part unreadable to almost all opponents Even though you probably want '
 'to be unreadable to your opponents you can still foster a fun playing '
 'environment You can still talk and have a good time between hands You might '
 'even have a rule as I generally do that you only enter your unreadable phase '
 'at some predetermined point that makes sense considering your comfort level '
 'For example maybe you only enter your completely stoic pose when one of the '
 'following happens a you are involved in a  pot or b you reach the turn There '
 'are obvious benefits to seeming like you dont take the game too seriously so '
 'Id never advocate everyone becoming silent stoic zombies the entire time '
 'theyre in a hand Of course when playing against very tough opponents it is '
 'admittedly probably best to become a silent stoic zombie during every hand '
 'you play Summary The point of this chapter has been to summarize in brief '
 'some of the most useful points to keep in mind when looking for and '
 'analyzing poker tells You should remember that human behavior is complex and '
 'that poker is inherently a game of deception There are no onesizefitsall '
 'tells and no guarantees that a',
 'given behavior will mean in the future what it has meant in the past With '
 'that caveat you should also know that the more experience you have the more '
 'you will become aware of the factors influencing opponent behavior There is '
 'no substitute for experience I myself have improved substantially since I '
 'first started writing about poker tells and I am always improving '
 'Consciously trying to study poker behavior has made me a better reader of '
 'opponents So I know firsthand that its possible to improve at these softer '
 'more psychological skills Zachary is going to host a LIVE webinar online '

 ' RANGE ANALYSIS THE CORRECT WAY TO ANALYSE POKER HANDS Introduction Nolimit '
 'holdem isnt too difficult of a game Most people just want to make it seem '
 'that way My name is Alexander Fitzgerald Online I go by the cheerful moniker '
 'Assassinato I have been a professional tournament player since  the year I '
 'graduated from high school I have final tabled EPTs multiple FTOPs multiple '
 'SCOOPs and practically every other major tournament you can think of online '
 'Where Ive garnered real attention is in my prowess for strategic '
 'consultation If youve heard of a major backing firm in the last ten years '
 'chances are Ive worked with them When the millions are put down and the '
 'horses are drafted Im the guy they hire to coach up their prodigies I also '
 'do private consulting work for more than  individual clients Ive worked with '
 'Player Of The Year winners and multiple players at the top of the '
 'Pocketfives tournament leader board Ive also consulted with stayat home moms '
 'and senior citizens who work in oil fields In all of my private '
 'consultations my material and lesson plans are the same As Einstein said If '
 'you cant explain it to a sixyearold you dont understand it yourself I do not '
 'dumb anything down for the casual player My lifes work has been to break '
 'down the core elements of poker and find a way to explain them to anyone '
 'Judging by the success of my students Id like to think Ive succeeded What '
 'youre going to find out in the following pages is that success at high '
 'stakes tournaments can be achieved by anyone Many high stakes poker players '
 'are not smarter than you they simply have a natural feel that we do not '
 'possess Blessedly for us poker is not a sport Two hours of watching the NBA '
 'will not give you Michael Jordans vertical leap Two hours of time in the lab '
 'analyzing a hand history certainly could teach you one of Phil Iveys plays '
 'Do many high stakes players possess a table feel that puts them ahead of you '
 'No only a few of them do The rest are faking I am not going to teach you '
 'anything that an eighth grade algebra student couldnt master Take the '
 'principles to heart put in the hours and youll be bluffing people left and '
 'right out of their chips Your age sex sexual preference or race will not '
 'hold you back Im not saying it doesnt take a ton of hard work to become a '
 'high stakes professional Ive been playing poker practically every day for '
 'ten years and I still feel like there is a great deal for me to learn What I '
 'am saying is that it can be done by anybody In the vast majority of cases if '
 'you work harder than your opponents you will win more than your opponents My '
 'goal with this chapter is to make you see that poker is not pure aggression '
 'and trying to trick people It is isolating the variables and working to '
 'manipulate them in a way that benefits you They are',
 'easy to learn and make the game more open to interpretation No seeing into '
 'souls is required Get paid a premium If I were to offer the average person a '
 'choice between  or a coinflip freeroll to win  most would select the  Poker '
 'players would laugh and say theres no difference When I started consulting '
 'work I was always perplexed why so many elderly businessmen did well in '
 'poker often with  of the book smarts that the young guys had When a question '
 'like this came up one day I felt I found the answer You take the  they would '
 'tell me because its solid money You can put it into something else They '
 'never really articulated it well but I felt intuitively they hadnt learned '
 'how to make millions of dollars by accident Their same investing prowess '
 'seems to serve them well in poker tournaments yet the younger players were '
 'largely discounting them Determined to find out what they were discussing I '
 'began studying business moguls In a very telling article entitled The Talent '
 'Myth Malcolm Gladwell discusses a company he observed Their investing '
 'strategy resembles what many poker players would do with infinite funds in '
 'the business world They gave the most accomplished kids from the best '
 'universities all the money they needed There was no investment too far flung '
 'for them If there was a profit in it they took the investment and ran with '
 'their equity Whoever needed to be paid whenever they needed to be paid '
 'whatever they needed to be paid it was all handled The company was Enron It '
 'was a colossal failure Yet Mr Gladwell noticed that many companies that were '
 'more boring and who hired good people not necessarily the most talented '
 'flourished in the business world Why They were practicing a different form '
 'of bankroll management Lets say you and I build a tech company from the '
 'ground up We put  together gather a few of our friends in a garage and '
 'within three years we have a company valued at  I walk into our boardroom '
 'one day to speak with you Friend I say were made What are you talking about '
 'Alex All of it I demand What You ask confused All of it were going to put '
 'the whole thing the whole  down We got a shot here We cant miss it Well '
 'whats the shot You ask Its a  pull on a lead I got If we win we get  back '
 'Thats  we shouldnt be getting But if we lose you ask nervously fearing Im '
 'actually proposing this Oh we lose everything Youd probably laugh me out of '
 'the building if you were the cruel type If you were my friend youd want to '
 'call my wife and ask if Id been going through a stressful time What you '
 'wouldnt do is take the investment Youd know you werent just risking  Youd be '
 'risking the three years of work it took to build that Youd know itd likely '
 'take another three years to get back into this place Thats if you can summon '
 'the excitement you had the first time around if you cant the process might '
 'take longer Youre risking the three years youve already put into it another '
 'three years to rebuild to where you already are and furthermore youre '
 'risking all the money you would have made with the  You have the bankroll '
 'right now to play higher stakes in the business world You have an hourly '
 'rate that is worth something Youre risking the printing press by putting '
 'everything down and you are a printer',
 'All of this is hardly worth  especially when its only  in equity Let me ask '
 'you another question Patrik Antonious Phil Ivey Viktor Blom Phil Hellmuth '
 'Tom Dwan Daniel Negreanu Phil Galfond and Daniel Cates are at a cash game '
 'table Who is the fish I have asked this question to hundreds of people  '
 'answer Hellmuth Its a fair answer The man has never been known for his cash '
 'game prowess Now who is the second fish at the table Pretty much everybody '
 'agrees that Negreanu is the second fish here Heres the funny thing This '
 'table has  holdem titles at it If you remove the two fish you only have two '
 'Two of these guys Phil Ivey and Tom Dwan have been playing the series for '
 'years often with large bracelet bets Phil Ivey the man many consider to be '
 'the best poker player in the world does not have a holdem bracelet Hes been '
 'playing the WSOP for more than a decade Hes often played every single holdem '
 'event Again no bracelet Is it possible that the attack dog mentality that '
 'makes Phil Ivey so good at cash is what is his undoing in tournaments He is '
 'trained to see a dollar of equity and go after it Thats what reportedly puts '
 'his cash game earnings in the tens of millions It makes sense too A dollar '
 'is a dollar in cash However a dollar is not a dollar in tournaments '
 'Tournament dollars Lets pretend were at the final table of a poker '
 'tournament The stars have aligned and somehow ten players each have exactly  '
 'of the chips in the tournament You would agree with me that if everybody is '
 'of the exact same skill level your chances of winning the tournament at this '
 'point are  If you double up on that first hand do your chances of winning '
 'the tournament go to  Imagine you have  of the chips in play and eight other '
 'people have  of the chips in play Blinds are going up regularly Ive posed '
 'this question to many high stakes tournament professionals and  have agreed '
 'that their chances of winning the tournament do not go to  The few who have '
 'disagreed have such an edge on everyone they play against theyre probably '
 'correct in guessing their chances might be closer to  However for the vast '
 'majority of us humans we agree our chances of winning the tournament dont go '
 'up by  The higher end number most professionals agree on is about  You have '
 'a  greater chance of winning the tournament However if you lose Well for '
 'sure you have lost  of a chance to win the tournament This is a serious '
 'problem In a cash game you are playing for a cash currency You can take that '
 'money out onto the streets and exchange it for goods and services However '
 'tournament chips do not serve this purpose They only function to give you a '
 'chance of winning a tournament which can then be exchanged for cash prizes '
 'Since the lions share of prize money is located in the top positions of a '
 'tournament your chances of finishing there are where your real money lies If '
 'you squander these opportunities you are squandering real money You are '
 'risking a  chance of accessing that bevy of cash at the topend for an '
 'additional  Since the amount of tournament chips you are risking is the same '
 'as you are receiving you can deduce that their numerical value doesnt '
 'necessarily reflect their worth The chips youre winning are worth much less '
 'than what youre risking What I have just explained is the basics of ICM or '
 'the Independent Chip Model I dont claim to be an expert in the field '
 'although Ive spoken at length with many of the whiz kids You do not need to '
 'be a mathematically minded person to grasp the functionality of ICM Many of '
 'the people who go off about how much it matters never seem to make much '
 'money at poker I doubt Phil',
 'Hellmuth has ever taken a class in ICM When you watch Hellmuth and Negreanu '
 'play however you can tell theyre well aware of their stacks intended '
 'functionality They see risking all their chips means that they need a huge '
 'edge because the tournament chips theyll receive arent worth what they '
 'risked to gain them The style of play they profess small ball in my mind is '
 'relabeled as stack retention Of course you cannot pass up on most ChipEV '
 'spots afforded to you in a tournament You are participating in a '
 'businessgrowing competition Your task is to last as long as possible That '
 'requires equal attention be paid to survival and growth The balancing act is '
 'vague I truly believe no one has solved it Many of the online players only '
 'focus on the second part of that formula growth If there is a ChipEV spot it '
 'must be taken Practically the entirety of the young poker world laughed when '
 'they saw Hellmuth repeatedly stress over close decisions with  stacks They '
 'seemed to be asking Youre so short youre probably ahead whats the holdup '
 'Hands they would have slammed their chips in with were borderline decisions '
 'for Hellmuth When he folded hands like queens for below  they hooted and '
 'hollered I dont know if Hellmuth or Negreanu would express it in quite my '
 'terms but I believe in those close decisions theyre considering their stacks '
 'usefulness and potential for growth if they fold versus what spot theyd be '
 'in if they called Sometimes when they have a read on one player that makes '
 'the guy practically a broken ATM spitting out money even a substantial edge '
 'might not be worth risking all their chips If they lose theyll have punted '
 'all the future chips they were going to earn from their mark While others '
 'might not see that money going into the pot when they call they do So to '
 'reiterate The small ballers Negreanu and Hellmuth the guys who are focusing '
 'on stack retention and not nailing every dollar out there  holdem titles '
 'Three of them are main events Hellmuth the one Durr wants so badly in a high '
 'stakes cash game has a main event win decades ago and a recent one in Europe '
 'the center of the newschool hyperaggressive online tournament movement These '
 'men have repeatedly walked into the lions den and come out wearing new fur '
 'coats Phil Ivey and Tom Dwan are still fishing for their first holdem '
 'bracelet Name a practitioner of the online player any equity anywhere '
 'tournament model who has achieved the tournament dominance of those '
 'gentlemen Even newer players such as Jason Mercier and Philipp Gruissem seem '
 'to take a more measured approach If youre playing a tournament you need to '
 'realize the name of the game is constant growth You are given a finite '
 'number of hands to mine value from If you put all your Monopoly money down '
 'on an early one you will be given many fewer hands than your opponents I '
 'like to look for  or greater edges When Im raising to pick up the blinds I '
 'like to see everybody fold  more often than what my chip equity calculation '
 'requires That gives me a nice cushion for error and also adjusts for how the '
 'chips Im risking are worth a little more than what Im receiving If its less '
 'than  you have to make a decision Will getting from your stack size now to '
 'another one put you in a more maneuverable state Is your table breaking soon '
 'or will you be able to make use of this advantageous position on a certain '
 'player for a longer period of time How much money do you think that will '
 'equate to Are your opponents better than you at poker If so take any small '
 'edge you can find and make the pot large so they cant outplay you on later '
 'streets Are you vastly superior to the players at your table Be cautious If '
 'you were at a table with Phil Ivey youd be ecstatic to see him get into a '
 'coinflip Youd know he could more effectively grind you down the rest of the '
 'day had he avoided it',
 'youd be ecstatic to see him get into a coinflip Youd know he could more '
 'effectively grind you down the rest of the day had he avoided it You might '
 'want to demand a larger than  edge if busting a player will break an easy '
 'table You might want more than  if the chips you stand to lose would put you '
 'at a stack size where you cant take advantage of several recreational '
 'players at your table',
 'Honestly this is where I think the art of tournament poker comes in I could '
 'write  pages on it and Im not sure Id do the giveandtake process justice It '
 'is important you are conscientiously aware of what youre trying to '
 'accomplish in a poker tournament I think this section will get you on the '
 'right track but youll have to solidify your thinking through your own beats '
 'Flopzilla I do not know who created Flopzilla I do not receive anything for '
 'selling their software In fact theyve infuriated me at times with slow email '
 'responses What I do know about Flopzilla is that it seemed incredibly '
 'difficult to use when I first got a hold of it Once I spent the few hours it '
 'took to understand its nuances I couldnt believe Id ever lived without it A '
 'hand analysis that once would take me hours now takes five minutes using '
 'this program Flopzilla is a hand range calculator It can be used by live '
 'players or online grinders It was  when I bought it Other than Holdem '
 'Manager it is the most useful piece of poker software Ive ever used I '
 'imagine Phil Iveys mind looks something like Flopzilla For mortals like you '
 'and I who cant just visualize a hundred or more different combinations '
 'Flopzilla is a mustbuy It also is a great program for demonstrating how we '
 'could be conceptualizing poker hands beyond abstract descriptions of table '
 'dominance What does each bet mean One of the first hands I show my students '
 'is a raise from the small blind After they see it I ask How often does your '
 'bet need to work mathematically in order for you to raise here with any two '
 'cards Most of the time when I ask this I get an uhhhh response over the '
 'Skype call Players know they should know this but most of them do not Heres '
 'a simple example for you to try Blinds are  You are at a  table The ante is  '
 'so theres  in antes in the pot It is folded around to you in the small blind '
 'You raise to  How often does your bet need to work Id suggest you pull out a '
 'piece of paper and a pen while going through this chapter I have found in my '
 'consultations that people retain about  of what they read If they answer '
 'questions about it later they retain  Since I cant physically be there to '
 'quiz you you need to do it for yourself Every time I ask you a question in '
 'this text physically look away from the book Look to your notepad Now have '
 'your answer Compare it to mine Your bet needs to work  of the time Some of '
 'you might have guessed that but this is where I have to be a stern math '
 'teacher and ask that you show your work Most raises from the small blind '
 'have to work around  of the time Very talented savants have internalized and '
 'perhaps taught it However many cannot show how that number is produced '
 'Imagine you and I are flipping coins for  I ask you Friend how often do you '
 'have to hit your side of the coin here to break even Well duh Alex its  of '
 'the time Correct I say now show me on a calculator If you have a calculator '
 'near you I would implore you to try to produce the  answer on your own If',
 'you discover it naturally its unlikely youll ever forget it You might pull '
 'up that calculator and go Well I have  Im going to win another  if I win I '
 'cant multiply subtract or add to get a fraction So I must divide But wait  '
 'divided by  equals one I dont need to win  of the time That cant be right '
 'Heres how you do it Take the  you throw down onto the table before we flip '
 'the coin Now look how much is in on the table the whole pot We need these '
 'two different numbers The amount you bet was  The pot size is  You divide  '
 'your bet by the size of the pot    This is correct On a neutral EV wager you '
 'need to win  of the time in order to break even Now lets return to our '
 'example where were raising from the small blind How much is your bet here '
 'Remember we raised it to  If you said what seems like the obvious answer  '
 'youve made a very common mistake Your  small blind is not part of your bet '
 'It belongs to the pot not you We are not tracking how much money is invested '
 'We are asking how often your raise needs to work Your actual raise is  You '
 'are risking  to win  the total size of your raise the  big blind and  in '
 'antes To simplify   Many of you might find it strange were counting our  '
 'raise in the  tournament money we win However just like your small blind '
 'once that money enters the pot it is not yours anymore Another way to think '
 'about it is that you are dividing how much you could potentially lose by all '
 'the chips that are going to go back into your stack if the play succeeds How '
 'often does he defend This math is all well and good but how are we supposed '
 'to know if our opponent is going to fold  of the time This is a great '
 'question and fortunately the answer can easily be found If youre using a '
 'statistic tracking program like Holdem Manager you can put on your HeadsUp '
 'Display a statistic called Fold Big Blind to Steal It will tell you what '
 'percentage of the time your player in the big blind is folding to small '
 'blind button and cutoff raises If you want to get more specific you can also '
 'put a statistic called Fold Big Blind to Small Blind Steal I like having '
 'both People react differently to positional raises Some assume every button '
 'raise must be a bluff and they reraise them feverishly Others realize theyre '
 'going to be out of position throughout the whole hand and do not get '
 'involved Some people think when you raise from the small blind that you must '
 'have a big hand because you wouldnt willingly get involved out of position '
 'Others take offense that youd dare enter a pot with them from out of '
 'position Its useful to know who youre dealing with by toggling between the '
 'two numbers Of course if youre playing live you do not have the luxury of a '
 'headsup display HUD Thats when a hand range calculator such as Flopzilla '
 'becomes useful If your bet needs to work  of the time in order to be '
 'profitable with any two cards what percentage of the hands does your '
 'opponent need to defend If youre having trouble with this question try it '
 'this way If your opponent cannot fold more than  times out of a  how many '
 'times must he play The answer seems too simple to many of my students but it '
 'is whatever is left from  which in this case would be  Your opponent needs '
 'to defend  of his hands to make sure you cant raisefold with any two cards '
 'If you put  into a hand range calculator you can see how difficult this '
 'would be to achieve',
 'Diagram  Diagram  As you can see this range is woefully difficult to '
 'actually play back with Our player in the big blind will need to be '
 'defending with  and  Of course we can play around with this range '
 'substituting other hands but there are not many combinations of suited '
 'twogappers Youd still need many of the  offsuits and whatnot to be defending '
 'correctly Furthermore your opponents cant just flat with all of this range '
 'otherwise they are giving you a free look at the flop They must reraise with '
 'all of these hands in order to stop you from making money with any two cards '
 'At the live table you obviously cannot have an iPad open with Flopzilla '
 'Thats why I recommend before you play memorizing the worst hands in some '
 'common ranges Then when you do some quick mental math and you realize how '
 'often your opponent needs to defend you can recall what the worst hand in '
 'that range is If it seems like hes not coming close to defending with that '
 'hand you can proceed with the play Flop quads and fold Imagine that we are '
 'allowed to play on a private table on an online poker site They tell you '
 'they prepared',
 'this table for you just because youre such a nice guy The table has you '
 'playing from the small blind  of the time In fact it has the exact same '
 'blinds and antes as the hand example we just discussed Wait what you ask How '
 'is this good for me This is an awful position at a poker table Yet when you '
 'play at the table for a few hours you understand The action is folded to you '
 'in the small blind every single hand Every single time you raise from the '
 'small blind and your opponent never seems to play In fact you find out after '
 'a few more hours of play that he only plays pocket aces This table that once '
 'looked like an awful waste of time is now a gold mine After  hours you '
 'finally collapse at the computer Two hours later you wake up with the awful '
 'taste of coffeeandsleep breath to discover a notice on the poker program '
 'From now on you will no longer be able to use the cards in your hand The '

 'to break even Its going to work  of the time if your opponent only plays '
 'aces Your cards do not matter The Bellagio fountains Now ask yourself this '
 'question and be honest Did you know how often your bets needed to work A '
 'better question is the following Do you think The Bellagio doesnt know the '
 'exact odds on every single bet that happens within their property No They '
 'built those fountains knowing what every bet required and what exactly would '
 'happen on their tables You know that tournament grinder who everyone thinks '
 'is lucky He or she always seems to have chips deep in every tournament Ever '
 'notice how even when they take a bad beat they seem to have the chips to '
 'continue but when you take a bad beat youre just out The reason they have '
 'that cushion deep in tournaments is because they have a deep understanding '
 'of all these bets Its not some intrinsic quality you lack Those allstars '
 'understand multiple situations when a person is folding too much All those '
 'chips they picked up had nothing to do with reads or luck It was good ol '
 'fashioned work and  grade algebra If you did not know how often your bets '
 'needed to work dont feel disgruntled I didnt know any of this for the first '
 'four years I played poker Ive known players who have made north of  who do '
 'not know any of this Just be grateful for how much further youre going to '
 'get now that you do know whats going on Memorize this When I study poker I '
 'find it useful to write down my observations in a Word document I try to '
 'turn my observations into rules When X and Y occur then Z is possible I '
 'print these out and carry them with me throughout the day for quick review I '
 'also make sure I read them before or after a study session or lesson That '
 'helps me internalize them Ive lost count of how many times this work has '
 'saved me from a tough situation deep in a tournament I will discuss some of '
 'the first betsizing notes I took that I internalized in a moment but first '
 'some questions',
 'If you bet half of the pot on a complete bluff how often does your opponent '
 'need to fold for your bet to be profitable If you bet the size of the pot as '
 'a complete bluff how often does your bet need to succeed How about if you '
 'bet two times the size of the pot You should be able to rattle these off the '
 'top of your head Theyre your poker multiplication tables Without doing any '
 'math how often do you think a bet two times the size of the pot needs to '
 'work  of the time   Lets imagine a cash game pot of  You bet these amounts '
 'on a complete bluff The dealer has mucked your cards but nobody has noticed '
 'The second you are called or raised it will be revealed that you have no '
 'hand If you bet  into a  pot you are risking  and the pot that will come '
 'back to you is    A halfpotsized bet therefore needs to work  of the time If '
 'you bet  into a  pot you will be risking  to win    Your potsized bet needs '
 'to succeed  of the time If you bet  into a  pot you will be risking  to '
 'win    Your bet two times the size of the pot will need to work  of the time '
 'I was surprised by these numbers the first time I wrote them down A bet two '
 'whole times the size of the pot only needs to work  of the time to be '
 'profitable If I were to bet that much my opponents would routinely fold all '
 'but the three or four best hands which meant they were folding  of the time '
 'This is a great example of a concept that would never be readily apparent to '
 'you if you just played When you win with an overbet you dont feel like you '
 'won much compared to what you risked When the overbet fails it feels awful '
 'Only through calm analysis away from the table can we reach a rational '
 'understanding Now lets try something else You can look at the numbers we '
 'derived up top Without doing any math how often do you think that a bet that '
 'is  times the size of the pot needs to work  into a  pot would mean you are '
 'risking  to win  so   Your bet needs to work  of the time Even if your '
 'guesswork answer was off I bet you were much closer to the right answer this '
 'time around Why I teach tournament poker In the past I played cash games for '
 'a living I paid for all my tour expenses in Asia and Europe before I was  by '
 'playing  and  nolimit holdem However Ive always taught tournament poker This '
 'is for the obvious reason that I have more credibility in tournaments but '
 'its also because of how far bet sizing theory can take the average '
 'tournament player Nolimit holdem becomes extremely complicated when youre '
 'ranging players on turn and river situations I will get into how we can '
 'solve for our plays on those streets later but I would not claim to be an '
 'expert on every turn and river There are simply too many combinations to '
 'memorize However the average guy can do a small amount of work and figure '
 'out when it is best to raise and re raise as a bluff preflop It is also '
 'fairly simple to solve for flop plays Saving chips from fruitless '
 'continuation bets is important in cash games but its extremely valuable in '
 'tournament poker where ',
 'could be a significant percentage of your stack If you can get this far in '
 'your analysis you will be cashing in more tournaments than you deserve to '
 'You will be the guy who with the chips hes earned can glide into a more '
 'fortuitous situation later on instead of depending on every flip and premium '
 'hand to hold on Blind stealing Now that weve established some of the basics '
 'of betsizing we will expand into practical applications When I started '
 'playing poker in  I raised whatever cards I felt like whenever I felt like '
 'One day a friend of mine showed me a training video where an instructor went '
 'on for  minutes about how horrible I was He cant raise and fold when he has '
 'less than  Its so easy for someone to put him allin Nobody is going to call '
 'him because of how little implied odds they would have He raises with  '
 'suited or whatever it is from early position and his cards have no value '
 'because hes never seeing a flop I saw a ton of logic in his analysis After '
 'discussing with some other accomplished tournament players I decided to not '
 'raise from a short stack unless I was going to call an allin I promptly lost '
 'six figures I won it all back but it took adjusting this catchall strategy I '
 'only rarely raised when I had a short stack when I was absolutely sure the '
 'players behind me would fold At about this same time some guy named Phil '
 'Hellmuth was winning his  or  bracelet He routinely raisefolded from any '
 'stack he wanted to The forums went off on him What a terrible player the '
 'collective grinder nation seemed to yell from the bowels of cyberspace One '
 'day in a lesson I was teaching some Brazilian kids about how you cant raise '
 'and fold from a shorter stack They challenged me They wanted to know why I '
 'did something only an amateur coach would do I said Trust me on this one '
 'Fortunately for me beginners are some of the greatest teachers on earth They '
 'are not encumbered by convention They said Theres this player named Pessagno '
 'here He always raisefolds from short stacks He is the most consistent player '
 'we have He does nothing but win I thought back to Phil Hellmuths success '
 'While I clutched onto this given tournament concept for longer than I care '
 'to admit I eventually decided I had to try and prove to these kids it was a '
 'bad idea to raisefold when I have a short stack If I was a tennis '
 'professional Id have to study John McEnroes game even if I didnt care for '
 'John McEnroe as a person It was the same in tournament poker with the '
 'flamboyant antics of Phil Hellmuth I went back to the first training videos '
 'and tried to find where this short stack principle was established I couldnt '
 'find it Literally it seemed like some big name pros said it in  and '
 'everybody began repeating it There was no mathematical proof to back it up I '
 'asked a friend of mine to help me with the math to find out chipEV wise when '
 'we could raise and fold from a short stack Note ChipEV means when something '
 'is purely profitable without ICM considerations We already did the simplest '
 'application of this in the first part of this chapter but what would you do '
 'if youre raising into more than just one player Say were opening on the '
 'button We have the dreaded  stack Blinds are  Again were at a  table Theres '
 'a  chip ante You make it  on the button Youre making it  to win  Your bet '
 'needs to succeed  of the time in order to be EV chipwise Well how do we know '
 'if our bet is going to succeed that often First we need to establish some '
 'ranges for what our opponents are playing',
 'Lets say we know theyre the typical tournament pros who feel they have to '
 'move allin or fold in this situation Now lets say theyre both playing the '
 'exact same insane pushing ranges Diagram  Diagram  This range contains every '
 'ace many suited kings any two cards over ten all suited connectors and '
 'almost every suited onegapper It also means that the small blind is jamming  '
 'suited I dont know about you but I dont normally find people willing to jam '
 'with  Why would we use a range like this which seems so unrealistic Because '
 'when were bluffing its a good idea to test your bet against the worstcase '
 'scenario I call this The Terminator Range If you can bluff this impossibly '
 'wide range then you can bluff always So can we bluff these nutcase pushers '
 'Yes we can Here is why If our opponents are  it in with this  of hands and '
 'theyre not calling with anything due to lack of implied odds what percentage '
 'of hands are they folding The correct answer is of course everything else '
 'which is  So we have one guy who is folding  of the time and our bet needs '
 'to work  of the time Were in good shape versus just him but how do we know '
 'how often both players are folding Well we just multiply their folding '
 'ranges like fractions In a traditional calculator you would enter  x   So '
 'both of your opponents are folding  of the time in this situation Since your '
 'raise needed to work  of the time you are barely chipEV here',
 'Now if we have two opponents who are reraising allin with  should we raise '
 'here No the edge is small enough that it is negligible Due to ICM the chips '
 'youre risking are worth more than the chips you stand to win You need to be '
 'offered more of a premium on your investment before you partake However this '
 'is an example of a base line observation Id put in my notes Id write down If '
 'my button raise needs to work  of the time I need to know my opponents are '
 'playing less than  of hands With Flopzilla we can play with the tool to see '
 'what those ranges could be With a couple hours of practice we will be more '
 'precise than  of tournament professionals To account for additional players '
 'youre stealing into you simply multiply more than two fractions For example '
 'when facing three players it would just be  x  x  if there were another '
 'player here defending with  of hands In Flopzilla there is also a neat '
 'feature called dead cards You can put your own hand there and it will '
 'subtract those cards from all your opponents possible combinations You can '
 'use this feature to measure how much an ace blocker would help your cause '
 'Currently Flopzilla does not change the percentage when you subtract cards '
 'in the dead cards feature It will reflect it in a number above the '
 'percentage that says the number of combinations that your opponents can have '
 'Pay attention in the following sections to learn how to wrangle a percentage '
 'from these numbers What if they flat As you can see if someone can raise '
 'this wide its a pretty good idea to be defending with a wide range of hands '
 'Many players have begun doing this by flatting from the big blind Oftentimes '
 'when I teach the math behind blind stealing to a group somebody will go but '
 'what if they flat you AHA I will retort at this time Oh no They flat out of '
 'position and fold when they miss the flop This sounds like  all over again '
 'when online poker was the most profitable it has ever been If you want to '
 'account for a flatting range you can group it with the hands that are also '
 'being  This will be their overall defending range Whatever is left is still '
 'their folding range You can continue to discover whether raising with any '
 'two cards is profitable If you find that the players with wider flatting '
 'ranges are playing enough to make raising as a complete bluff unprofitable '
 'that doesnt necessarily mean you should fold If you find most of their range '
 'is flatting then you should look at their Fold to Continuation Bet statistic '
 'Know that this number is likely higher in practice if youre playing from a '
 'short stack as your opponent will have lost the ability to flat you or raise '
 'your continuation bet as a bluff When their Fold to Continuation Bet is  or '
 'higher that means they are honest on the flop as youre missing the board '
 'about that percentage of the time These players are simply flatting and '
 'gifting you with more chips every time they miss the board This is not a bad '
 'thing If their fold to continuation bet is  or lower perhaps you might '
 'consider a fold preflop Reraise bluffing One of the sexiest plays in nolimit '
 'holdem tournaments is the  bluff Unfortunately players have really beaten it '
 'to death Its harder to pull off now than ever before It seems that many '
 'young guys would rather  away their tournament than feel like they were '
 'slighted by a measly  Ive heard many pros say they dont even try to  bluff '
 'anymore I think thats an extremely backwards adjustment We just need to '
 'become more precise with our  bluffs',
 'One of my favorite places to bluff from is the big blind Many people seem '
 'enamored with the small blind I used to like it because there was only one '
 'person to act behind you and people thought that for you to  out of position '
 'you must have a very good hand People seemed to stop assuming this was a '
 'value hand a few years ago but that hasnt stopped a flood of guys who seem '
 'to only  there as a bluff The reason I like  from the big blind is because '
 'many people size their  from there incorrectly and this provides some cover '
 'An example Again we are at a table where blinds are   chip ante  players at '
 'the table There is  in chips in the pot to start the hand The button opens '
 'to  The small blind folds Its on you in the big blind If you were to  bluff '
 'in this spot before reading this chapter what would your sizing have been If '
 'youre like many tournament players your  would be between  and  So lets say '
 'you make it  here How much are you risking What is your actual bet Oh yes '
 'thats right the  big blind belongs to the pot not you Its nice that they let '
 'you put it into your bet when you  because it makes your raise looks scarier '
 'than it actually is but youre not risking that  chip big blind What youre '
 'really risking is  Youre minraising out of position often with a real piece '
 'of crap hand This is just begging for trouble Instead you should strive to '
 'neutralize their positional advantage Position is important when you have to '
 'play a flop turn and river It doesnt matter so much when you shove  allin '
 'from the small blind Lets try to simulate that scenario with a large  Our '
 'opponent will either have to continue with a range so good we know we wont '
 'be touching a chip in further streets or they will fold Positional '
 'disadvantage nullified If you make it  most people will think youre nuts '
 'Theyll think youre one of those guys who is afraid to get his jacks cracked '
 'What they are certainly not going to think is I bet I can  this guy off of '
 'his hand In reality your bet doesnt need to work too often Youll be risking  '
 'to win  Your bet will need to succeed  of the time in order to be profitable '
 'How can you determine if your opponent is folding  of the time You can check '
 'their Fold to  bet statistic You also should check their Raise First '
 'statistic That Fold to  statistic is cumulative If your opponent is afraid '
 'to open anything from the button because its such an obvious steal spot then '
 'its unlikely hes folding as much as he folds on average Examining where he '
 'opens the most and the least from can be hugely beneficial However what if '
 'no one has  him and we do not have that stat What if were playing live poker '
 'and dont have those numbers Then were going to have to work the ranges The '
 'easy way to do this is halve whatever you think he is opening and realize he '
 'needs to defend with those hands For simplicity lets assume the opponent '
 'needs to defend with  of hands instead of  If he is opening  of the hands '
 'from the button he needs to defend half of those hands in order for you to '
 'not be able to  with any two cards That would be a  range Do you know what '
 'a  range looks like Do you know roughly what the weakest hand in that range '
 'is You must know this information to make these aggressive plays on the fly '
 'Lets start with a basic problem Say our opponent is opening  of the time on '
 'the button over a large sample but we havent seen him react to a  What does '
 'he need to defend with in order to make us not  with any two cards Well lets '
 'give him a starting range Diagram  Its worth noting that this is a fairly '
 'controlled button opening range Its more likely these days that people will '
 'open any suited king any twogapper and other holdings',
 'However since were planning a bluff its intelligent for us to start with a '
 'slightly tighter range than what most people are opening Now below the hand '
 'range tool we see the number of combinations this range represents I cant '
 'tell you how nice it is that there are actual calculators that do this work '
 'for us Back in the old days youd have to add every hands combinations '
 'together by yourself So we see in Diagram  that he is opening  combinations '
 'If our opponent cannot fold more than  of the time he logically needs to '
 'defend  x   combinations We could also halve the percentage from  to  but '
 'Ive found combination counting to be the more precise way of calculating '
 'this Diagram  Lets try to give him the minimum range hed need to defend '
 'which must contain at least  combinations Diagram  This is  combinations '
 'which was the closest I could get to  This range barely breaks even versus '
 'our  Now ask yourself Is this a range you would expect your opponent to '
 'defend with versus  times  bet I know myself even as someone who professes '
 'to use this move I fold AJo a little too much in this spot Especially if the '
 'gentleman is a live player in his thirties I assume he is scared of getting '
 'his queens cracked or he thinks AKs is a drawing hand Even versus a good '
 'online player if we are playing with a  effective stack I feel stuck here I '
 'dont want to flat with  and I really do not want to  it I also do not want '
 'to do anything with',
 'the smaller pairs Im pulled in by the illusory charm of waiting for a better '
 'spot Diagram  The work I just did with writing and copyingpasting the photos '
 'took me less than  minutes If I had just been in my house showing you it '
 'would have taken three minutes But from now on we know if our opponent is '
 'opening about a third of the hands on the button remember what that range '
 'looks like and our  needs to work  of the time we can  to a large amount if '
 'we think they will not defend with the smaller pairs and mediocre suited '
 'aces Obviously we probably want to make our written rule a little more '
 'precise than that I suggest bullet points using as many precise details as '
 'possible This is a rule we should print out and take with us throughout the '
 'day If you memorize enough of these you can really stay out of trouble The '
 'pros wont be able to do much to exploit you because you will understand what '
 'your range needs to do while theyll be feeling their way into an answer you '
 'already know theyre unlikely to achieve By grasping this simple math you can '
 'solve for whether your  bluffs are correct or not I really suggest if youre '
 'an online player that you filter for every time you  with nothing and see if '
 'through hand range analysis your play is logically cleared Figure out the '
 'range your opponent defends with divide that number of combinations by the '
 'number he started with and see what percentage of the time he was folding If '
 'he was folding a higher percentage of the time than your play mathematically '
 'necessitated you could checkfold  of flops and still make money',
 'What if there are other players If you are  from the small blind you need to '
 'account for the big blind Say you make a  from the small blind which is to  '
 'The small blind was  Youre risking  to win  the amount in the pot including  '
 'You know instinctively that this needs to work around  of the time so you '
 'could just run with that in real time But for the sake of accuracy you open '
 'a calculator and figure it out  Suppose the button opener folds  of the time '
 'to  You look at his Raise First statistics and find that he raises the most '
 'from the button so logically you know that he has to have more garbage hands '
 'in his range So you have a  fold to  and youre more certain it will hold up '
 'because theyre opening so much crap Maybe to be safe and to account for the '
 'general suspicious nature people have when their button raise is  we make '
 'it  What do you think the big blind is playing versus a raise and a reraise '
 'If you think its  A Qo then your guy is playing  of the hands The button '
 'therefore has an estimated folding range of  or  The big blind has a folding '
 'range of  or  To get their combined folding range you would simply multiply '
 'the two   Both players are folding  of the time You needed them to fold  of '
 'the time to show a profit You could do this play with any two cards To '
 'extend this to more players estimate their hand range with Flopzilla and '
 'multiply the percentages of hands not played Youll quickly find out that it '
 'is not advisable to  much earlier than the cutoff because it is too likely '
 'someone wakes up with a strong hand The ace blocker Your opponents most '
 'likely  combinations will contain an ace The reason for this is simply '
 'mathematical There are  combinations of every twocard starting hand such as '
 'an AK There are only six combinations of every pair Therefore the majority '
 'of hand combinations that will be raised and jammed will be twocard '
 'combinations that contain an ace the highest card Removing an ace from the '
 'deck can block  or more of your opponents jamming combinations depending on '
 'the range you assign to him Having an ace in your hand is extremely valuable '
 'if your opponent is not keen on flatting  However if your opponent does like '
 'to flat  then you should be careful with Ax holdings as they can make a '
 'number of expensive second best hands Stack manipulation One way you can '
 'make sure your opponent is not flatting your  or  for that matter is by '
 'manipulating the stacks so he cannot do so An example I see frequently is '
 'when a player with  opens in the cutoff to  The player on the button also '
 'with  decides to  his typical amount  The blinds fold Well now the cutoff '
 'player has a wealth of options He can force the button to defend for all of '
 'his chips by  only  more making the total bet  blinds He will be risking an '
 'additional  to win almost twice that amount meaning his raise doesnt need to '
 'be successful more than  of the time Yet the button who was so eager to '
 'exploit his positional advantage now feels he needs to jam  in order to do '
 'anything about it You can argue that he could flat but the option isnt very '
 'attractive either especially if he doesnt',
 'have a read on his opponent What if the button made it  instead of  This '
 'play is not popular but mathematically there isnt much reason for that The '
 'blinds are going to come over the top of a raise like that very seldom The '
 'cutoff is stuck He cant flat and feel like he has great implied odds and '
 'any  will commit his  stack Youve more effectively checkmated him He has '
 'significantly fewer options Pay attention to what your opponent could do '
 'when your stack is vulnerable Try to turn the tables on him Cold  bluffing '
 'The cold  is one of the few plays that is not only stunningly underused but '
 'also misused The situations for it are few but the  or so it allows you to '
 'capture can make a huge difference Many people say the only way you can '
 'learn when to  bluff is by trial and error I disagree We could set up a '
 'number of hypothetical situations and learn from them instead of putting our '
 'own money and time at risk This is why when the middleaged players ask me if '
 'they have any chance in poker I give them an emphatic yes Lee Nelson was  '
 'years old when he started tearing up tournament poker I would argue that the '
 'amount of time he spent studying the game outside put him at that level way '
 'before experimental lessons would have taken him there Lets set up a likely '
 'situation where wed try a cold  We have Ax The other card doesnt matter '
 'because theres no chance were getting flatted and we have no intention to '
 'call a shove Player  opens from the cutoff with  He makes it  at our '
 'fictional   ante  players table Player  on the button makes it  on the '
 'button also with  We have them both covered We decide to make it  from the '
 'big blind We are risking  to win  which means our bet needs to work  of the '
 'time While the numbers might not be exact youre unlikely to be at too many  '
 'tables a similar situation will play itself out in many of your potential  '
 'bluffing spots How do we figure out if we should  here Well we take possible '
 'opening and  ranges and see where we can draw the line Then we write down '
 'what that line is and take it with us on our daily business Lets try one The '
 'original raiser is opening with  of hands This is why the button was  so '
 'much We see that the buttons overall  is normally  but its  when on the '
 'button Its very important to look at where someone likes to  as there are '
 'many favorite spots For example somebody who  a good deal might never do it '
 'from the button because theyre worried it looks too obvious For an estimate '
 'we say theyre   of the time in this situation How do we figure out if our  '
 'is going to work',
 'Diagram  First we take the  opener Diagram  In this instance although it '
 'isnt shown in the Diagram we have an ace blocker He has  opening '
 'combinations are possible if hes playing a very tough  opening range Now '
 'what do we think he is  jamming Were unlikely to have much of a sample of '
 'this particular situation Its a good idea to look at someones Fold to  '
 'statistic If someone generally respects  bets theyre far more likely to '
 'respect a cold  If they generally do not believe  they may assume that you '
 'believe the  must be picking on his obviously wide opening range meaning he '
 'expects you to cold  as a bluff some percentage of the time',
 'Diagram  Lets say this guy was fairly typical with a fold to  of  He knows '
 'youre a bit aggressive so he might widen his range a smidgen but hes not '
 'going nuts So lets say hes defending the range on the previous page Diagram  '
 'As we can see this is a terminator range I would not expect everyone to  AQo '
 'or  in this situation  of the time especially with so little invested in the '
 'pot but for the sake of argument lets say they are jamming this That means '
 'Player  on the cutoff is defending with  combinations out of  he started '
 'with   Player  is defending  of hands To simplify lets make this  That means '
 'he is folding  of the time',
 'Diagram  Player  on the button is   of the hands It is worth noting there '
 'are several ways to compose this  I have attempted to give Player  a more '
 'solid range than would normally be found in a bluffier  range so we can '
 'prepare for the worst Diagram  Note many people would flat  here but would   '
 'as a bluff We want more hands that could possibly be in our opponents  '
 'jamming range That helps us prepare for the worst so were including them Now '
 'this range starts with  combinations Hes going to be playing a much higher '
 'percentage of hands than Player  But how many Lets say he uses just the '
 'hands an aggressive and perceptive player would play Diagram ',
 'Diagram  Some would argue that this range is too wide They say that many '
 'people would not jam AJs Others would say you could include some other hands '
 'in your opponents jamming range The truth is that this range is already wide '
 'Were assuming Player  on the button is    of the time which is not likely '
 'the case Frequent  routinely flat hands they should be placing in their  '
 'range because they know they will be forced to play a large pot if anyone '
 'plays back at them They also usually  far more hands than they can '
 'profitably defend Our opponent is defending with  combinations out of  he '
 'started with That means he is defending   or  of the time For simplification '
 'lets say  of the time This means he is folding  of his hands Our first '
 'player was folding  of the time The two of them are folding    or  of the '
 'time Was this enough to justify our cold  No Recall we needed our  here to '
 'work  of the time However we also rounded up and gave our opponents the '
 'benefit of the doubt at every opportunity Were likely right at the breakeven '
 'point What we can derive from this is a note such as When initial raiser is '
 'opening  of the hands and reraiser is   of the time and neither has any '
 'special read a cold  with an ace blocker which cannot be flatted will work '
 'approximately  of the time',
 'Now whenever we see an inflated version of this we will know to attack Say '
 'the initial opener is playing  of the hands from the cutoff and the button '
 'is   of the time and we are in the big blind We will know to attack because '
 'its going to be extremely difficult for them to be defending enough hands '
 'Their ranges will need to be composed even more solidly unlikely and they '
 'will need to be defending a more grotesque amount of hands unlikely if the '
 'table has not been active and if we have a normal reputation More '
 'importantly we will know when to not  here Just because a guy is   of the '
 'time doesnt mean we can cold  especially if hes aware of how often he has '
 'been  and the initial opener is only playing  of the hands We can also see '
 'how difficult it will be to cold  with one or two players to act if our '
 'initial raiser and  are not playing insane ranges Should you continuation '
 'bet When I first started playing poker tournaments for a living it was a '
 'given to me that every tournament professional continuation bet too often It '
 'was a joke between my friends when we played our first live events Oh you '
 'know Every hand is me raising continuation betting and then giving up Not '
 'much I can do It wasnt until I spoke to an extremely talented Dutch '
 'professional that I realized the error of my ways Every time you '
 'continuation bet have a reason he told me The reason could be simple My '
 'opponents fold to continuation bet is higher than  for example is a great '
 'reason to continuation bet That indicates your opponent is fairly honest as '
 'its hard to fold more than  of the time and be floating or bluffing many '
 'continuation bets Also you miss the board in no limit holdem around two '
 'thirds of the time Our opponent seems to be folding seemingly every time '
 'that happens A good reason not to continuation bet was because you would not '
 'get value from anything Say you have KQo and the board is AKx rainbow Other '
 'than KJ and  a typical calling range isnt going to have many hands that can '
 'call you that you currently beat Youre already beaten by an ace and theres '
 'no other overcard that could come off so theres little risk in checking back '
 'Eventually the tide changed in nolimit holdem Especially in tournaments '
 'everyone began pot controlling seemingly everything Betting and then not '
 'knowing what to do was treated as career suicide Hands that once seemed '
 'perfectly fine to continuation bet and fold were now treated like the holy '
 'grail for their minimal showdown value Id often hear a player with AJo in '
 'position say I checked back the   twotone board because that smacks his big '
 'blind flatting range and I have showdown value with my acehigh They never '
 'seemed to describe what they were doing versus a turn bet or if they were '
 'even aware of how often the opponent led the turn Some would back up their '
 'check here by saying What do I get value from Am I really making a  hand '
 'fold Logically I encourage my students to take on this reasoning Before you '
 'bet you should always ask yourself whether youre betting for value or as a '
 'bluff Doing so will keep you from making many impulsive bets that just dont '
 'make sense I even encourage my students to record themselves playing while '
 'they narrate the hands theyre betting and why I make them start their '
 'sentences one of two ways I am value betting because ______ hands call me '
 'which I beat I am bluffing because ______ hands that beat mine are folding',
 'Youd be amazed by how often a player is sure they need to bet until they try '
 'to explain it There is something to be said for cashing out our equity The '
 'KQo on the AKx rainbow board is a safe check because not many cards can '
 'diminish its equity However a  on an  board does not have this luxury as '
 'seemingly everything is an overcard which could steal our equity AJ high on  '
 'is even worse to check back I knew there had to be a better way Fortunately '
 'there is Lets say we open K Q from the cutoff Our opponent a strong tight '
 'aggressive player with a Voluntarily put money in Preflop VPIP of  and '
 'Preflop Raise of  flats us from the button The board comes  rainbow with no '
 'clubs Should we continuation bet not having a backdoor flush draw overcard '
 'or anything Lets analyze We think hell respect a halfpot bet Quick how often '
 'does that need to work I hope you remembered  of the time This means our '
 'opponent will have to be defending  of their flatting range on this board '
 'Heres the Flopzilla analysis that I just cooked up Lets see if our opponent '
 'is defending that often Diagram  In that list next to the upper oval we have '
 'percentages of how often our opponents flatting range has each type of hand '
 'At the top we see he has a set  of the time At the bottom we see he has no '
 'made hand  of the time Diagram  Youll notice these numbers do not add up to  '
 'Thats because certain hands can belong to more than one range For example No '
 'Made Hand includes openended straight draws Flopzilla takes care not to '
 'count certain hands twice but instead wants to provide you a graphical '
 'representation of each range portion Youll notice in the upper oval a series '
 'of markers Those are how you categorize different parts of your opponents '
 'range I have put a filter next to every part of my opponents range that I '
 'assume he is defending Youll notice I put every pocket pair below top pair '
 'but above middle pair so hes calling with  Essentially my range only has him '
 'folding two undercard combinations and   and  Hes not folding often at all '
 'In the lower oval youll see what percentage this filtered range adds up to '
 'In this case it is ',
 'Recall he needed to be defending  of his hands to prevent us from profitably '
 'continuation betting with any two cards Knowing how to do this is extremely '
 'important because you will hear many people say unequivocally You cannot bet '
 'this board You can now produce Flopzilla and say Prove it If they cant its '
 'because they have never done this work themselves and theyre making the '
 'mistake of treating their gut instincts as facts Lets take another board '
 'same situation    Again complete brick no backdoor draw although now we do '
 'have two overcards Do you think we should continuation bet this board This '
 'is very similar to many boards where people go Oh this smacks his flatting '
 'range Diagram  Diagram  Youll notice in this example the hands we have '
 'filtered are barely defending enough to prevent us from continuation betting '
 'profitably However look what I have included We have our opponent playing '
 'any pair and any draw    and  all are calling He could also be calling with '
 'gutshot straight draws such as QJ but that actually helps your equity since '
 'currently you have that hand beat So we can deduce it would take a '
 'Terminator defender before our bet becomes unprofitable Against any normal '
 'opponent who wont play  on this board you should bet Considering if he flats '
 'you on this board his range is likely capped at one pair you should really '
 'bet as you have overcard draws to beat him and you could also bluff him on '
 'scarier turn and river cards What you end up finding is that on most board '
 'structures with some equity you can profitably continuation bet especially '
 'if your opponent is not spectacularly tricky You cant continuation bet when '
 'the flop is racked with aces and Broadway cards and you have undercards and '
 'pairs In addition you cant continuation bet when your opponent is on the '
 'tighter end of the flatting spectrum say when he smooth calls a UTG raise '
 'Nailing down the particulars is a matter of practice Against more than one '
 'player If you want to figure out how often your continuation bet is going to '
 'work versus multiple players the process is very similar to the other hands '
 'weve seen Filter what you believe their defending range is and deduce from '
 'that their folding range If your first opponent is defending  of his '
 'holdings then  is',
 'his folding range If your second opponent is defending  of his range then he '
 'folds  of his hands To get their combined folding range youd multiply  by  '
 'which would be reflected by  x   Yeah they both fold  of the time Thats on '
 'the tougher end of the spectrum but youre rarely getting two players to fold '
 'the required  of the time you need when you bet half the pot Whats the '
 'solution Bet smaller on fit or fold boards Also dont continuation bet in '
 'multiway pots without backdoor draws at the very least It also assists you '
 'greatly if you have a good idea as to what your opponents are doing on the '
 'turn Turn and river play Throwing out more barrels than donkey kong If you '
 'can learn to blind steal  bluff and cold  with efficiency you will be very '
 'hard to deal with in poker tournaments However if all you learn is to '
 'continuation bet most of the time youre heads up youll only be as postflop '
 'proficient as  of tournament grinders What really separates the men from the '
 'boys is their turn and river play This is where some work off the table is '
 'invaluable Lets say were in the same situation as the last section with the '
 'same tightaggressive opponent The board comes K   We have   but we know this '
 'board bricks our opponents flatting range enough that we can justify '
 'continuation betting We do so and he calls Is our plan to shut down Its '
 'important we pay attention to his Fold To Continuation Bet statistics on the '
 'flop and turn Many people are honest versus continuation bets on the flop '
 'because thats where they make their big decision They assume that if they '
 'flat on the flop they have to call down because additional barrels are '
 'always coming This persons statistics will be something like Fold To Flop '
 'Continuation Bet  Fold To Turn Continuation Bet  You should not blindly '
 'barrel against this guy Alternatively if our opponent never folds the flop '
 'and routinely folds the turn you know that is the street where he becomes '
 'honest His stats will be something like Fold To Flop Continuation Bet  Fold '
 'To Turn Continuation Bet  This means he likes to float but if you batter him '
 'with the second barrel he goes away Knowing these details drastically '
 'changes how you should approach different turn cards A  turn for example '
 'doesnt change much but thats fine if you have the person who floats a great '
 'deal The two certainly didnt make them a pair they feel great about You can '
 'fire and feel good about folding their various superior highcard holdings If '
 'you have the person who is honest versus the flop continuation bet however '
 'that  is an awful card You cant represent anything now Now lets try '
 'something We have a middleoftheroad player again our  tighter grinder He '
 'folds  of the time to flop continuation bets and  of the time to turn bets '
 'He likes to hold on a little more than the average regular because he tends '
 'to start with a better range of hands but he is not impervious to folding On '
 'this same board K   we see a J turn It gives us a gutshot but nothing else '
 'Should we double barrel If you dont know the answer to this one right away '
 'youre not alone Let me show you how you could solve for it starting with the '
 'flop Diagram  Our opponents range to the left has narrowed considerably '
 'Thats because I clicked on the circled',
 'button That froze our opponents range derived from the circled filters for '
 'analysis on the next card Youll notice that our filters are not over hands '
 'that are obviously playing versus us such as sets That is because this time '
 'we are not analysing whether our opponents defending range is weak enough to '
 'allow us to continuation bet regularly The continuation bet already failed '
 'We are moving to the turn What we are instead filtering for are hands that '
 'would just call versus our continuation bets I excluded sets and flush draws '
 'because our opponent generally plays those hands in an aggressive manner '
 'Remember he is tight and aggressive Once he gets a decent equity share on '
 'the flop he knows how to apply pressure and not allow draws to get there '
 'Diagram  Notice the little boxed filter next to the range portion weak pair '
 'This identifies that I edited the range To do this simply right click the '
 'section You can then delete hands you dont think will come along For this '
 'situation I had him calling with all the weak pairs that were better than a  '
 'but I deleted    and  assuming hed fold them I removed all the flush draws '
 'because that would help us with a turn double barrel If he flats with a '
 'bunch of his mediocre flush draws a missed draw on the turn helps us fire '
 'While its likely hed only raise with the nut flush draws and drawspair '
 'combinations I wanted us to have a tougher decision Now lets put another '
 'card down under the flop section This will enter the turn card and adjust '
 'the statistics on the right to reflect how his hand range has been changed '
 'Diagram  As you can see the J has drastically changed our opponents hand '
 'values He had a fairly strong flop calling range but now  of his hands are '
 'weak pairs What if hes not the type of guy to fold those hands to a double '
 'barrel Great question Given his fold to continuation bet on the turn is '
 'only  that is a valid concern',
 'Diagram  Remember that  was derived when people made typical turn '
 'continuation bets say  of the pot What do you think would happen if you bet '
 'say the size of the pot Quickly did you know how often that potsized bet '
 'would need to work Like your multiplication tables you should have known '
 'without thinking If you bet the size of the pot your bet must succeed  of '
 'the time If your opponent here calls with Q Q as Ive filtered for then he is '
 'only calling  of the time That means he is folding  of the time You have a '
 'meaty double barrel opportunity here In Flopzilla there is an option to lock '
 'the flop you had and then activate random turns This is a great way to '
 'practice for several situations at once Normally youd have to get into the '
 'same double barrel spot twice every few weeks and hope your memory is good '
 'enough to make some connection and eschew resultsorientated thinking This '
 'way you can practice the situation you had trouble with trying several turn '
 'cards and visualizing different bet sizes Keep notes on your findings What '
 'if Many times I show a hand like this and the next question I receive is '
 'what if somebody just really doesnt like folding to continuation bets Their '
 'Fold To Flop Continuation Bet is  and their Fold To Turn Continuation Bet '
 'is  Theoretically if he is playing a wide range of hands preflop your bet '
 'should be larger Many aggressive players are putting up a front They want to '
 'be perceived as aggressive and not weak They dont want to do anything that '
 'will make them look stupid Calling an overbet for no real reason is '
 'considered stupid by most poker players Overbets are not in fashion Most of '
 'the players who make overbets are trying to get serious value by overplaying '
 'a premium hand These aggressive players will consider you to be a '
 'straightforward player who is overplaying a premium hand and feel quite '
 'comfortable folding to it Alas if your opponent is not playing a normal '
 'range of hands preflop or seems to be particularly testy that day just check '
 'and fold One of the things that amazes my friends the most when they sweat '
 'me deep in large buyin events is',
 'how often a great player at my table will check and fold They dont put those '
 'hands on TV because theyre not particularly interesting but all those saved  '
 'continuation bets add up in the long run Giving up also shows maturity Many '
 'beginning players can never check and fold to an opponent because it insults '
 'their ego to concede a pot to another The guys who are actually out to '
 'profit realize that money saved is money earned The mythical triple barrel '
 'Try bluffing ten rivers in online poker and tell me how the experience went '
 'You back Yeah what a waste of time huh The problem with online tournament '
 'poker is that the river is not as threatening On the turn your opponent '
 'doesnt get to see your hand when they call and the hand isnt over They have '
 'to sweat a new card that could hurt their holding Additionally another bet '
 'could threaten their stack On the river none of this exists There are no '
 'more bets or cards to come that could screw things up for them Furthermore '
 'when they call they get to see your hand If they were really good at folding '
 'on rivers they probably wouldnt be playing nolimit holdem tournaments Given '
 'the choice of folding or investing a little more Monopoly money to win a '
 'great deal of Monopoly money and simultaneously satisfy their curiosity as '
 'to what exactly you were holding then unsurprisingly most of these folks '
 'elect to call As such I dont recommend a triple barrel very often unless the '
 'bet is an overbet or puts your opponent all in When his tournament life is '
 'on the line hes more likely to think of the call in terms of real money and '
 'time invested which may lead him to find the dusty fold button Theres also '
 'something logically holding back the success rate of your triple barrels '
 'Traditionally we barrel for a specific reason Our opponent has many possible '
 'hands but is only going to the next street with the strongest among those '
 'holdings Since there are so many weaker holdings we can bet knowing that '
 'only the cream of the crop is calling For this reason its often a great idea '
 'to bet the flop for the same reason its a horrible idea to bet the turn Your '
 'opponent is honest and folding too often he only continues with solid '
 'holdings which are unlikely to fold to another bet Weve seen in the previous '
 'section how we can alter bet sizes to produce a fold Weve also seen how '
 'certain turn cards could drastically change the values of our opponents flop '
 'calling range Yet when our opponents range has been put through a flop and '
 'turn strainer its usually less likely they have much they can fold on the '
 'river That doesnt mean we shouldnt triple barrel It just means that it is '
 'trickier One way we can set up a triple barrel is by betting small on the '
 'turn to set up a river shove The real money and time investment of the '
 'tournament comes to mind when their tournament life is at stake The small '
 'bet allows them to see the river with too many weak hands without a plan '
 'Also this is a great tactic if a number of river cards help our triple '
 'barreling range To find out what those cards are we can do the same thing we '
 'just did for the turn in Flopzilla In the example weve been working with '
 'lets pretend we only bet  of the pot on the turn We were playing too many '
 'tables and were on autopilot This bet is not advisable for reasons weve '
 'already discussed and because few river cards greatly affect our perceived '
 'range However in our example of letting an expanded range of our opponents '
 'hands carry through we bet halfpot and they called with anything better than '
 'third pair This is reflected as follows Diagram ',
 'Diagram  You can see what is calling in our opponents range Now lets add the '
 'one overcard which could save our ass the almighty ace Diagram  Now our '
 'opponents range is in tatters A full  of it is a weak pair What is a weak '
 'pair That is third pair or worse To give you an idea of how broadly you can '
 'bluff imagine you bet  times the size of the pot In a pot of  you apply  of '
 'pressure Youre risking  to win    Your bet would need to work  of the time '
 'as a pure bluff in order to show a profit If our opponent is going to fold '
 'third pair or worse on this river he will be folding  of the time You will '
 'have a  edge Certainly this is enough to make a play chipEV profitable but '
 'perhaps not enough to make us shove considering ICM equations Yet if our '
 'opponent is also going to fold a king he will be folding  of the time You '
 'now have a  edge if you shove for  the size of the pot Of course smaller '
 'bets can be just as effective and wont require nearly as high of a folding '
 'percentage',
 'Diagram  This is where the math becomes especially interesting in nolimit '
 'holdem So many people would never try a bet  times the size of the pot '
 'because it feels so gross when you lose and have to show a bluff We however '
 'are going to adhere to logic not what the peanut gallery will yell at us '
 'Thats a checkraise fool Three years ago I was teaching for a larger backing '
 'house at a camp of theirs Theyd flown players from around the world to '
 'receive poker instruction from me and one of my friends for a week The kids '
 'were great but one instance really made them lose their mind Near the end of '
 'the camp I played a session on a big screen for them They were aghast at how '
 'often I flatted from the big blind I would never do that they exclaimed Then '
 'when they saw me check folding some bottom pairs they looked like they were '
 'going to go into cardiac arrest In todays environment its much more popular '
 'for people to flat from the big blind This worries some as the game has '
 'changed and they dont know how to react I addressed in a previous section '
 'why its actually free money people flat miss the board  of the time and then '
 'fold Were in  again To avoid being one of these people you need to develop a '
 'competent checkraise bluffing game One of the first things you should look '
 'for when planning a checkraise is the persons stack size Imagine what their '
 'continuation bet will look like coming from their stack If you checkraise '
 'will the person have room to flat you allowing them to see the turn Will '
 'they be able to  bluff you should they get suspicious If they cant do any of '
 'these things then youve put them in a very tricky position They will need to '
 'move allin in order to catch your bluff Many people dont have it in them to '
 'turn over a high card when all the chips go in The stacks I recommend to '
 'checkraise are typically around  If they have less than that it can work as '
 'well In fact your checkraise wont have to be as large so it will '
 'mathematically need to succeed a smaller percentage of the time However one '
 'should be careful when trying to use a check raise on these smaller stacks '
 'When someone puts in a greater percentage of their chips they are more '
 'likely to say screw it and pop in the rest of them You wont be making nearly '
 'as many underpairs fold You can also do a checkraise bluff on larger stacks '
 'but you might want to make your checkraises larger Most people size their '
 'checkraises somewhere around  their opponents continuation bet Out of '
 'position this is an insult Its saying I know you have nothing and Im going '
 'to give you an incredible price to  or float because I know you wont do '
 'anything with it Obviously this injures some mens egos Its better to make it '
 'closer to the size of the pot Then your checkraise is absurd and youre the '
 'idiot They dont lose face folding and remember a potsized checkraise only '
 'needs to work  of the time If you pick your boards correctly youll know they '
 'have no pair and no draw  of the time What boards should we checkraise When '
 'people start trying to develop a checkraise bluffing game they try to bluff '
 'boards that are very hit or miss Say they and their opponent are  deep Their '
 'opponent opens from the cutoff with  of their hands He raises to  Our hero '
 'flats from the big blind with   after everyone else folds The pot is now  '
 'The board comes Q Q  Weve missed but this looks like a very hard board for '
 'our opponent to hit as well Yet how can we know for sure how often our '
 'opponent hit the board Lets input everything on Flopzilla Diagram ',
 'Under the statistics column Ive placed a filter next to every hand of our '
 'opponents that is better than AK high as marked by overcards Youll notice '
 'that only  of the time our opponent has AK high or better That means  of the '
 'time he has no pair and no more than three overcard outs It looks like a '
 'great flop We check and villain on the cutoff bets  Delighted we make it  '
 'Take that Diagram  The problem is if our opponent is a thinking player and '
 'most of them are thinking players now hes going to wonder what you have You '
 'have an even weaker range than he does His opening range could still contain '
 'bigger pairs Since you just called preflop its less likely you have those '
 'holdings If you hit trips on this board with a queen what are you '
 'necessarily getting value from You have the deck crippled You might get '
 'value from a smaller pair right now but will you get more on the turn '
 'Furthermore if you had  or  you might be worried about building a pot versus '
 'a superior queen Normally people with a queen here just flat and many of '
 'your opponents will know this They know that almost  of their range is pure '
 'air Youd want that weak range to keep barreling and youd want to control the '
 'damage versus a superior queen In short its very hard to sell a queen in '
 'this spot So your opponent makes it  putting it right back on you Hes '
 'risking  to win    His bet here needs to work  of the time Thats not too '
 'often Hes gambling that  of the time or more youre going to fold This is '
 'actually a great idea because there are only two queens left in the deck and '
 'logically its difficult to give you one of them Also its unlikely youll  '
 'bluff considering that will require you to put in more than half of your '
 'chips That is certainly feasible You wont have to worry about what kind of '
 'price youll be getting if your opponent shoves because you will have  equity '
 'in the pot However many guys dont have that kind of  bluff in them Also ICM '
 'would imply that the chips were risking here are more valuable than the '
 'chips we stand to win Well lose a good deal of our maneuverability in the '
 'tournament if we go down to a short stack If instead what if we were to make '
 'it  on the flop versus our opponents  continuation bet Wed be risking  to '
 'win the  in the pot That means our bet needs to work   or  of the time '
 'Remember our opponent doesnt have AK high or better  of the time Youre '
 'clearing a profit now if he folds those hands',
 'Will he do that Well if he thought about your bet for a while hed be '
 'suspicious Who really check raises to more than the size of the pot with a '
 'queen However Id wager my house that most people who see these gratuitously '
 'sized bets dont think All right awesome spot to  more than half of my chips '
 'If their backer or friends see them doing that theyll probably yell You '
 'idiot Obviously hes some casual player who is afraid his slow played aces or '
 'his random queen is going to get sucked out on Most people think this '
 'checkraise is weird and suspicious but they are certainly not going to do '
 'anything about it If they fold anything that isnt a pair that means theyll '
 'be folding  of the time That assumes hes getting it in with  which doesnt '
 'seem all that likely either Of course if we were playing against Jonathan '
 'Little we wouldnt make it  here A talented player of his caliber is more '
 'likely to see through our ploy Versus him we could make it  If he knows we '
 'know a good deal about poker hes unlikely to think were doing that as a '
 'bluff because the counter play is so easy to execute Well arouse enough '
 'suspicion to satisfy our bluff ratio Now lets pretend a different board came '
 'out Q   Diagram  If we checkraise this board we can represent a far wider '
 'range of hands We could be fastplaying a queen attempting to get value from '
 'flush draws We could be fastplaying a flush draw with an overcard A set is '
 'likely to checkraise because of the flush draw on board although as you can '
 'see our opponent has a flush draw less than a tenth of a time While its '
 'considered the normal play to checkraise to get value from flush draws '
 'perhaps we should rethink how often we use that play Diagram  Furthermore '
 'look at our opponents range Only  of the time does he have a six or better '
 'on this board If we checkraise a larger amount its very difficult for him to '
 'do anything about it Most guys dont have it in them to call down with  or '
 'worse If he happens to get testy a number of cards help us on the turn Any '
 'seven or nine will outdraw his second pairs A club or an eight will give us '
 'significant drawing equity That gives us a nice discount on how often our '
 'bluff needs to work if we decide to barrel again on the turn Chicken board '
 'considerations',
 'Ive never really said this term out loud but in my mind Ive always '
 'considered boards like  or K  rainbow boards to be chicken boards If we '
 'checkraise them were not really representing anything Were saying I dare you '
 'to do something about this Were gambling on our opponent not being able to '
 'do that There are times when this is a good idea One time is when the stacks '
 'are so short that our opponent will need to move allin to prove you wrong '
 'Since he will have to turn his hand face up if he gets caught many guys '
 'arent willing to shove with acehigh or worse This is a good litmus test for '
 'whether you can bluff one of these chicken boards what does the guy need to '
 'jam Many people will be quick to discredit your checkraise bluff by asking '
 'What are you representing The better question is What is he going to have to '
 'do if he wants to do something about it The way to figure this out is to '
 'look at how often your bet needs to work and take the remainder So if your '
 'checkraise bluff needs to work mathematically  of the time then your '
 'opponent needs to defend with at least  of his continuation betting range '
 'Group the hands under the statistic portion of Flopzilla until youve come up '
 'with  of the hands Youll then see what he needs to jam or call with in order '
 'to profitably negate your checkraise What youll frequently discover is that '
 'they will need to shove hands such as acehigh If your opponent doesnt have '
 'it in him to shove bottom pair or a high card you really dont have to worry '
 'about how unbelievable your checkraise is Another time its a good idea to '
 'checkraise chicken boards is when you know your opponent is a pot controller '
 'I was headsup yesterday versus a Belgian pro I had in my notes that he liked '
 'to pot control a good deal of the time In fact it seemed like his greatest '
 'worry in life was having to betfold a pair So whenever the flop came  '
 'rainbow and he continuation bet I laughed What was he hoping to represent '
 'now Hed check back most aces Hes at the tip top of his range prepared to '
 'stack off or he has nothing and theres much more nothing than sets in this '
 'range I checkraised even though I knew I wasnt representing anything '
 'because  of the time I knew Id catch him with two undercards and no matter '
 'what price he had on a  bluff or float he wasnt going to do it Thats another '
 'key component You need to know your opponent doesnt get out of line Many '
 'guys make all their money playing a thoughtful but careful game If you '
 'continue to put them in spots where theyre not comfortable you will continue '
 'to see them mash the fold button Statistics to look for Of course in all of '
 'this analysis were assuming our opponent continuation bets with the entirety '
 'of his range Many people who discover this go Oh this is all hypothetical '
 'then I cant use this against any real opponent If you want an excuse to keep '
 'playing a boring game go ahead run with that The truth is that giving this '
 'guy the entirety of his range is actually pretty generous In the words of a '
 'Russian friend of mine Usually a players checking range is stronger than '
 'their betting range That is absolutely correct If a player has nothing its '
 'odd to see him not take a shot when youve just completed from the big blind '
 'and have then checked out of position If he has a pair he wants to pot '
 'control with hes far more likely to check with that Many of the Flopzilla '
 'analyses we used had our opponent betjamming bottom pair with no checking '
 'back of any pairs His continuation bet becomes markedly weaker if we add in '
 'some pot controlled pairs Most of the time when you play  nolimit or higher '
 'online youll notice that peoples continuation bet percentages rest around  '
 'This is because the experience required to make it in those stakes requires '
 'you develop a balanced continuation bet range These people are betting one '
 'third of the time',
 'requires you develop a balanced continuation bet range These people are '
 'betting one third of the time with a strong hand and one third of the time '
 'without one Additionally one third of the time they check',
 'balancing missed hands and solid holdings That is an extremely difficult '
 'continuation betting range to crack What you wont see often at those stakes '
 'is someone with a continuation bet of  or higher They would be murdered Why '
 'You only hit the board  of the time Assuming they bet every single time they '
 'hit that means they only have a made hand in their continuation betting '
 'range  of the time by virtue of   That means  of the time theyre betting zip '
 'and pip This is an easy range to exploit This is not to say that betting  of '
 'the time is necessarily a bad idea If no one is going to check raise to '
 'exploit you or flat you out of position it can be a great idea Theres even '
 'less incentive to check back a hand in tournaments Your stacks often rest '
 'around  which means picking up draws and the like on the turn do much less '
 'for you You simply wont win much money when you create a concealed hand '
 'because the implied odds arent there Ask yourself this question if someone '
 'sees you completing from the big blind and then checking do you think they '
 'continuation bet more or less than average They continuation bet more '
 'generally They assume since you didnt  that you cant have as strong of a '
 'range Since you only completed from the big blind they know youre playing '
 'more crap hands than usual Versus that weaker range and considering there '
 'are considerable chips in the pot they logically put in a continuation bet '
 'These are the people you can take advantage of Look for that high '
 'continuation bet percentage and attack Dont double barrel In general dont '
 'double barrel when a checkraise goes awry I gave one example previously of '
 'when we could have picked up equity on the turn This will help a more '
 'professional player who can ascertain if the player flatted the flop in '
 'frustration For most beginners this is a dangerous proposition Your job '
 'while youre learning is to pick boards where your opponent is continuation '
 'betting practically all of his garbage and only holding on with his good '
 'pairs That person is betfolding enough to make your play profitable That '
 'person is also extremely difficult to double barrel bluff without any '
 'additional equity because he is only continuing versus your checkraise with '
 'the top of his range The journey begins I began teaching because I had '
 'squandered a very large bankroll playing too high and backing every single '
 'one of my friends I didnt want to teach it was what I had to do Now one of '
 'my favorite things in the world to do is teach poker I cant believe it '
 'actually makes me the money that it does It almost seems unfair Not only do '
 'I get to research a game I love with new friends but educational exploration '
 'constantly reinvigorates my passion for the game When I got into poker '
 'coaching I couldnt believe how many peoples games had been ruined by '
 'careless suggestions It might be a good idea for a savant to  practically '
 'every button but its a high risk play which shouldnt be used heedlessly by '
 'amateurs It might be a good idea for the pro to float with practically '
 'anything on seemingly every flop but its a short trip to ruin for most of us '
 'There was too much focus in poker literature and videos on fancy plays It '
 'was impressive and fun to',
 'consume but it didnt teach much of anything I wanted to give my students a '
 'foundation At first they were disheartened to find out that initially they '
 'wouldnt be able to do the freakish plays they saw on TV But then they '
 'started playing Repeatedly whether it is on the live felt at their local '
 'casino or clicking buttons on their favorite poker site they were chipping '
 'up They were cashing more Soon they started taking down more tournaments One '
 'made it into the top five of the Pocketfives rankings and stayed there for '
 'years Another captured the second largest Triple Crown in history taking '
 'down three major tournaments in the span of a week While these results were '
 'extraordinary they were not unexpected Among hundreds of students youre apt '
 'to find a few standout pupils What was more interesting were the senior '
 'citizens who started taking down their local tournament practically weekly '
 'Pros who had been stagnating for years began to show new purpose They all '
 'had the same thing to say The fancy plays were overused and unfairly praised '
 'Real money could be made sticking to what should have always been the basics '
 'Once they were mastered and only then were the ethereal plays more '
 'accessible and understandable What Ive described in this chapter are hard '
 'line facts to get you ahead of many lazier opponents It is my firm belief '
 'that I have put too much information in this short chapter on poker If you '
 'reread through it and master the methods I taught in these pages you will be '
 'a force to be reckoned with in nolimit tournaments Better yet no real card '
 'sense is required I know its not Im walking proof Furthermore the methods of '
 'play deconstruction taught here can be grafted onto more complex plays Much '
 'of the information to continue can be found for free online Read the '
 'instruction manuals and forums dedicated to the specific instruments and '
 'practices weve detailed in this chapter Save hand histories where you tried '
 'plays not described here Make your own attempt to construct what should and '
 'should not be done Whatever you do do not trust those who teach without '
 'evidence unless they are extremely consistent winning players The technique '

 'me to teach privately While Id prefer to be there walking you through each '
 'process along with hand histories I thank Jonathan Little for giving me the '

 ' SHORT STACK STRATEGIES OLD SCHOOL VERSUS NEW SCHOOL Introduction With the '
 'arrival of internet poker on a global scale in  came many new interesting '
 'mathematical solutions for nolimit Holdem With these gleaming new theories '
 'in their arsenal many of the new school players who came primarily from the '
 'internet began to win the worlds biggest poker tournaments But was this '
 'entirely due to the sheer number of new school players There are  or more '
 'new school players versus  old school players Although the old school '
 'players add up to less than  percent of the total players in the game it '
 'would be a big mistake to think that the gigantic number of new school '
 'players is the only explanation for their disproportionate success There are '
 'many great new school players who will stand the test of time and there are '
 'many great new school theories that are so good they have already altered '
 'the tournament poker landscape forever In this chapter I am going to focus '
 'on one such theory the short stack theory developed by the new school I have '
 'asked Liv Boeree to represent the new school Liv will help me examine the '
 'differences between my own short stack approach which has served me well '
 'since  and the new school theories A short stack is considered a stack '
 'containing  or less Context will be needed so Liv and I will compare and '
 'contrast these theories both in online and live tournaments The  stack To '
 'me  does not seem short After all you can fold two rounds in a row a whole  '
 'hands and lose only  to  depending on whether or not there is an ante each '
 'hand But the new school theory has rules for a  stack based on playing '
 'countless online tournaments According to Liv these are the rules Your '
 'opening ranges become tighter than before You can rarely call  with this '
 'stack size and therefore you should avoid opening speculative hands such as '
 'suited connectors unless your table is particularly passive Bet sizing both '
 'preflop and especially postflop should be smaller eg  instead of your usual  '
 'bet This is to give you more maneuverability when you have value hands you '
 'can still easily get your entire stack in by the river and because your '
 'opponent knows this too it allows you to make cheaper believable bluffs  '
 'shoving over a raise in late position becomes an option Its impossible to '
 'give predefined',
 'shoving ranges as it is always dependent on your situation Fortunately there '
 'are a number of equity calculators that can help you deduce a correct '
 'shoving range A particularly good site is wwwholdemresourcesnet which '
 'includes some free and purchasable calculation software You can of course '
 'still call preflop raises with hands as you would with a deeper stack It '
 'just becomes much more important to consider the postflop playability of '
 'your hand For example if you are on the button and facing a raise from the '
 'cutoff small pairs should be shoved as they have strong preflop value and '
 'your stack is too shallow to allow for set mining However you can still call '
 'with a hand like KJ or Q J because it often dominates the cutoffs holding '
 'and plays well postflop Depending on ICM it may become correct to open shove '
 'some hands to force your opponents to fold almost everything such as when '
 'you are close to a money bubble Again ICM calculators can help you work out '
 'exactly whenif you should be shoving I love Livs new school rules except one '
 'Personally Im not keen on shoving  with a small pair when faced with a raise '
 'from the cutoff To me whether or not I would make this allin move is '
 'completely read dependent If I read my opponent to be weak then I would pull '
 'the trigger and move all in with a small pair If I read my opponent to be '
 'super strong then I might call a  raise and set mine or I may opt to fold '
 'right there and then However if Im facing an opponent on the internet then I '
 'would more often than not move allin The only time I wouldnt move allin is '
 'if I have noticed that my opponent has been playing really tight in which '
 'case I would suspect that he is a lot more likely to have a hand that he '
 'could call me with Example   The blinds are  you are on the button with   '
 'You have  and everyone has folded to you What do you do Phil I would raise '
 'it up to   and hope that both players in the blinds fold If either player in '
 'the blinds opted to move allin then I would fold Liv Normally I would raise '
 'to   which is my usual raise size with all hands during the middle and late '
 'stages of a tournament This is because a minraise usually achieves the same '
 'as a  raise when the average stack is shallower and its important to '
 'maintain maneuverability Furthermore since Im only raising to  I lose less '
 'of my stack if I have to fold to an opponents reraise However Phils bigger '
 'raise size has some merit if the players in the blinds are loosepassive We '
 'want to avoid players defending a wide range of overcards versus our small '
 'pair and forcing us to make difficult decisions postflop for our entire '
 'stack If the blinds are especially aggressive I often raise with the '
 'intention of calling a jam This is because there are some hands in their '
 'shoving range that we dominate such as   and a substantial number of hands '
 'were flipping against Alternatively you can profitably open shove the button '
 'if you know theyre very aggressive and dont fancy the variance Example   '
 'With eight players remaining playing two  tables in the World Series of '
 'Poker WSOP ',
 ' buyin NoLimit Holdem  Tournament sixtime WSOP bracelet winner Layne Flack '
 'was on the button After Greg Merson folded the cutoff Layne looked down at  '
 'with a stack of   with the blinds at  Layne raised to  thinking that he had '
 'a tight table image and that  would have the same effect as a  raise Layne '
 'likes a minraise because it gives him more maneuverability The player in the '
 'small blind reraised to  Layne thought for a moment and then he decided that '
 'a  stack played roughly the same as a  stack and thus he opted to call The '
 'flop was  the player in the small blind moved allin and Layne called '
 'doubling up versus his opponents  Phil Although I would have opened for  I '
 'like Laynes logic he had a tight image and I dont mind his minraise to  '
 'However I would have folded to the  reraise I dont think that  is the best '
 'hand very often and its not easy to hit that hand hard Too often you will '
 'flop nothing and bluffing is not much of an option with a short stack '
 'against aggressive players and be forced to fold on the flop And then when '
 'you do hit for example when it comes  you could easily be in bad shape for '
 'the rest of your stack Personally Im looking to conserve my chips and save '
 'them for a better spot As for the player in the small blind I would have '
 'made a read and if I sensed weakness then I would have made a much bigger '
 'reraise perhaps to  more to go  total I do not want to get called and for '
 'that reason my reraise sizing is bigger than the new school standards If my '
 'read is right then I want to force the issue and make my opponent fold power '
 'poker Liv Obviously it is very tempting to call and see a flop due to the  '
 'being small allowing us to see a relatively cheap flop  offsuit is just too '
 'weak but  suited is very close depending on how many bluffs the reraiser has '
 'in his range the minimum hand I would see a flop with is somewhere around J  '
 'Laynes point about a  stack being worth around the same amount as a  stack '
 'raises an interesting question is calling and seeing a flop in this '
 'situation more or less profitable than getting one free orbit of hands In '
 'this exact example where we are right at the bottom of our calling range we '
 'have to make our decision based upon the range and playing ability of the '
 'small blind If they are likely to be raising a range that mostly dominates '
 'our hand or are especially skilled postflop then we should lean towards '
 'folding Example   Heres an example featuring postflop play with this stack '
 'size Its folded around to us on the button with   with an  stack in a  '
 'midstakes online tournament The blinds are  The players in the blinds are '
 'reasonably tight and they both have us covered What should we do Liv We '
 'could make an argument for going allin as according to the equity '
 'calculator  offsuit is exactly a breakeven shove in this spot If your '
 'opponents are very aggressive we lean towards making this play however in '
 'this example the hand is playable enough against these opponents to make a '
 'small raise to  We do so and the big blind calls The flop is J   and the big '
 'blind checks to us Do we bet and if so how much We have flopped some equity '
 'with a number of turns that can improve our hand or give the perception',
 'of our hand improving As such our plan here is to bet small to maintain '
 'stack maneuverability for reasons discussed previously We bet around   into '
 'the  pot Villain calls The turn is the J   Q and he checks again This is a '
 'good card for our range In addition to our flop value hands we conceivably '
 'have a number of   and  hands with which we would continuation bet It also '
 'allows us to apply pressure to any one pair hands that our opponent most '
 'likely flopped The pot is now  how much should we bet We have  left in our '
 'stack and we want to ensure we have enough chips to make a sizable river '
 'shove We bet around  of the pot  Villain calls At this point Villains range '
 'of hands is mostly one pair hands such as Jx    or  He still has a few two '
 'pair hands but there arent many combinations of those especially as the '
 'weaker two pairs would have likely checkraised by this point He could also '
 'have a few combinations of  that he just called preflop called postflop '
 'because our bet was small and has now turned some more equity The river is '
 'the J   Q  Villain checks Do we go allin The pot is  and we have  left in '
 'our stack which is big enough to make any reasonable thinking opponent fold '
 'one pair His range has very few straights and flushes  would have likely '
 'checkraised the flop or turn and our  blocks a number of flush combinations '
 'he could have Meanwhile our range can still have rivered straights and '
 'flushes some two pairs top pair and not that many bluffs Therefore this is a '
 'good spot to go allin and we will likely win a healthy pot Phil If Im '
 'playing super tight poker like I usually do then I would either fold the '
 'hand preflop or open for   I would make my decision as to whether or not I '
 'raise or fold based on how often I have opened pots in the last  minutes do '
 'my opponents think Im playing super tight If I have indeed folded a high '
 'percentage of hands over the last  minutes then I would raise it to  My '
 'thinking here is that I want to give my super tight image a chance to win '
 'some much needed chips risk free Also opening for  gives me a better chance '
 'to induce both blinds to fold preflop compared to opening for  Assuming that '
 'I did open for  and that I was called preflop then I think that putting a '
 'bet in on the flop after my opponent checks is reasonable I also think that '
 'checking behind on the flop is a reasonable but slightly weaker play I '
 'prefer a flop bet of about  of the pot size as it gives me and my tight '
 'image another chance to win the pot Assuming that my  bet is called on the '
 'flop I would check on the turn and take a free card I am reasoning that I '
 'only have  left after betting  and  and there is  in the pot Thus my ability '
 'to bluff the next two streets is diminished Plus I think that most online '
 'players will call a  allin bet into a  pot if they have a marginal hand such '
 'as a pair of sevens in this spot I dont mind giving up here after running '
 'into resistance both preflop and on the flop Of course I can always hit my '
 'straight with a queen or an eight or I could hit a pair of tens or nines In '
 'the case of hitting a pair of tens or nines on the river and my opponent '
 'checking to me then I would value bet the river If my opponent did check to '
 'me on the river after the  hit I would probably give up and check back I '
 'hate to surrender but I feel like my opponent would call me with as a weak a '
 'hand as even a lowly pair of fives Sometimes discretion is the better part '
 'of valor The  stack',
 'Phil At  to me its starting to feel like I have a short stack However at the '
 'WSOP I start each nolimit holdem tournament four to six hours late so Im '
 'quite used to a  stack Liv and I are in agreement that you have play even '
 'tighter before the flop with this stack size The key question is this is '
 'there room to raise before the flop with the intention of folding to a '
 'reraise Liv Yes you can definitely still raise and fold with this stack '
 'especially if you are following my rule of using small raise sizes You '
 'should always be looking for good spots to steal the blinds and antes to '
 'keep yourself afloat The biggest difference with a  stack is that you can no '
 'longer profitably call preflop raises with Broadway type hands as you could '
 'with  unless youre in the big blind where it often only costs  to see a flop '
 'Another point is you can widen the range of hands that you  shove with This '
 'is because the win of approximately  blinds antes the opponents raise is a '
 'much bigger percentage increase to your stack than when you had  Lastly you '
 'are now able to open shove a wider range of hands in late position For '
 'example it is perfectly profitable to open shove KQ from the cutoff as '
 'opposed to raising with the intention of either calling or folding versus a '
 'reraise depending on opponent type Again this is because winning the blinds '
 'antes is worth so much more to your stack Example   Phil In a WSOP event in  '
 'I had  with the blinds at  The small blind moved allin for  and I looked '
 'down at  offsuit I knew the new school math said I had to call but a quick '
 'glance at the tournament clock told me there were  seconds left until a  '
 'minute break so I decided to take some extra time and use my best weapon my '
 'reading ability Thus I started a conversation with my opponent Without '
 'revealing my exact hole cards I told him that I had a hand that I was '
 'supposed to snap call with and that if he had  he was in bad shape Then I '
 'searched for a reaction that would help me determine the strength of his '
 'hand Was he scared Was he relieved After two or three minutes of studying '
 'and chatting he seemed very confident and it seemed like he was trying to '
 'talk me into calling him My read told me that he had AQ Thus I felt like he '
 'had me in bad shape and I went with my read and folded Although he did not '
 'show me his hole cards he was super disappointed and emotional and I could '
 'tell he had me crushed Also I was  sure that he would have shown me a bluff '
 'In this spot I knew the math but I wanted to give myself a chance to use '
 'some of my white magic reading ability to get away from a hand that almost '
 'no one else could get away from Liv I cant argue with your reading skills '
 'there Phil However as you said without very strong live reads you have to '
 'call This is because we have to think of the range of hands an average '
 'player in the small blind is shoving with  Hes most likely shoving all Ax   '
 'most Broadways a number of suited connectors like  and all pocket pairs '
 'Further its very likely that many of his really strong hands that dominate '
 'our  such as AK AQ  are often just raised  to induce some action from you '
 'Therefore we are miles ahead of his shoving range and should be happy with '
 'our call',
 'whatever the outcome Example   David Doc Sands a new school cream of the '
 'crop professional poker player was down to three players in the Los Angeles '
 'Poker Classic LAPC WPT  against new school top pro Dan Kelly and amateur '
 'Sean Jazayeri Sands was sitting on  million Jazayeri had  million and Kelly '
 'had  million with the blinds at  when Doc raised it up to  with  on the '
 'button Sean folded and Kelly moved allin for  million Sands says he was '
 'raising roughly  of the time he had the button thus he had a loose image and '
 'it was easy for opponents to put him on a wide range of hands Sands reasoned '
 'that for an investment of  million in chips he could win a  million pot and '
 'thus needed to win the pot  of the time to make the call breakeven He '
 'further reasoned that if he was  versus Kellys range then he should make the '
 'call Sands further reasoned that this was a good opportunity for him to take '
 'out a great player and face an amateur headsup for a WPT title and the  '
 'million first prize Sands further explained that he would have snap called '
 'with  called fairly quickly with  but that  was close With the added bonus '
 'of taking out a great player Sands opted to make the call Kelly had KJ and '
 'when Sands  held up he faced Jazayeri headsup for the title and the cash '
 'Phil Im not in love with Docs call here That being said I dont hate it '
 'either I understand that the reasoning and the logic are pure but when faced '
 'with similar situations in the past I have usually opted to fold There are '
 'two reasons I would have folded Firstly I hate to call off with a hand like  '
 'where the best case scenario is that I have a roughly  chance to win the pot '
 'After all I worked hard for several days to accumulate chips and make it to '
 'the final three players Secondly rather than call off  million of my chips '
 'off with  I always feel like a better spot will come along soon I would '
 'rather use my reading abilities to sniff out a spot where I know my '
 'opponents are weak This mindset that I have detailed assumes that I have '
 'serious skills and that I possess white magic level reading abilities So the '
 'question for the reader to ponder is this do I have the same skill set as '
 'Phil Hellmuth or do I hope to have the same skill set soon If you do not '
 'have that skill set then the call is probably better as there may not be a '
 'better spot in the near future If you hope to reach my skill set level then '
 'keep in mind my reasoning in this hand and someday soon you may be able to '
 'confidently fold in this spot Liv Sadly most of us mortals havent got the '
 'white magic you speak of Phil so we have to go on the pure mathematics of '
 'the situation As Doc correctly states the pot odds require him to call with '
 'a hand that has  equity versus Kellys reshoving range Again we can use one '
 'of the equity calculators I mentioned earlier in the chapter to work this '
 'out by inputting Kellys estimated  shoving hands Ive displayed them in the '
 'figure below',
 'Ive assumed that hes  shoving only a tight range consisting of almost all Ax '
 'all pairs and most of the Broadways Ive added  suited to cover the '
 'occasional times he chooses to shove a suited Kx or Qx Note that Ive assumed '
 'he just defends most of the suited Broadways and connectors such as  QJs '
 'and  because of their playability postflop so Ive excluded them I then ran '
 'the equity calculator and it determined Docs  has  equity versus this range '
 'making it a slightly favorable call Remember however that this example is '
 'versus a tight range and that Kellys actual range may be a bit wider than '
 'this which makes the call even more favorable So well done Doc and yay for '
 'math The  stack Phil At  Im finally feeling like a short stack When I '
 'entered the poker tournament world in the mid  I watched with great interest '
 'as Frank Henderson played his short stacks in an extraordinarily tight '
 'manner Most other poker players of that generation gave up when they became '
 'short and just pushed all of their chips in quickly in marginal spots trying '
 'to Get busy livin or get busy dyin from the movie Shawshank Redemption But '
 'Franks fight to the last breath strategy yielded a ton of comebacks I '
 'watched with amazement and respect as Frank on a short stack was super hard '
 'to knock out This led me to adopt the strategy of playing super tight when I '
 'had a short stack and I believe that it has been a major',
 'contributor to my successes A  key distinction Phil If everyone folds to you '
 'on the button can you open with  for  and then fold to a reraise I say yes '
 'The new school says you have to move allin before the flop In  one of the '
 'leaders of the new school Shaun Deeb changed his philosophy and agreed with '
 'me and it served him well as he had a big run in a series of high stakes '
 'online poker tournaments Liv To answer your question about opening  for  '
 'with the intention to fold to a reraise I really dont like it for a couple '
 'of reasons Firstly it means we are assuming that the blinds are very tight '
 'and only rejamming very few hands or alternatively it means they havent '
 'figured out that youre minraising hands like  with the intention of folding '
 'As soon as they notice that youre prepared to raisefold with that stack size '
 'theyll correctly widen their shoving range massively Running the numbers in '
 'an equity calculator if we give you a button raisefolding range of   and  '
 'and a raisecalling range  and AK I expect you would be openshoving all Aces '
 'between AQ and  KQ  and small pair hands then the big blind can profitably '
 'shove  of all hands and will therefore be exploiting you massively Secondly '
 'by minraising a hand like  you are giving your opponent good odds to defend '
 'their big blind with a wide range When that happens most of the time the '
 'flop is not going to hit us and were left with a very tough decision with '
 'almost no maneuverability due to our stack depth With a hand like  on the '
 'button it is definitely strong enough to make an unexploitable shove In '
 'general the  stack is considered a push or fold stack for a good reason its '
 'just not possible to create a balanced credible range of hands you can '
 'raisefold and thus it will be very easy for your opponents to adjust and '
 'take advantage of you The best way to become comfortable with playing this '
 'stack is to memorize the minimum hand you can profitably shove from each '
 'position A quick internet search will provide you with charts showing this '
 'If you can learn those ranges and then make adjustments in situations such '
 'as when playing on the bubble or when facing exceptionally loosetight '
 'opponents you will be making regular profitable decisions which is exactly '
 'what we want from our poker game There are some situations where it can be '
 'correct to flatcall a raise with a  stack This mostly applies when were in '
 'the big blind getting a great price to see a flop You will be surprised how '
 'many hands with which you can defend your big blind profitably assuming '
 'youre prepared to get the rest of your stack in when you connect with the '
 'flop in some way Example   Phil In the  buyin WSOP Asia Pacific  NoLimit '
 'Holdem Tournament in Melbourne in October  I found myself  in my battle to '
 'win my fourteenth WSOP Bracelet With the blinds at  I picked up  on the '
 'button and pondered my choices I had   in chips and I knew that the right '
 'mathematical play was to move allin I thought that an  raise would look weak '
 'because my standard opening bet that day was roughly  Thus I didnt want to '
 'open for ',
 'appear weak and then have to guess whether or not my opponent was strong '
 'ifwhen he reraised me preflop Next I considered opening for my standard  bet '
 'but I thought that there was a chance that my opponents might move me allin '
 'with a worse ace like  any small pair or even KQ KJ or K  I wasnt in love '
 'with opening for  and then putting myself in the spot where I had to call '
 'off the rest Thus I reasoned that I didnt want to open for  and fold So I '
 'opted to simply move allin I hear you cheering Liv The big blind who was '
 'sitting on  studied for a few minutes before calling with  This brings us to '
 'another question should he have called with  Even though I was playing very '
 'patiently Liv will confirm that the math says he should make the call In the '
 'past I didnt always call in that spot opting to wait for a better '
 'opportunity but this is one area where the math has more or less converted '
 'me Of course I will use my reading abilities to suss out whether or not I '
 'think that my opponent might actually have a super strong hand If my read '
 'says Look out this time I think he has a big pair then I will respect that '
 'read and fold my hand But without that read Im going to call  with pocket '
 'fours especially against a great player because I may not have another '
 'chance to take out that great player The rest of the story is that I lost '
 'the flip with my  versus his  and finished in fourth place Liv Yes this hand '
 'played out exactly as it should have You were correct to shove allin with  '
 'and he was correct to call with  According to the equity calculator he can '
 'call with all pairs down to  when we assume youre shoving all pairs most '
 'good Broadways and  and better He can call with an even wider range if you '
 'are shoving all of your Ax hands Example   Liv The following hands are from '
 'an online final table I played recently It was a  buyin turbo tournament and '
 'Ive just been moved to the  final table The very first hand it folds to me '
 'in the cutoff with  and a stack of  at  Im sure youre in agreement that this '
 'is a shove I win the pot uncontested and am up to  The very next hand I get '
 'dealt A  in the hijack again it is folded to me and although this is a bit '
 'closer I shove I get that one through too I fold the next hand and '
 'immediately get dealt  in  This situation felt really questionable '
 'especially with the recent history of me jamming and not getting called '
 'twice already in the first three hands of the final table An important '
 'factor to consider was that no other players were deepstacked either the '
 'largest stack being  As such all players were being very wary of ICMpay '
 'jumps and therefore were less likely to make light calls I jam my  stack  '
 'stack and get that through too The important work to do after the tournament '
 'is to analyze whether the last two shoves were indeed profitable by using '
 'the pushfold Holdem Resources calculator First I examined the A  hand by '
 'inputting the stacks positions and prize structure It returned the following '
 'chart',
 'The calculator deduces that I can shove  of all hands depicted in green when '
 'everyone folds to me Note that the numbers on each hand show the chipEV in '
 'units of big blinds meaning I win half of a big blind with this play on '
 'average Note that the program deduces that these plays are profitable by '
 'assuming that the players still to act arent calling looser than the calling '
 'ranges that the program indicates From experience poker players usually have '
 'tighter calling ranges than theyre meant to especially when there are '

 'flop of  Max checked and then I also checked By the way if he bet my last  '

 'probably folding my hand for a  bet Also Im folding on the river unless a '

 'was a  and now Max bet my last  I folded then Max showed four tens and we '

 'moved allin with A  and was called by the button and the big blind I scooped '

 'Melbourne when this hand came up early on Day  There were eight players at '
 'my table the blinds were  The first two players folded and the third player '
 'opened for  I had  offsuit With my tiny   chip stack I wasnt sure what the '
 'math',
 'suggested in this spot I felt like it was very close I didnt think my '
 'opponent was particularly strong I thought I had him beat but I knew that he '
 'was going to call  more so I knew I was going to a showdown and I had to '
 'worry about the four players behind me After a moment I thought that I might '
 'be able to find a better spot for my  so I folded However I regretted it '
 'immediately after I folded I wonder what Livs math says I was supposed to do '
 'in this spot Liv This is an interesting spot because so many players myself '
 'included often quit caring when their stack is this low so its nice to '
 'examine spots like this in real detail My initial instinct was to assume its '
 'an obvious go with it spot however after running the hand through a '
 'calculator it turns out to be a closer situation Of course the biggest '
 'factor is the playing style of the preflop raiser First lets take a look at '
 'a looser opening range of  which is    most Broadways and just a few suited '
 'connectors Versus this range jamming  wins  This might not sound like much '
 'but it represents  of our  stack For the cash gamers out there it translates '
 'to a  winrate Thats huge and thus we must take that spot Now lets examine '
 'the case where the opener is tighter opening  of hands which is   suited '
 'Broadways QJo and a couple of  and  hands Against this our  is only just '
 'profitable winning   Therefore against a tight player we could conceivably '
 'fold if we believe we have a decent edge on the table Back to your specific '
 'example Phil you said that your opponent didnt seem particularly strong and '
 'as such we apply the loose opening range scenario and deduce that this was a '
 'good spot to go with the  Note that in both cases I assumed that all of the '
 'other players in this hand have reasonable stacks of   or more Conclusion '
 'Phil The new school and I agree on a lot when it comes to short stack '
 'strategies In fact I listen to any and all new tactics that the math guys '
 'the new school players and the internet players come up with I listen '
 'because they are often powerful theories However just because a theory is '
 'powerful does not mean it is  right for me I may take a piece of advice here '
 'or there or even incorporate  of a theory when it comes to internet poker '
 'tournaments I use  of the new school theories Similarly I believe that you '
 'the reader should do the same add a few theories and tactics here and there '
 'to your nolimit holdem game Use whatever makes sense to you use whatever you '
 'can easily incorporate into the flow of your game and use it as long as you '
 'have success with it When something stops working then you have to examine '
 'it closely have you just been unlucky or is the unsuccessful tactic '
 'something that needs to go Personally I do not incorporate any of these '
 'theories and tactics into my game when they take tools out of my hands Know '
 'thyself know your strengths and your weaknesses Specifically for me my '
 'reading ability is my biggest strength and I would rather win or lose with '
 'my reads than with cold math This collaborative chapter between Liv Boeree '
 'and me ends with me respecting Liv respecting her deductive reasoning and '
 'logic and respecting the new school style of poker',

 ' VALUE BETTING VERSUS POT CONTROL Introduction After my first book Secrets '
 'of Professional Tournament Poker Volume  was released the most common piece '
 'of feedback I received from my students was how learning to control the size '
 'of the pot drastically increased their win rate Before Secrets was released '
 'most amateur players thought they had to bet with a hand such as top pair '
 'when their opponents checked to them for both value and protection because '
 'in their minds getting outdrawn was a huge disaster In exchange for making '
 'it a bit more difficult to get outdrawn they were willing to pile their '
 'entire stack in the pot when their opponents happened to have them beat A '
 'classic example of this is when a smart aggressive player raises to  out of '
 'his  stack and an amateur decides to reraise with AA to  from the button The '
 'smart player calls The flop comes  The smart player checks the amateur bets  '
 'and the smart player calls The turn is the KJ  The smart player checks the '
 'amateur bets  and the smart player goes allin for  more At this point almost '
 'all amateurs are more than happy to make the call After all they have AA '
 'What they fail to realize is that by betting the turn they allow their smart '
 'opponent to put his stack in only when he has AA beat If you have studied my '
 'training materials which you can find at the sites JonathanLittlePokercom '
 'and FloatTheTurncom you should know that you win at poker tournaments by '
 'playing in a manner that makes it difficult for you to go broke not by '
 'playing huge pots with strong but still nonpremium hands Reasons to pot '
 'control For those who are new to my teachings when you check on the flop '
 'turn or river usually in position with a strong but nonpremium hand such as '
 'KQ on  or AJ on  you are pot controlling There are many reasons why checking '
 'is better than betting The main reason for checking is because if you bet '
 'and your opponent continues in the pot either by calling or raising your '
 'hand is only in marginal shape against your opponents range However if you '
 'check you force your opponent to stay in the pot with a much wider range of '
 'hands you do well against Checking also makes your hand look weak because '
 'most players will assume you would bet most of your made hands for value and '
 'protection This will induce your opponents to try to bluff you on the later '
 'betting rounds which will almost always fail because you can easily call '
 'with your underrepresented hand Checking also makes it impossible for your '
 'opponents to put you in a terrible spot by checkraising Of course when you '
 'pot control you will occasionally get outdrawn by a hand that would not call '
 'if you instead opted to bet but that is a small risk compared to the huge '
 'rewards you will reap against most players For example suppose you raise '
 'from middle position with KJ to  out of your  stack and a loose aggressive '
 'player calls in the big blind The flop comes  Your opponent checks and you '
 'bet  Your opponent calls The turn is the  This is a reasonable spot to check '
 'behind for pot control If you bet the turn and get raised you should',
 'probably fold even against a loose aggressive player If you bet and get '
 'called you could easily be crushed or not have amazing equity such as when '
 'you are against   AJ or  Notice that if you check behind on the turn your '
 'opponent may bet on the river with most of his unpaired hands such as  or  '
 'and he may even bluff with a marginal made hand such as  or  If you check '
 'behind on the turn and a   or  comes on the river you will be in a tough '
 'spot if your opponent bets Since you should not have a straight too often '
 'and your loose aggressive opponent probably knows this you can usually make '
 'a herocall because much of the time you will have induced a bluff So this is '
 'a fantastic spot to check behind on the turn with the intention of calling a '
 'bet on most rivers If a nonstraight card comes on the river and your '
 'opponent checks you should usually bet for value You will find that most '
 'players will assume that you must be bluffing at least some percentage of '
 'the time given you checked behind on the turn This will lead to you being '
 'called down by a wide range of hands you crush If your opponent checks to '
 'you on a   or  river you can check behind electing to take a free showdown '
 'Hopefully you already know that before making any bet or check that you '
 'should have a solid plan for how you plan to proceed on the future betting '
 'rounds Even though my students were experiencing great success I realized '
 'through our private coaching sessions where I had the opportunity to deeply '
 'analyze their strategies through hand history analysis that they were '
 'blindly pot controlling almost all of the time This was especially the case '
 'when in position on the turn and they were checked to While this strategy '
 'will certainly keep you from overvaluing your marginal made hand and will '
 'make it difficult for you to go broke to any individual setup situation it '
 'will often make it quite difficult for you to maximize value especially '
 'against opponents who dont like to fold with any sort of decent holding '
 'Betting for value In this chapter I am going to outline when you should not '
 'pot control opting to bet for value instead While there are numerous '
 'situations in poker where there is a definitively correct play such as when '
 'you have  from first position before the flop automatic pot controlling in '
 'predetermined spots will leave a ton of money on the table My goal is to '
 'teach you when you should venture away from the safe haven of pot control '
 'and instead delve into the dangerous realm of thin value The main time you '
 'should not pot control is when you can realistically expect to get called by '
 'numerous hands that you currently beat This is often the case when the board '
 'is very dry such as  or K  Example  standard value betting You raise with A '
 'J to  out of your  stack from the button and a reasonably tight aggressive '
 'player calls from the small blind Lets assume you know that your opponent '
 'would almost certainly reraise with his premium hands before the flop '
 'including AA AK and AQ You also know that your opponent is not too prone to '
 'bluff by checkraising on any street He plays a fairly straightforward '
 'strategy which he probably learned from an old obsolete poker book The flop '
 'comes A Q  Your opponent checks This is a great spot to make a standard '
 'continuation bet of around  into the  pot It would be nearly impossible for '
 'anyone to fold an Ax or Qx hand to any reasonable flop bet So you bet  and',
 'your opponent calls The turn is the A Q   Your opponent checks again At this '
 'point you have to figure out if your opponent can realistically call another '
 'bet with a worse Ax or a Qx hand Quite often especially against players who '
 'are paying attention the way your specific opponent thinks you play will '
 'drastically alter his calling range If you have been blatantly wild recently '
 'attempting a decent amount of bluffs you should expect your opponent to call '
 'your turn bet with a much wider range than if you have folded every hand '
 'during the last hour If you play as I recommend in Secrets you will usually '
 'have at least a somewhat active image This means that you should expect most '
 'of your opponents to never fold an Ax to a turn bet Some players will have a '
 'difficult time folding Qx as well Notice that most of the queens in your '
 'opponents range should be with a reasonable kicker such as K Q QJ or  If '
 'your opponent had a pair of queens on the flop his hand almost certainly did '
 'not improve on the turn If he had an Ax he could easily have  or  and be '
 'going for a checkraise Since you know that your opponent isnt too inclined '
 'to checkraise as a bluff if he checkraises you should assume that you are '
 'against at least  and easily fold your AJ because you are drawing almost '
 'dead Against the range of probable hands  and better you only have  equity '
 'Do not fall into the habit of thinking that just because you have a good '
 'hand that you have to continue until the river This specific situation '
 'should lead you to make a bet of around  into the  pot Your opponent decides '
 'to call your bet It is worth noting that some players who do not properly '
 'understand hand values may decide to check raise on the turn with any Ax '
 'assuming that their top pair must be the nuts Against that type of player it '
 'is probably intelligent to pot control because you will have no clue where '
 'you stand if you get check raised You dont particularly want to play a '
 'gigantic pot against even a range containing a decent amount of hands that '
 'you beat Against a range containing   and  to  you have  equity which is '
 'great for you However you will probably be unsure about how your opponent '
 'will act on the river If you know that he will mindlessly bet the river with '
 'this entire range you could call his turn checkraise and also his river bet '
 'If you know that he will only bet the river with hands that beat your AJ you '
 'should call his turn checkraise and fold if he bets the river Since you '
 'almost certainly have no idea how your opponent will actually proceed on the '
 'river you should look to avoid that scenario by pot controlling You will '
 'often find that pot controlling is a good idea if you are unsure how your '
 'opponent will react when facing a turn bet When your opponent checks to you '
 'on the river you have to figure out if he can again call another bet You '
 'should always make a point to try to figure out which river cards you should '
 'bet and which you should check In general an       and  are all decently '
 'good for you because you only lose if your opponent improved to two pair '
 'Especially if you dont bet too large on the river you should assume most '
 'straightforward players will call a bet with any A especially if you have an '
 'active aggressive image If a K Q J  or  comes on the river you should be a '
 'bit more inclined to check behind because you could easily be against an Ax '
 'or Qx that improved to two pair While I always do my best to pick up on the '
 'physical tells of my opponents and act accordingly it is in situations such '
 'as these that this information becomes crucial If I get the vibe that my '
 'opponent did not improve I will tend to value bet If I think he is happy '
 'with the river card I will certainly check behind If I am playing online or '
 'if I have no physical tells at all I will tend to check behind almost every '
 'time when',
 'I am playing online or if I have no physical tells at all I will tend to '
 'check behind almost every time when a bad card comes If I have no reads and '
 'I am unsure if my opponent will call a value bet with only a marginal Ax I '
 'will also check behind because I will have a difficult time getting called '
 'by many hands worse than my AJ Remember when you are value betting you need '
 'to get called at least  of the time when you have the best hand Even though '
 'I expect to win this pot a ton of the time if I check behind on the',
 'river perhaps as much as  of the time if I bet and get called I will lose '
 'much more often because my opponents river checkcalling range is obviously '
 'much stronger than only his river checking range It is important to realize '
 'that once you bet the river your opponent will fold most of his marginal '
 'holdings Example  facing a calling station You should also be inclined to '
 'forego pot control when you are against someone who is obviously a calling '
 'station even on somewhat scary boards Again it is ideal if you think that '
 'your opponent will not bluff raise too often As an example suppose you raise '
 'to  out of your  stack with Q  from the button and your calling station '
 'opponent calls from the big blind You are unsure which hands he would '
 'reraise with before the flop All you know is that he doesnt like to fold too '
 'often with any sort of made hand after the flop The flop comes Q J  Your '
 'opponent checks to you As in the previous example this is a great spot to '
 'make a standard continuation bet because you will get called by numerous '
 'worse made hands and draws You bet  into the  pot and your opponent calls '
 'Before moving forward it is important to note that it is usually a good idea '
 'to bet slightly larger against opponents who are calling stations especially '
 'if they are not paying attention to your default bet sizing Pots in nolimit '
 'and potlimit games grow exponentially Betting even a tiny bit more on the '
 'flop will allow you to bet significantly more on the river Against the worst '
 'players who are not paying attention at all you should even consider making '
 'drastically different bet sizes based on your hands strength although that '
 'is usually a risky idea because it is tough to know who is not paying '
 'attention at all The turn is the Q J   Your opponent checks to you This is a '
 'scenario where most of my students would happily check behind for pot '
 'control but I think that is a fairly large error Even though one of the most '
 'obvious draws  improved to a straight you should strongly consider betting '
 'again especially if you do not expect your opponent to checkraise bluff too '
 'often If you are unsure if he will checkraise bluff you should be more '
 'inclined to check behind That being said you will find that most players '
 'simply do not have a turn checkraise bluff in their arsenal Of course if '
 'your opponent was a good aggressive player who could checkraise the turn '
 'either for value or as a bluff you should strongly consider checking behind '
 'with the intention of calling most river bets If you bet the turn you should '
 'expect your calling station opponent to call with a wide range of worse made '
 'hands including any Qx Jx possibly any other paired hand and also a draw You '
 'should probably make a bet of around  into the  pot purely for value If you '
 'think your opponent may fold some of his marginal made hands to a  bet you '
 'should perhaps bet around  instead The last thing you want to do is make a '
 'bet that is slightly larger than normal that results in your opponent '
 'folding a wide range of hands you crush when a smaller bet would keep all of '
 'those hands in Lets assume that you bet  and your opponent calls The river '
 'is the Q J    Your opponent checks again Unfortunately another one of the '
 'obvious draws completed While physical reads would certainly play a role in '
 'my decision to bet or check I would tend to bet again especially if I '
 'thought that my opponent may bet into me if he improved to a flush Notice if '
 'my opponent does not have a flush or a straight I',
 'almost certainly have the best hand unless he has exactly  or  because most '
 'players would check raise on the drawheavy flop with two pair or a set It is '
 'important to try to figure out how large a bet your opponent can call with a '
 'junky made hand when most of the draws complete by the river Some opponents '
 'will only call small bets while others will assume that you simply must be '
 'bluffing if you make a large bet In general the more straightforward my '
 'opponent is the more likely I am to make a smaller bet If my opponent is '
 'particularly creative I will at least consider making a large bet You will '
 'find that most opponents will assume that a large bet means that you have a '
 'premium hand This should lead you to make a fairly conservative bet of '
 'around  into the  pot hoping your opponent is willing to pay the cheap price '
 'to ensure that you are not bluffing him If my opponent has seen me make a '
 'large bluff at any point in the past I will consider making a very large '
 'value bet perhaps as large as  into the  pot Of course I have to assume that '
 'my opponent will have the fortitude to make a large call which most players '
 'simply will not However if you can accurately pinpoint the rare situations '
 'where you should make this gigantic bet you will significantly increase your '
 'win rate This example illustrates that the more you know about your '
 'opponents tendencies the more you can get out of line to take advantage of '
 'them If you can pay attention to your opponents and implement plays to take '
 'advantage of them in the long run you will demolish them Example  inducing a '
 'wild player Another time you should look to avoid pot control is when your '
 'opponent is blatantly wild especially if he thinks you will fold almost all '
 'of your range to a huge amount of postflop aggression If you think your '
 'opponent will try to bluff you give him the opportunity to try it in spots '
 'where you know that you are not going to fold You raise with QJ to  out of '
 'your  stack from middle position and your wild aggressive opponent calls on '
 'the button The flop is  You bet  into the  pot and your opponent calls While '
 'you could check looking to checkcall you will find that making what appears '
 'to be a totally standard continuation bet will set your opponent up to make '
 'much larger errors on the turn and river Some players may think that '
 'checkraising is a good idea trapping their opponent for a small bet on the '
 'flop but in reality all that does is let your opponent know both quickly and '
 'cheaply that you have a strong holding That is the exact opposite of what '
 'you want to do The turn is  At this point you can either bet or check '
 'depending on how you expect your opponent to react Remember you are not '
 'planning to fold If your opponent happens to have you beat you are going to '
 'lose a decent amount of money on this hand By playing in a wild manner your '
 'opponent has almost guaranteed that you pay him off which is one of the main '
 'benefits of employing a wild strategy If you think that your opponent thinks '
 'you will blindly twobarrel the turn with a wide range including premium '
 'hands marginal made hands draws and air you should probably bet again This '
 'turn bet will either induce your opponent to call looking to bluff you on '
 'the river or raise hoping to force you to fold most of your nonpremium hands '
 'on the turn If you think that he will fold if you bet the turn assuming you '
 'will bet with most of your made hands and check when you have nothing you '
 'should check If you check and your opponent bets you usually want to appear '
 'as unhappy as possible when making the call hopefully inducing him to '
 'attempt another bluff on the river Your opponent may think you are the type '
 'of player he can push around with aggression especially if he',
 'is known to play an unbalanced style meaning that he will raise when he '
 'thinks you will fold and call when he doesnt want you to fold When this type '
 'of player raises your turn bet you should expect him to have mostly bluffs '
 'in his range If you know that your opponent is bluffing a large percentage '
 'of the time your QJ is effectively the nuts Of course that doesnt mean you '
 'should reraise if your opponent raises your turn bet because that will allow '
 'him to play perfectly Instead call your opponents raise and happily continue '
 'to the river looking to call most river bets As stated in both of the '
 'previous examples if you are unsure how your opponent will react when facing '
 'a turn bet it is usually best to check opting to control the size of the pot '
 'If you bet the turn your opponent raises and you call you should be looking '
 'to call on most river cards even though the pot will be quite large The only '
 'rivers you should consider folding are a  or  and even then against the '
 'wildest opponents you should consider making a herocall Your opponent almost '
 'certainly realizes that those cards should be much better for his range than '
 'for yours leading him to bluff a huge percentage of the time Notice that if '
 'you bet  on the turn and call your opponents turn raise to  then when your '
 'opponent bets the river you will usually be in a situation where you are '
 'facing a roughly  bet into a  pot which will nearly put you allin some '
 'opponents will even make an allin river bet If you instead decide to check '
 'the turn and call when your opponent bets  you will be facing a  bet into a  '
 'pot on the river putting you nowhere near allin If you know your opponent '
 'well enough to know that in each of these situations he will have roughly '
 'the same range against which you are in fantastic shape you would much '
 'rather play the huge pot even though you will occasionally go broke By pot '
 'controlling even though you certainly induce your opponent to make errors '
 'you miss out on investing significantly more money compared to when you '
 'simply continue betting on the turn This is a situation where pot control is '
 'profitable but betting is much more profitable assuming you know your '
 'opponent Example  when bad cards can come Another time you should avoid pot '
 'control is when the cards that are likely to arrive on the next street could '
 'easily make your hand much worse While it is clear that you often want to '
 'bet for protection when there are a decent number of draws on the board you '
 'should also strongly consider betting when your top pair is not too large '
 'Suppose you raise with   from middle position to  out of your  stack and the '
 'big blind a somewhat straightforward player calls The flop comes    Your '
 'opponent checks you bet  into the  pot and your opponent calls The turn is '
 'the    K If your opponent checks you should strongly consider betting again '
 'mainly because your opponent could easily have various hands that either '
 'turned a decent amount of equity such as  or still have some equity that you '
 'dont mind folding out such as AJ or  By betting again on the turn you will '
 'also get value from some worse made hands such as  and  In this situation if '
 'you bet the turn and your opponent calls unless your hand improves on the '
 'river it is usually smart to check behind because most opponents will have a '
 'tough time calling a river bet with worse than your marginal middle pair '
 'Also notice that if you check behind on the turn you should also check '
 'behind on the river due to the scary board which means that you will miss '
 'out on some amount of value that you could have extracted with a turn bet Be '
 'careful to not fall into the trap of thinking that just because you won a '
 'hand or because nothing went terribly wrong that you played the hand '
 'correctly Always think about alternative betting lines and how',
 'terribly wrong that you played the hand correctly Always think about '
 'alternative betting lines and how they would have likely played out Quite '
 'often you will find a betting line that is better than the decent',
 'line you took Considering the effective stack size Your cards and your '
 'opponents tendencies are not the only determining factors in deciding '
 'whether or not you should pot control You also have to pay attention to the '
 'effective stack sizes Remember one of the main goals of pot control is to '
 'make it difficult for you to go broke on any individual hand When the stacks '
 'are deep  or more in single raised pots it is usually not mandatory to pot '
 'control because it is quite difficult to get your entire stack in by the '
 'river unless your opponent takes an overly aggressive line which should '
 'hopefully tip you off to the fact that he has a premium hand Of course if '
 'you are unsure if your opponents aggressive betting lines signify strength '
 'or weakness you should still consider pot controlling in situations where '
 'you cannot withstand much pressure All of this becomes moot if the pot was '
 'reraised before the flop because it is quite easy to get even a deep stack '
 'in the pot with only a few sizable streets of aggression If it will be '
 'difficult to invest a huge amount of chips in terms of your stack in a '
 'specific situation your main concern should be to extract value not to '
 'control the size of the pot You will find that it is much easier to get thin '
 'value when deepstacked compared to when you are shorter stacked because your '
 'opponents will be less inclined to fold marginal made hands and draws until '
 'they get to the river They often think that because you are betting on the '
 'flop and turn they must have large implied odds going to the river Of course '
 'if you play well and pay attention to your opponents you will rarely pay '
 'them off when they improve to a hand that beats yours negating their '
 'potential implied odds Suppose you raise with KJ to  out of your  stack from '
 'middle position and a relatively straightforward splashy player calls from '
 'the big blind The flop comes  Your opponent checks you bet  and he calls The '
 'turn is the  This is an excellent spot to bet again especially if you do not '
 'think your opponent will checkraise as a bluff With deep stacks if you bet '
 'roughly  into the  pot your opponent will have a difficult time folding any '
 'pair or draw If your opponent calls the river is an A Q  or  and he bets '
 'into you you should usually make a fairly standard fold unless you think '
 'your opponent is prone to bluff when the river brings a somewhat scary card '
 'If the river is any other card you should also consider folding when bet '
 'into if you dont think your opponent will try to bluff you too often Of '
 'course if you think your opponent will try to bluff you dont be afraid to '
 'make the call on any river card The main time that the effective stack size '
 'should lead you to consider pot controlling is when you can play an '
 'additional hand if you lose a pot where there is a preflop raise a flop bet '
 'then one other bet on either the turn or river but not when there is a '
 'preflop raise a flop bet a turn bet and a river bet You will find this is '
 'often the case when you have between  and  Of course there is a big spread '
 'between  and  You strongly want to consider pot controlling almost almost '
 'not always indiscriminately with your marginal made hands when you have '
 'between  and  especially if your opponents are not aware that you are '
 'capable of checking behind on the turn with marginal made hands Lets assume '
 'that you raise to  out of your  stack before the flop bet  on the flop and  '
 'on either the turn or the river If you lose you will have  left which is '
 'more than enough to maintain some amount of maneuverability In fact you can '
 'lose two more equally costly hands before going broke If instead you raise '
 'to  preflop bet  on the flop  on the turn and  on the river then if you lose '
 'you will only have  remaining By pot controlling you can lose three',
 'the river then if you lose you will only have  remaining By pot controlling '
 'you can lose three hands before going broke instead of two Having one extra '
 'opportunity will drastically increase your chances of survival which must be '
 'one of your primary concerns when playing poker tournaments',
 'When you have fewer than  you will have a tough time getting to a showdown '
 'with any decently strong hand without investing your entire stack For this '
 'reason pot control is not superrelevant with this stack size Instead your '
 'main goal should be to get full value from your strong hands Also the '
 'concept of picking up the pot when your opponent has some amount of equity '
 'becomes relevant because it is a disaster to give a free card that costs you '
 'the pot when the pot is huge compared to the size of your stack For example '
 'suppose you raise with A  to  out of your  stack from middle position '
 'depending on the players yet to act you also consider going allin or folding '
 'and a straightforward player calls in the big blind The flop comes    Your '
 'opponent checks you bet  and he calls The turn is the     Your opponent '
 'checks again At this point you do not want to check behind because any K Q '
 'J       or  could give you the second best hand At the same time your '
 'opponent will almost certainly continue if he has  or a decent draw This '
 'should lead you to continue betting going allin for  into the  big blind pot '
 'While you could bet smaller when your stack is around a potsized bet or less '
 'which it roughly is in this situation winning the pot and forcing your '
 'opponent off a hand that almost certainly has some amount of equity should '
 'be your main concern It should be made clear that you will occasionally be '
 'against a better made hand that your opponent decided to slow play such as '
 'JJ or  He could also have improved on the turn with  or  He may even decide '
 'to call your turn allin with a marginal hand such as  You have to realize '
 'that if you decide to check behind on the turn you will almost always find '
 'yourself calling a sizable bet on the river Both betting and checking lead '
 'to you getting your stack in on most rivers You have to ask yourself if the '
 'chances of putting your stack in bad some percentage of the time on the turn '
 'outweigh the odds of your opponent improving to a hand that beats yours or '
 'possibly gets off the hook on the river if you check behind on the turn On a '
 'board like this you will find that betting is usually ideal If instead of  '
 'the board was  you should strongly consider checking behind on the turn '
 'because it is much more difficult for your opponent to improve to a hand '
 'that beats you on the river He will probably only call a turn push with top '
 'pair or better which is almost the exact same range with which he will pay '
 'off a river bet This means that by checking behind on the turn you give your '
 'opponent the opportunity to bluff you in a situation where he is unlikely to '
 'outdraw you Summary I hope these examples have illustrated situations where '
 'you should opt to ignore pot control Whenever you learn a new concept or '
 'strategy always be sure to think about it in all situations and contexts One '
 'of the worst mistakes you can make is to assume a technique is equally '
 'useful in all situations While you will certainly be a more profitable poker '
 'player if you blindly pot control with your marginal made hands compared to '
 'blindly betting with them if you intelligently pick the correct play based '
 'on your hand your opponents tendencies your image in your opponents eyes and '
 'your stack size then you will crush the games To summarize here is a '
 'checklist of the questions you should ask yourself whenever you are '
 'considering pot controlling with a strong but not amazing made hand While '
 'poker can rarely be played by following a simple checklist this one should '
 'put you on the right track If I check will my opponent frequently try to '
 'bluff on future betting rounds If yes pot control If I check will my '
 'opponent value bet made hands worse than mine on future betting rounds If '
 'yes pot control',
 'If I check will my opponent value bet made hands worse than mine on future '
 'betting rounds If yes pot control If I check will my opponent call one more '
 'bet with a hand that may fold to an immediate bet If yes pot control',
 'If I bet and my opponent raises will I be confused about whether or not I '
 'should continue in the pot If yes pot control If I bet will my opponent call '
 'with numerous worse made hands while raising with primarily hands I lose to '
 'If yes do not pot control If I bet and my opponent raises can I confidently '
 'assume I have the best hand and happily continue in the pot If yes do not '

 ' TACKLING A FINAL TABLE Introduction While most poker players dream of '
 'making a major final table very few actually spend the requisite time '
 'working hard on their strategies so they can succeed once they get there I '
 'was lucky in that my game of choice early in my poker career was online '
 'sitngo tournaments These games are effectively a final table where everyone '
 'starts with the same amount of chips Everyone plays until one player has all '
 'the chips The blinds escalate like a normal poker tournament  place usually '
 'gets  of the prize pool  gets  and  gets  Everyone else gets nothing When I '
 'played these games early in my career it was blatantly obvious to me that a '
 'large percentage of the players had no clue that they should alter their '
 'strategy based on where their stack size stood in relation to their '
 'opponents as the tournament progressed There are spots where you should call '
 'an allin with any two cards and there are others where you should fold '
 'almost everything simply based on the payout structure and each players '
 'stack size Eventually most of the player pool learned that you have to make '
 'these adjustments if you do not want to quickly lose your bankroll When I '
 'moved to live multitable tournaments I realized again that most of the '
 'players did not do their homework when it came to final table play Instead '
 'most players are either playing purely to try to win or purely to try to '
 'move slowly up the payout ladder While both of these strategies have merit '
 'from time to time if you blindly follow either of them you will leave a ton '
 'of money on the table Unlike sitngo tournaments where you can play over  per '
 'month if you dedicate your life to them in large tournaments the '
 'recreational players have never gained enough experience to master the '
 'intricacies of this format because it is difficult to make final tables This '
 'is one of the main reasons why large poker tournaments remain so profitable '
 'for the skilled players While it is certainly prestigious to win a poker '
 'tournament quite often you will find that the strategy that yields the most '
 'equity is one that will often result in you not winning In this section I am '
 'going to explain the Independent Chip Model and then outline how to alter '
 'your play drastically with each stack size to give you the best opportunity '
 'to win as much money as possible when you find yourself at a final table The '
 'Independent Chip Model The Independent Chip Model or ICM is a mathematical '
 'model used to determine how much your chip stack is worth based on the size '
 'of your stack in relation to your opponents stacks and the prize structure '
 'Most recreational players assume that if you have  of the chips in play you '
 'should own  of the prize pool This is blatantly incorrect In reality your '
 'stacks value depends on the payout structure as',
 'well as your opponents stack sizes Since there are now numerous online and '
 'mobile phone applications that can compute ICM calculations quickly and '
 'effortlessly for you I am not going to use space in this book showing you '
 'how to actually solve somewhat complex ICM equations by hand If you want to '
 'learn how to do that I suggest you consult Google You dont need to be able '
 'to calculate by hand your stacks value at the table However knowing and '
 'understanding your stacks value is essential You may be wondering how you '
 'are expected to be able to apply the ICM concepts I am about to discuss '
 'while at the poker table given the relatively large amount of math involved '
 'You have to spend time away from the table studying When I was playing '
 'sitngo tournaments at the start of my career I would spend about four hours '
 'a day playing poker and six hours a day studying ICM situations Only after I '
 'found myself making almost no errors while quizzing myself did I start '
 'playing significantly more poker The players who think they will get better '
 'reasonably fast if they play a lot of poker are fooling themselves Given '
 'that you will only occasionally make the final table of a multitable '
 'tournament you have to be sure to make the most of it In order to do this '
 'you have to spend numerous hours studying away from the table Luckily for '
 'you there are various online tools that can quiz you on random ICM '
 'situations asking you whether or not you should either go allin or fold when '
 'everyone folds to you or if you should call or fold when facing an allin '
 'based on your opponents pushing range everyones stack size and the payout '
 'structure If you study diligently you will eventually figure out how to come '
 'up with the correct play in almost all scenarios Key ICM concepts There are '
 'a few key concepts that you must understand that are firmly rooted in ICM '
 'First when you double up you are not actually doubling your equity For '
 'example lets assume there are four players left in a tournament where '
 'everyone has  of the chips  place is   is   is  and  is  Currently each '
 'stack is worth  all of the stack values in this section were quickly found '
 'using a mobile ICM calculator application If you get allin with  equity '
 'meaning you will double up half the time and go broke half the time when you '
 'lose your equity is now   place money and when you win it is  Notice that '
 'the total of these two numbers is only  whereas combined you and your '
 'opponent put  in equity into the pot The other  in equity is split between '
 'the two players who were not involved in the pot This is because they just '
 'guaranteed that they will take at least  place whereas prior to the hand '
 'they were only guaranteed  place money This means that you should strive to '
 'avoid situations where you will have most or all of your money invested in a '
 'breakeven scenario That being said most players do not understand what '
 'constitutes a breakeven situation You have to factor into your decision your '
 'pot odds as well as the stack you will have remaining if you fold avoiding '
 'the allin confrontation For example assume there are four players remaining '
 'at a final table using the above payouts If everyone has  it would be '
 'criminal to raise with a hand such as  or AQ from the button and fold to an '
 'allin from a player in the big blind who is reasonably loose and active '
 'because both  and AQ should be well ahead of the pushers range Using ICM you '
 'can figure out if you should make the call or fold in this situation If you '
 'fold your hand to the allin bet you will drop from  in equity to  in equity '
 'If you call the allin with roughly  equity you will have   in equity  of the '
 'time and  place money   of the time If you multiply each outcome by the '
 'percentage of time it will occur you have  ',
 ' equity you will have   in equity  of the time and  place money   of the '
 'time If you multiply each outcome by the percentage of time it will occur '
 'you have      You should call because  when you call is larger than  when '
 'you fold If you ran the numbers and your equity when you folded was higher '
 'than when you called',
 'the allin you should fold It is important to choose the option that results '
 'in you having the highest amount of equity If instead the player who went '
 'allin from the big blind was overly tight meaning your AQ or  would only '
 'have around  equity your decision would be much closer In fact you should '
 'probably fold especially if you are confident that your opponent is rarely '
 'bluffing Of course most players will not play this tight with only four '
 'players at the table Another major concept you can learn from ICM is how to '
 'play when there is a player with an overly short stack perhaps  or less when '
 'the average stack size is  or more In this situation if you have a '
 'reasonable stack you want to make a point to not open yourself up to going '
 'broke This is because you will almost certainly not be the next player to '
 'bust Suppose there are again four players remaining with the same payouts '
 'with  getting   getting   getting  and  getting  Player A has  Player B has  '
 'Player C has  and Player D has  The value of each stack is currently    and  '
 'If Player B and Player C the two middle stacks get involved in an allin '
 'confrontation the result will be Player A having  the confrontation winner '
 'having  Player D having  and the confrontation loser having  place money  '
 'Notice that by getting allin the two middle stacks gave Player A  in equity '
 'and Player D  in equity In order to want to get allin in this situation as a '
 'middle stack you have to expect to have a huge edge in the pot If you are '
 'feeling frisky try to figure out how much equity you need to have in order '
 'to profitably get allin as a middle stack in this situation I also suggest '
 'you play around with an ICM calculator to see what happens when various '
 'other stacks such as Player A and Player B get allin Notice then there will '
 'be three players remaining when Player A wins and four players remaining '
 'when Player B wins When someone is really short such as when Player A has  '
 'Player B has  Player C has  and Player D has  it is really important that '
 'Player B and Player C avoid going broke If Player B and Player C get allin '
 'they will be giving Player A  and Player D  in equity Clearly at that point '
 'you have to expect to have a gigantic edge to justify getting allin ICM at '
 'and before the final table While the above examples have only dealt with '
 'very shorthanded situations ICM should start altering your decisions as soon '
 'as you make it to the final table Looking at sitngo tournaments as an '
 'example where  place gets  of the prize pool  gets  and  gets  At the start '
 'of a   buyin sitngo everyone has  in equity However if someone goes broke '
 'everyone besides the player who doubled up now has  in equity If two other '
 'players with their starting stacks decide to get allin the remaining players '
 'who have yet to play a pot now have  in equity By folding they have '
 'profited  This is because they are slowly moving towards getting in the '
 'money If the two players who doubled up decide to get allin versus each '
 'other the remaining six players who have not played a hand will now have  in '
 'equity Survival in nonwinnertakeall situations has a lot of merit Coming '
 'into a final table it is not uncommon for multiple players to have ideas of '
 'pushing their opponents around trying to maximize their opportunity to win '
 'the tournament Quite often some of these players will quickly go broke If '
 'you get lucky enough to make a major final table your equity could be '
 'gigantic perhaps  or more If you play snugly while these aggressive players '
 'are trying to out macho each other and one or two of them go broke you will '
 'have increased your equity by  or more with absolutely no risk While most '
 'players think that being somewhat carddead is a disaster it',
 'more with absolutely no risk While most players think that being somewhat '
 'carddead is a disaster it actually isnt too bad because it keeps you out of '
 'trouble while allowing you to move up the payout ladder I recently played in '
 'a  buyin turbo event where everyone came to the final table with roughly the',
 'same amount of chips I had no playable hands at all over the course of an '
 'hour which feels like an eternity in a turbo event Despite my lack of cards '
 'I managed to take  place While my goal was certainly to win when you are '
 'carddead it is important to realize that you are making money by remaining '
 'calm and not putting your stack in with very little equity Of course I '
 'eventually got all of my money in with roughly  equity but not before I '
 'locked up a nice payday ICM also applies even before you get to the final '
 'table While the payout jumps are not quite as pronounced you will often be '
 'on small bubbles where moving up the payout ladder is a minor concern If you '
 'find yourself deep in a tournament that has a huge number of players '
 'perhaps  or more the payout jumps well before the final table can be '
 'significant in terms of buyins Additionally you can often push amateur '
 'players around on the final table bubble because they may put some amount of '
 'intrinsic value on actually making the final table even though the payout '
 'jump may only be a few dollars Some players may really want to get on '
 'television in a major tournament resulting in them drastically altering '
 'their strategies in hopes of realizing their dream Always pay attention to '
 'your opponents and adjust when it becomes clear they are on an imaginary '
 'bubble While ICM can teach you numerous valuable lessons about final table '
 'strategy it is not without its drawbacks The problem with simple '
 'mathematical models is that they fail to account for relatively intangible '
 'factors For example ICM assumes that all players are equally skilled at '
 'poker which is not true If you are significantly better than your opponents '
 'your stack size is not actually reflective of how often you will finish in '
 'each payout position This results in the value of your stack being worth '
 'much more equity than the amount of dollars you cash for when you go broke '
 'Your skill level doesnt matter once you have zero chips and some amount of '
 'cash This is one of the main reasons why most professionals try to avoid '
 'calling off their stack in allin situations especially when deep in a '
 'tournament ICM also doesnt account for the constantly rising blinds If you '
 'are playing in a fastpaced tournament where the blinds escalate quickly even '
 'a large stack could be quite short meaning you will not have much fold '
 'equity One of your primary tools at a final table will be your ability to '
 'put your opponents in situations where they should fold most of their range '
 'If you have few chips this will be nearly impossible to accomplish In '
 'general as the stack sizes shrink the edge of the superior players '
 'diminishes ICM also underestimates the chip leaders equity As I will discuss '
 'in the next section having a big stack allows you to apply immense pressure '
 'to the middle stacks allowing you to grind them down with little risk For '
 'this reason you should often avoid making calls that put your large stack at '
 'risk For example if the stacks are    and  the  stack should make a point to '
 'avoid confrontations with the  stack even though he cannot bust him on any '
 'individual hand If the current big stack loses  he will be tied for the '
 'middle stack in a situation where the new big stack can slowly grind down '
 'the middle stacks This is the exact situation you do not want to find '
 'yourself in ICM doesnt account for the position of the various stacks In '
 'general you will have much more playability if the players on your left have '
 'fewer chips than you compared to when they have more chips than you Also you '
 'would much prefer the players on your left to be tight and straightforward '
 'compared to loose and deceptive If you have a decent seat at the table in '
 'relation to the other stacks it often makes sense to fold in a breakeven or '
 'slightly profitable spot if losing a large pot will set up the table such '
 'that',
 'sense to fold in a breakeven or slightly profitable spot if losing a large '
 'pot will set up the table such that there is a big stack on your left '
 'severely diminishing your stacks playability While the topic of ICM can be '
 'quite daunting if you take it slow and spend a lot of time studying how '
 'various stack sizes player types payout structures and positions should '
 'alter your play you will be well on your way to mastering final table play',
 'Stack sizes at the final table In this section I am going to explain how you '
 'should approach playing the final table based on both your and your '
 'opponents stack sizes This section will assume a relatively standard '
 'multitable tournament payout structure where there are no abnormal payout '
 'jumps It is important to realize that over the course of any final table '
 'your stack size will fluctuate Just because you start the final table with '
 'the largest stack does not mean that you will maintain the largest stack '
 'throughout the event If you start with a tiny stack recognize that you could '
 'run it up to a big stack If you get overwhelmed with the wild yet standard '
 'and expected swings that are inherent to tournament poker you will not think '
 'clearly If you dont think clearly you are guaranteed to make costly errors '
 'It is important to realize that you do not need to be overly concerned with '
 'exact chip counts Instead you will need to estimate and realize which stacks '
 'are effectively the same For example if the stacks at your table are      '
 'and  the  and  stacks are effectively the same the  and  stacks are '
 'effectively the same and the  and  stacks are effectively the same Dont make '
 'the amateur blunder of assuming that the  stack should employ a drastically '
 'different strategy than the  stack As stated earlier the position of each '
 'stack is also important You also have to be aware of your opponents '
 'tendencies For example if you have  and the other six players at your table '
 'have  there are times you should play a tight straightforward strategy and '
 'other times where you should raise every hand depending on whether your '
 'opponents are capable of pushing over your preflop raises with a wide range '
 'Before committing to any action always ask yourself if the likely result '
 'will lead to profitable situations for you If you fail to make the proper '
 'adjustments you will spew a ton of equity Please be aware that if you find '
 'yourself at a tough table where your opponents will not let you get away '
 'with the highlevel plays listed below there is nothing wrong with playing a '
 'fundamentally sound strategy By not getting too far out of line you will '
 'make it difficult for your opponents to exploit you That being said if you '
 'dont get too far out of line it will be difficult for you to be a huge '
 'winner In this section I am going to outline numerous strategies I implement '
 'when I am fortunate enough to make it to a final table that allow me to win '
 'much more equity than my opponents who simply play their standard default '
 'strategy When you have the largest stack by a wide margin When you have the '
 'largest stack at a final table you are in an amazingly profitable situation '
 'not only because you have the most chips but because you can use those chips '
 'to apply immense pressure on everyone else The ability to force your '
 'opponents to make a decision for all of their chips is powerful especially '
 'if your opponents can easily fold and almost guarantee they move up the '
 'payout ladder For this reason you want to apply the most pressure to the '
 'middle stacks who are unlikely to go broke in the near future While most '
 'poker players think that it is a huge success to move up the payout ladder '
 'which induces them to try to bust the short stacks when you have the largest '
 'stack you actually do not want anyone to bust This is because you are almost '
 'certainly not going to be the next person out Also if the middle stacks '
 'avoid you they will also probably not be the next to bust This means that '
 'you have a prime situation to apply pressure on all of the middle stacks '
 'while they wait around for the short stacks to go broke For example if you '
 'have  four players have  and two players have  it would be a',
 'disaster for any of the players with  to go broke before either of the '
 'players with  This should lead you to frequently steal the blinds of the '
 'players with  and to also reraise whenever they decide to raise Especially '
 'if the players with  are raising with a fairly standard range which means '
 'they are clearly failing to adjust to the table dynamics you should go allin '
 'with a wide range because they need a premium hand to call even if they know '
 'you are pushing them around with an overly wide range The most ideal '
 'situation you could be in at a final table is one where you have a stack '
 'larger than most of your opponents lets assume  a tiny stack is on your left '
 'with  and everyone else has a medium stack between  and  When everyone folds '
 'to you you should minraise with any two cards If the short stack goes allin '
 'over your preflop raise you can fold assuming the short stack is not pushing '
 'allin over your raises too often If the short stack folds to your preflop '
 'raise which will happen most of the time no one else will want to get '
 'involved because they will want to wait for the short stack to go broke '
 'before risking their stack When someone raises you can go allin with a wide '
 'range since they cannot call because again they do not want to go broke '
 'before the short stack When everyone folds to you in the small blind you '
 'should fold giving the short stacked player a walk maintaining this '
 'profitable situation By implementing this strategy unless you run into a '
 'premium hand you will quickly grind down your opponents resulting in your '
 'opponents eventually all having small stacks while you have almost all of '
 'the chips From there you will have to win some hands to conquer the final '
 'table but given you have way more chips than your opponents you will win a '
 'huge percentage of the time In the real world poker is rarely this simple '
 'but when it is it is difficult to lose It is worth mentioning that some '
 'medium stacked players will be clueless regarding the concept that they '
 'should try to outlast the short stacks You will likely be able to pinpoint '
 'these players quickly because they will not be afraid to play pots with you '
 'Especially when raising into these players big blinds you should not get too '
 'out of line because you will often have to see a flop If these unafraid '
 'players are on your direct left it is probably smart to play a tight '
 'aggressive strategy waiting to pick them off when they get too frisky It is '
 'important to realize that you can have the largest stack at a table but not '
 'be able to do too much with it This often happens in turbo events where the '
 'average stack at the final table is around  or less If you have the largest '
 'stack of  or so and your opponents pick up strong hands even if there are a '
 'few short stacked players they will not fold This means that you should '
 'revert to a fairly default short stacked strategy of playing tight and '
 'aggressive while getting a little bit out of line when it makes sense In '
 'this situation having a large stack simply allows you to lose a few more '
 'pots than your opponents before going broke When you have the largest stack '
 'by a small margin When you have the largest stack by a small margin such as '
 'when you have  someone else has  and everyone else has between  and  you '
 'have to figure out how often you will be raising into the player who has the '
 'second largest stack You also have to figure out the strategy of the second '
 'largest stack Your strategy should be completely different if you will '
 'usually have position on your secondstacked opponent and he is clearly '
 'trying to stay out of your way compared to when he has position on you and '
 'he is reraising every time you enter the pot If the player with the second '
 'largest stack is out of position against you most of the time you should',
 'position on you and he is reraising every time you enter the pot If the '
 'player with the second largest stack is out of position against you most of '
 'the time you should tend to play as if you are the only big stack opting to '
 'keep the short stacks around while applying pressure to the middle stacks If '
 'the second largest stack is being fairly active raising with what you '
 'perceive to be a decently wide range feel free to reraise him fairly often '
 'This will apply a ton of pressure allowing you to steal the pot whenever he '
 'doesnt have a premium hand unless he attempts an insane bluff For',
 'example if the second largest stack raises to  out of his  stack you reraise '
 'to  and he re raises to  you should tend to assume he has a strong hand '
 'leading you to fold You will find that some reasonably active players with '
 'the second largest stack will frequently fold to your aggression while '
 'others will not Be sure to pay attention to what your opponent is doing and '
 'act accordingly Some players with the second largest stack will play a '
 'supertight strategy when they are out of position against the largest stack '
 'If your secondstacked opponent almost never raises when he decides to enter '
 'the pot you should usually assume he has a decently strong hand and simply '
 'fold The fact that you have the largest stack does not mean you should '
 'blindly attack the middle stacks If the player with the second largest stack '
 'has position on you and seems to not be too concerned with moving up the '
 'payout ladder meaning he is not afraid to enter the pot once you have raised '
 'you should tend to tighten up When you know you will frequently have to play '
 'from out of position there is no point in raising with a wide range even if '
 'you can fire multiple barrels after the flop and apply a ton of pressure '
 'Anytime there is a loose aggressive player on your left your default '
 'adjustment should almost always be to tighten up your preflop raising range '
 'If the second largest stack has position on you but is tight rarely calling '
 'or reraising you before the flop steal as much as possible because your '
 'opponent is simply waiting for the short stacked players to bust before '
 'tangling with you One of the biggest mistakes you can make at the final '
 'table is to assume someone is going to try to outplay you whereas in reality '
 'he is straightforwardly waiting for strong hands hoping to move up the '
 'payout ladder Be careful to not make generic assumptions about the player '
 'with the second largest stack The only way you will get a feel for what your '
 'opponent is doing is to get a bit out of line Attempt raising with a wide '
 'range before the flop from various positions especially if you dont expect '
 'the shorter stacks to go allin or reraise too often If your secondstacked '
 'opponent plays back at you a decent amount of the time you should tighten up '
 'but if he doesnt raise as much as youd like Quite often when you have the '
 'largest stack there will be multiple players at your table who have roughly '
 'the same amount of chips as you such as when three players have between  '
 'and  and five players have between  and  When you are in this situation as '
 'when only one person has almost as many chips as you figure out how your '
 'opponents will react If it is clear they are going to stay out of your way '
 'raise relentlessly If they are not afraid to gamble with you tighten up and '
 'play a fundamentally sound game When you have the second largest stack When '
 'you are significantly shorter than the largest stack it is usually a good '
 'idea to not get too involved with the big stack because he is the only '
 'player at the table who can bust you That being said if the player with the '
 'largest stack is not abusing his chip position you can take his role pushing '
 'around all of the players who are shorter than you It is mandatory that you '
 'quickly assess how the largest stack is playing If he thinks that he should '
 'be waiting around for the short stacks to bust so he can move up the payout '
 'ladder you should ignore him and raise relentlessly as if you have the '
 'largest stack If the tight big stack plays back at you it is usually smart '
 'to give him credit for a strong hand However if the largest stack is raising '
 'and reraising with a wide range you should not be afraid to get a bit out of '
 'line against him especially if he expects you to play a tight strategy Most '
 'big stacks will assume that the medium stacks are trying to outlast the '
 'short stacks So if you apply pressure they will',
 'assume that the medium stacks are trying to outlast the short stacks So if '
 'you apply pressure they will assume that you got lucky to pick up a premium '
 'hand For example suppose a  big stack raises to  from middle position You '
 'are in the small blind with  Everyone else has between  and  This is a '
 'reasonable spot to reraise if you assume the big stack will think that you '
 'simply must have a strong hand to reraise However if he doesnt',
 'care about your range and will blindly pile his stack in with his entire '
 'wide preflop raising range you should fold almost every nonpremium hand '
 'because you can expect to be pushed on if you reraise As stated earlier you '
 'should not mindlessly assume that your opponent will or will not play back '
 'at you Pay attention to what he is doing when he is faced with aggression '
 'and alter your strategy accordingly When you have the second largest stack '
 'by a small margin it is often a good idea to try to steal from the largest '
 'stack While you cannot bust him on any individual hand you can put a huge '
 'dent in his stack Even the most aggressive large stacks are not looking to '
 'get involved in a situation where they can lose a huge percentage of their '
 'stack For example suppose you raise to  out of your  stack with K  or any '
 'reasonable hand from middle position and the largest stack who is fairly '
 'active reraises to  out of his  stack from the button This is an excellent '
 'spot to reraise to around  This will usually force the large stack to either '
 'fold or go allin in which case you will obviously fold Either way you let '
 'him know that you are not afraid to play a meaningful pot This will '
 'hopefully induce the large stack to stay in line against you If you can '
 'apply a bit of pressure especially early at a final table and force the '
 'player who is most likely to give you trouble to leave you alone you will '
 'drastically increase your ability to force your will on your opponents It is '
 'worth noting that when there is someone who has a tiny stack meaning he will '
 'likely bust soon it is usually a good idea to avoid any sort of significant '
 'confrontation with the player who can bust you As stated earlier it is a '
 'disaster to go broke with a sizable stack when you are almost certain to '
 'move up the payouts That being said do not be afraid to make high risk plays '
 'if you think they are almost certain to succeed For example suppose you '
 'raise to  out of your  stack from middle position with J  or any reasonably '
 'strong hand and the largest stack with  reraises to  from the button There '
 'is a player at the table who has  You know that the largest stack is '
 'definitely capable of reraising with an overly wide range in this situation '
 'If you think you have a huge amount of fold equity you should go allin You '
 'could also consider calling  more and seeing a flop but you will find that '
 'unless you flop two pair or better you will have a difficult time getting to '
 'a showdown and realizing your equity because it is quite tough to call '
 'multiple bets with a marginal hand such as middle pair While you will '
 'occasionally go broke by pushing in this situation you will often make the '
 'chip leader play straightforwardly against you and you may even steal the '
 'chip lead from him When you have a medium stack When you have a medium stack '
 'most of the time your primary goal will be to get off the middle stack '
 'either by stealing chips from the other middle stacks or by busting the '
 'short stacks Just as there are numerous ways you can have a large stack in '
 'relation to your opponents you can also have a middle stack in numerous ways '
 'For example if you are  out of  players you could either be in great shape '
 'when you have almost as many chips as the two players with more than you or '
 'in fairly bad shape when the two players who have more than you have '
 'significantly more than you Your stack size in relation to both the large '
 'stacks and the short stacks should drastically affect your default strategy '
 'In general when you have comfortably more chips than the shortest stacks you '
 'are in decent shape When you have this specific stack size if you win an '
 'allin versus a large stack you will either be in a position to cripple them '
 'or you wont When you can cripple the large stacks it is usually a decent '
 'idea to apply pressure on them to see if they will play straightforwardly '
 'versus you',
 'position to cripple them or you wont When you can cripple the large stacks '
 'it is usually a decent idea to apply pressure on them to see if they will '
 'play straightforwardly versus you For example assuming the stacks are      '
 'and  if you have  some players with  or  will play straightforward against '
 'you because they dont want to risk losing a large pot before the three short '
 'stacks go broke Other large stacks will play blatantly crazy',
 'against you thinking you will not be willing to risk going broke before the '
 'shorter stacks without an overly premium hand In this situation I tend to '
 'base my play on both how the large stacks have played in the recent past as '
 'well as my table image If I have been overly tight and my opponents likely '
 'think that I am only looking to get involved with premium hands I will look '
 'for opportune spots to reraise the large stacks with a wide range just as I '
 'would if I had a premium hand If I have a tight image given the stacks above '
 'and one of the relatively loose larger stacks raises to  from middle '
 'position I will happily reraise to around  from late position with a wide '
 'range and see what develops If my opponent reraises I will fold and accept '
 'that a tight aggressive style is probably ideal If my opponents fold I will '
 'continue applying aggression until they adjust If you happen to raise to  '
 'and one of the large stacks reraises you to  do not be afraid to re raise to '
 'around  out of your  stack with the intention of folding if your opponent '
 'goes allin While the wildest opponents will make this allin with a wide '
 'range most players will assume that you must have a strong hand that you '
 'plan to call an allin with If you happen to have a wild image which will '
 'often be the case when you push over a raise with a weak hand get called '
 'then get lucky to double to around  or  it is usually a decent idea to '
 'tighten up Most of your opponents will assume that you will continue playing '
 'a wild strategy in hopes of quickly accumulating all of the chips at the '
 'final table This should lead you to play a relatively tight aggressive '
 'strategy at least until you have proven to your opponents that you dont plan '
 'to get too far out of line Once you have regained a straightforward image '
 'feel free to get well out of line That being said when you have this stack '
 'size in relation to your opponents staying out of trouble is usually a good '
 'idea at least until the short stacks either go broke or double up If you '
 'find that the players with larger stacks than yours are more than happy to '
 'play an overly tight strategy you should make a point to steal as many pots '
 'as possible effectively acting as if you have the largest stack at the table '
 'Make a point to lean on the players with shorter stacks as much as possible '
 'while still keeping the shortest stacks in just as you should do when you '
 'have the chip lead Of course if the large stacks are playing well you should '
 'make a point to bust the short stacks whenever you have a reasonable '
 'opportunity in order to ensure you move up the payout ladder If you have a '
 'stack size such that you cannot cripple the large stacks such as when the '
 'stacks are      and  and you have  it is usually a good idea to hang out and '
 'wait for the shorter stacks to go broke or double up Your main concern '
 'should be to outlast the short stacks which occasionally means getting a bit '
 'out of line in order to bust one of them Especially if doubling up a short '
 'stack would not cripple you do not be afraid to take nearly neutral equity '
 'situations because by busting the short stack you make it much more '
 'difficult for the large stacks to abuse you due to the payout ladder For '
 'example if a short stack goes allin for  from the button and the small blind '
 'folds to you in the big blind with  do not be afraid to call off with a '
 'reasonably wide range even if the short stack has been somewhat tight Due to '
 'your decent pot odds they will fluctuate due to the number of antes in the '
 'pot you should often call off fairly wide If the short stack is super tight '
 'only pushing  of hands you can call with the top  of hands ignoring payout '
 'implications If he is pushing  of hands you can call with  of hands Dont be '
 'afraid to embrace variance especially if the alternative is slowly',
 'call with  of hands Dont be afraid to embrace variance especially if the '
 'alternative is slowly blinding down due to the everpresent pressure from the '
 'large stacks While you should usually be looking to avoid the large stacks '
 'if there is an overly aggressive large stack who is raising every hand do '
 'not be afraid to go allin over the top of his preflop raise with a wide '
 'range if you think you have a large amount of fold equity For example '
 'suppose an overly loose aggressive player with a large stack of  raises to  '
 'from middle position You are reasonably confident that he is raising with a '
 'wide range of hands and that he will fold a decent amount of them if you go '
 'allin for your  stack Even if there are a few shorter stacks at the table it '
 'is probably a good',
 'idea to push with a wide range relying on your fold equity to turn a profit '
 'For a thorough discussion on this extremely powerful play I suggest you '
 'check out Secrets of Professional Tournament Poker Volume  If for some '
 'reason you do not think that you have much fold equity meaning that the '
 'loose preflop big stack will call your allin with most of his wide raising '
 'range you should wait for decently strong hands that will have around  '
 'equity or more versus your opponents calling range The payout ladder '
 'requires that you get your money in with much more than  equity If you study '
 'the math you will find that it is quite difficult to pick up a hand that '
 'has  equity against even a wide preflop range This will lead you to playing '
 'a relatively tight strategy until the short stacks go broke or double up If '
 'you happen to have a middle stack when there is a short stacked player at '
 'your table who is likely to bust soon such as when the stacks are     and  '
 'make a point to avoid any significant confrontation with players who can '
 'bust you Unlike when you were the large stack when you wanted to keep the '
 'tiny stack around when you have a middle stack you should make a point to '
 'try to bust the short stack with any reasonable hand especially if you do '
 'not expect to get reraised by a large stack For example suppose a player '
 'with  goes allin and everyone folds to you with  in the small blind You '
 'should probably call with a decently wide range even if the player in the '
 'big blind is the chip leader If you call and the chip leader reraises you '
 'can fold but at least the short stack will have to win a confrontation in '
 'order to survive Ideally when you have a middle stack you can call the allin '
 'then either play a headsup pot or play in a manner that gives you the best '
 'chance of busting the short stack For example the stacks are     and  '
 'Everyone folds to the cutoff who goes allin for  If you are on the button '
 'with  and both players in the blinds also have  you should call with a very '
 'wide range looking to check the pot down and bust the short stack If you '
 'bust the short stack you as well as the other  stacks will gain a huge '
 'amount of playability compared to the situation where only one player calls '
 'the short stack By cooperating with the other middle stacks you can '
 'drastically increase your equity especially if the player with a big stack '
 'is adept at applying pressure There is a lot to think about when you have a '
 'middle stack Sometimes a middle stack plays like a large stack and other '
 'times it plays like a short stack It is important to quickly identify your '
 'specific situation and adjust your strategy accordingly Always remember to '
 'factor your opponents playing styles into your adjustments because if you '
 'happen to misanalyze your opponents you could make an extraordinarily costly '
 'error When you have a playable short stack If you find yourself with a short '
 'stack at the final table do not give up hope Even though you may feel as if '
 'you are in a bad position quite often your opponents will be playing in a '
 'manner that gives you a decent shot at doubling up For example if there is '
 'an overly aggressive large stack who is raising every hand to abuse the '
 'middle stacks you can look for situations to push allin for between  to  '
 'over the large stacks minraise He will usually fold allowing you to slowly '
 'increase your stack It is important to recognize where you stand in relation '
 'to your opponents You can be the lone short stack with a chip stack that '
 'still has a decent amount of playability you can have a short but similar '
 'stack to someone else or you can have an extremely short stack Your strategy '
 'should be based both on your stack size relative to the other players stacks '
 'as well as their tendencies',
 'to someone else or you can have an extremely short stack Your strategy '
 'should be based both on your stack size relative to the other players stacks '
 'as well as their tendencies When you are the only short stack but are '
 'unlikely go to broke in the near future which is often the case when you '
 'have between  and  you are not actually in a dire situation As stated '
 'earlier if there are loose players raising with a wide range of hands '
 'attempting to abuse the players who are looking to move up the layout ladder '
 'you should aggressively reraise their wide preflop raises usually going all',
 'in With this stack size your primary goal should be to either steal lots of '
 'small pots or get allin with a decent amount of equity depending on the '
 'style of your opponents Suppose a loose aggressive largestacked player '
 'raises to  out of his  stack from middle position and you with the shortest '
 'stack have  on the button This is a situation where especially if you are '
 'bluffing or semibluffing I much prefer going allin compared to reraising '
 'small to  or  You should tend to go allin with a wide range including any '
 'pair any suited ace any two Broadway cards and some suited connectors Notice '
 'that I do not have much of a calling range in this situation If you reraise '
 'small you give your opponent the opportunity to either go allin forcing you '
 'to fold or call forcing you to play a postflop pot meaning you will often '
 'have to risk additional chips to have a good chance of winning the pot By '
 'simply going allin you make it impossible for your opponent to bluff you and '
 'you do not have to worry about difficult postflop situations Of course going '
 'allin will result in you going broke whenever the preflop raiser happens to '
 'have a premium hand but if you accurately assessed your opponents preflop '
 'tendencies as being loose and aggressive he should not have a premium hand '
 'too often If most of your opponents are playing a fairly tight '
 'straightforward strategy do not be afraid to make  raises coupled with small '
 'postflop continuation bets Even with a short stack if your opponents will '
 'let you run them over make a point to steal as much as possible When facing '
 'a preflop raise from a tight aggressive player you usually want a decently '
 'strong hand to go allin because you will have relatively little fold equity '
 'Suppose a tight aggressive large stacked player raises to  out of his  stack '
 'from middle position and you with the shortest stack have  on the button '
 'With a hand such as  or KJ you should almost always fold if you think your '
 'opponent is raising with a snug range that he will rarely fold to your push '
 'You should tend to only push your premium hands that do well against your '
 'opponents range such as perhaps  and better AK and AQ With slightly worse '
 'hands that still have a decent amount of potential such as all other pairs '
 'suited Broadway cards and strong suited connectors you should tend to call '
 'You will then be looking to either flop well or steal the pot after the flop '
 'when your opponent shows weakness If your stack was shorter you should tend '
 'to fold most of your drawing hands opting to push only with a tight range of '
 'strong preflop hands that will have some equity when you get called As you '
 'can see your opponents tendencies should be the main determining factor of '
 'your strategy It is also worth noting that if you have been either overly '
 'loose or overly tight you should adjust your strategy to take advantage of '
 'your image For example if you have pushed allin three hands in a row and '
 'pick up AA you should also tend to push it If you have been overly tight and '
 'pick up AA perhaps you should reraise small with it instead of pushing Do '
 'not be afraid to think creatively in order to maximize your expectation When '
 'multiple players have playable short stacks it is usually a good idea to '
 'play as if you were the only short stack Since no one is likely to go broke '
 'anytime in the near future you should simply play your standard game In '
 'general you should continue pushing around the players who are too loose and '
 'getting out of the way when players who are too tight show aggression It is '
 'important to figure out the goal of the other short stack If he is overly '
 'loose trying to either double up or go broke it is a good idea to relax and '
 'wait for him to accomplish his goal If he doubles up you can play as if you '
 'are the only short stack and if he goes broke you can also play as if you '
 'are the only',
 'can play as if you are the only short stack and if he goes broke you can '
 'also play as if you are the only short stack If he is playing overly tight '
 'clearly wanting to move up the payout ladder you should aggressively steal '
 'his blinds if the other players give you the opportunity If they will not '
 'give you the opportunity it is probably wise to revert to playing as if you '
 'were the only short stack',
 'When you have a tiny stack Once you dip down to around  or less you lose a '
 'large amount of your fold equity Due to this you either want to get your '
 'stack in as a favorite or as an underdog but with large pot odds It is '
 'important to not play too tightly when you have a tiny stack One of the '
 'biggest mistakes you can make is to go from a  stack to a  stack simply from '
 'playing too tightly When you get allin you will usually have around  equity '
 'at best meaning that you will double up to where you started  of the time '
 'and go broke the other  of the time Compared to this outcome you would '
 'clearly much rather get allin with  equity for  which isnt too difficult to '
 'do When you have a  stack you have two strong options available to you that '
 'will almost certainly allow you to profit When everyone folds to you in late '
 'position especially if the players yet to act are too tight you should go '
 'allin with a wide range The purpose of this is to allow you to steal the '
 'blinds with relatively little risk Of course you are risking your entire '
 'stack but you will not get called too often If you are folded to on the '
 'button with a  stack you should tend to go allin with almost any two cards '
 'However if you expect the players in the blinds to call your  push with an '
 'overly wide range perhaps because they think they should go out of their way '
 'to bust the short stack you should tighten up You will be able to figure out '
 'who thinks they are supposed to bust the short stack by paying attention to '
 'each players overall strategy If someone is acting as if he is the table '
 'captain and is not afraid to take large risks that is not a player you want '
 'to attack If someone is only playing premium cards you should steal his '
 'blinds as often as possible Your other strong play when you have a  stack is '
 'to go allin with a reasonably strong range when an active player raises in '
 'front of you It is important to realize that compared to when you have  you '
 'need a stronger range to go allin due to your lack of fold equity However '
 'hands such as  and KJ are perfectly acceptable to get allin with versus an '
 'active raiser due to the dead money in the pot For example assuming you are '
 'the shortest stack by a large margin if a loose aggressive player with a  '
 'stack raises to  from middle position and you are in the small blind with  '
 'you should tend to go allin with around  of hands which includes all pairs '
 'all aces all Broadway hands and a few suited connectors Of course some '
 'players are more active than others so this  range should be adjusted based '
 'on your specific opponent One situation that frequently comes up when you '
 'have a  stack is when an active large or middle stacked player raises and '
 'everyone folds to you with your short stack in the big blind If you think '
 'you have relatively little fold equity you can call with a decently wide '
 'range of hands that have potential but are not good enough to push allin '
 'such as K  Q  and   with the intention of checkraising allin whenever you '
 'flop some sort of equity after the flop You could also consider simply going '
 'allin on the flop especially when you flop a draw or a made hand that is '
 'susceptible to numerous turn cards Suppose an active player raises to  out '
 'of his  stack from middle position and you are in the big blind with   You '
 'should almost certainly call and see a flop If you think you have a large '
 'amount of preflop fold equity going allin is also an option but with your '
 'stack size you should tend to call If the flop comes     or  you should tend '
 'to checkraise allin While you will often be behind against a better made '
 'hand when you get called you will still have enough equity to justify '
 'getting allin especially given you will not be against a strong made hand '
 'every time If you flop',
 'to justify getting allin especially given you will not be against a strong '
 'made hand every time If you flop a marginal draw such as on  or  both '
 'checkraising allin and open pushing allin are fine options On boards where '
 'you completely miss such as  and  checkfolding is the ideal play As stated '
 'earlier it is usually a bad idea to wait for an overly premium hand when you '
 'have  or less because if you fold for too long you muck your chances of '
 'turning your relatively unplayable stack into a playable one However if you '
 'happen to find yourself with  which will occasionally happen after you lose '
 'a large allin you must look to either go allin stealing the blinds before '
 'the flop or get',
 'allin when facing a raise when you expect to have roughly  equity or more If '
 'you have a  stack blinding down much further is usually a disaster If you '
 'happen to get down to  or less it is usually a good idea to get allin any '
 'time you think you will have the correct equity in the pot in order to break '
 'even or turn a profit For example if someone raises to  and you are in the '
 'big blind with  you have to put your stack in with any two cards You could '
 'also call  more before the flop and fold when you flop absolutely no equity '
 'Amateur players consistently butcher this situation by calling preflop then '
 'folding to a bet when they actually have some amount of equity For example '
 'if you call  more with  and the flop comes  if your opponent puts you allin '
 'for  more you should almost certainly call off due to your amazing pot odds '
 'You should also not be opposed to sticking your stack in with any sort of '
 'hand that has reasonable potential when there is a raise and multiple '
 'callers Quite often someone will either reraise before the flop or bet after '
 'the flop shrinking the size of the field and increasing your equity For '
 'example if someone raises to  three players call and you go allin for  more '
 'It is not uncommon for the initial raiser to reraise resulting in a headsup '
 'pot This means there will be  of dead money in the pot giving you amazing '
 'pot odds You should be fine getting allin with any two cards when you can '
 'engineer situations where you will be headsup getting  pot odds or better '
 'When you have a tiny stack you will occasionally find yourself in situations '
 'where you should avoid getting allin in the near future because your large '
 'and medium stacked opponents are not afraid to go to war with each other '
 'despite your presence For example if every pot is raised and reraised by the '
 'large and medium stacks with the occasional large allin bet you should play '
 'a relatively snug strategy especially if there are other short stacks at the '
 'table or when the large and medium stacks have significantly more chips than '
 'you By playing in this manner you have to recognize and accept that you are '
 'going to win the tournament less often in exchange for moving up the payout '
 'ladder some percentage of the time If your odds of actually winning the '
 'tournament are fairly low there is nothing wrong with moving up a few payout '
 'spots A classic illustration was Glenn Cozens dramatic  payscale move at the '
 'final table of the WSOP Main Event in  when he folded his way into second '
 'place with a tiny stack See JonathanLittlePokercomglenncozen When you are '
 'the only tiny stack at your table you are usually trying to double up When '
 'there are multiple tiny stacks your goal is frequently to survive until the '
 'other tiny stacks either double up or go broke This is especially the case '
 'when the chip leaders have significantly more chips than the tiny stacks '
 'such as when the stacks are     and  If you have one of the  stacks you want '
 'to do your best to ensure you outlast the other tiny stack This often means '
 'engaging in a blinding out war with the other tiny stack You will find that '
 'very few players have the discipline to fold reasonably strong hands even '
 'when they have almost no chips They cant resist the dream of turning their '
 'tiny stack into a large stack If you maintain discipline you will often find '
 'that you can move one notch up the payout ladder with minimal risk '
 'Adjustments to stack placements While the number of possible final table '
 'chip stack configurations is essentially infinite there are a few specific '
 'situations I must address If you develop a sound strategy to address these '
 'basic situations you can ideally tailor your strategy to work reasonably '
 'well with all stack configurations All of the concepts outlined below assume '
 'that you have a stack with some postflop playability and that there are no '
 'tiny',
 'outlined below assume that you have a stack with some postflop playability '
 'and that there are no tiny stacks that will likely bust soon When the stacks '
 'are set up such that you have overly aggressive opponents on your left you '
 'should play a somewhat straightforward tight aggressive strategy This is '
 'because if you raise you should expect to face a large amount of resistance '
 'either by being reraised preflop or called and then played back at after',
 'the flop Of course do not assume that normally aggressive opponents on your '
 'left will blindly attack you It is also important to figure out how the '
 'players on your left view you If they assume you will only raise with '
 'decently strong hands you should actually raise with a fairly wide range '
 'because they will be unlikely to play back at you If you have unsuccessfully '
 'raised a few times in a row you should expect them to continue playing back '
 'at you meaning you should tend to tighten up and wait for a strong hand When '
 'you have overly tight passive players on your left when the action folds to '
 'you in late position you should raise with a wide range looking to steal the '
 'blinds This is a prime situation to increase your chip stack with very '
 'little risk While it is true that these players will eventually figure out '
 'what you are doing and play back at you you have no way of knowing when they '
 'will come to that realization For that reason you should steal from them as '
 'often as possible until they finally adjust Dont assume that they will '
 'adjust as soon as you would When there are numerous players with  or less on '
 'your left you have to realize that you are playing a form of poker where '
 'when you raise before the flop you will usually steal the blinds or face an '
 'allin reraise For this reason unless your opponents are only pushing with '
 'premium hands meaning you will be able to frequently steal the blinds you '
 'should raise with a range consisting mostly of hands that you plan to call '
 'an allin with This is because you should expect to be pushed on somewhat '
 'often As your opponents start going allin over your preflop raise with a '
 'reasonably wide range you should be prepared to call off a bit wider It is '
 'worth noting that if losing  would be detrimental to your stack such as when '
 'you have between  and  you should avoid aggressively attacking the  stacks '
 'on your left unless you expect to have a large amount of fold equity When '
 'there are overly aggressive players on your right make a point to figure out '
 'whether or not they will fold if you apply pressure either preflop or '
 'postflop If they will fold when you reraise unless they have premium hands '
 'you should reraise with a reasonably wide range If the preflop raiser calls '
 'your re raise you should tend to make a continuation bet after the flop on '
 'almost all boards If the preflop raiser will rarely fold to your aggression '
 'you should play in a much more passive manner unless you actually have a '
 'premium hand Here is an example assuming  stacks If you think the preflop '
 'raiser will fold to your aggression then when he raises to  do not be afraid '
 'to reraise to around  with numerous marginal hands such as A    or  If the '
 'preflop raiser will rarely fold to your reraise you should be much more '
 'inclined to fold A  and   You should still call with  attempting to flop a '
 'set Also be sure to take the players yet to act into account because they '
 'can easily change a reraising or calling spot into a folding spot When there '
 'are overly tight players on your right you should tend to rarely reraise '
 'when they make a preflop raise This is because their range should be so '
 'strong that you should not expect to have much fold equity either before or '
 'after the flop Instead look to call with most of your hands that have '
 'excellent postflop potential assuming you do not expect to get reraised too '
 'often by the players yet to act If you expect the players yet to act to '
 'frequently reraise if you call you should tend to fold most of your '
 'speculative hands If your opponents are only playing premium hands it is '
 'rarely a leak to simply stay out of their way because they will not steal '
 'the blinds often enough for them to make a profit in the long run When one '
 'specific player at the table is overly active you should figure out if he is '
 'capable of folding',
 'When one specific player at the table is overly active you should figure out '
 'if he is capable of folding to your aggression or if he is willing to get '
 'his stack in the pot with a wide range If he will fold to your aggression '
 'which will often be the case with intelligent loose aggressive players who '
 'are attempting to abuse players who are trying to move up the payout ladder '
 'you should reraise him a decent amount of the time If he is a blatant maniac '
 'who is willing to get allin before the flop with a wide range you should '
 'only apply pressure when you are happy getting allin It is important to '
 'realize that a hand such as  or AJ could easily be the nuts against a maniac '
 'whereas against a tight player these hands are marginal at best Always be '
 'sure to account for your opponents range',
 'When no one seems to want to invest money without a premium hand you should '
 'raise with an overly wide range of hands when everyone folds to you I have '
 'had the pleasure of being at final tables where it was almost certainly '
 'profitable to make a  raise with almost any two cards from almost any '
 'position when the action folded to me While this scenario doesnt come up too '
 'often occasionally when you find yourself with a massive chip lead and '
 'everyone else has a small chance of actually winning the tournament even if '
 'they double up you can pillage the table The possibilities of stack '
 'configurations and dynamics at the final table are almost limitless When you '
 'are fortunate enough to find yourself at the final table spend some time '
 'speculating about how your opponents are going to play and how they will '
 'react to you If you develop a solid game plan that you are willing to '
 'deviate from if it becomes clear that your assumptions were incorrect you '
 'will have a high chance of success Making a deal Whenever only a few players '
 'remain at a final table it is not uncommon for someone to propose a deal '
 'When a deal is made players usually get some amount of cash based on their '
 'current chip stacks In general making a deal is not a good idea unless you '
 'are getting significantly more money than you should based on an ICM chop To '
 'determine the value of your stack simply use one of the various ICM '
 'calculators online in order to determine the value of each stack In this '
 'section I will discuss why making a deal is not a good idea if you want to '
 'develop into a resilient poker player Before we move forward I want to make '
 'it perfectly clear that you should feel no obligation to make a deal with '
 'your opponents even if it is the customary thing to do at your local casino '
 'When everyone signed up to the tournament they agreed to the payout '
 'structure set by the tournament director Also there is nothing unethical '
 'about using superior knowledge of math and deal structures to present a deal '
 'that is better for you than your opponents You do not have to present or '
 'accept deals that are fair in a traditional sense In fact you should almost '
 'never accept a deal where you are not getting some sort of edge If your '
 'opponents desperately want to make a deal make them pay you for that '
 'privilege The main reason why you should not make a deal is because you need '
 'to get experience playing for extremely high stakes if you want to succeed '
 'at tournaments in the long term It is not uncommon for small stakes players '
 'to chop every time they make it to the final table When they eventually move '
 'up when they make a middle or high stakes final table they are often shocked '
 'to find out that no one even entertains a deal The small stakes player is '
 'now forced to play shorthanded and headsup versus opponents who have '
 'significantly more experience This gives the experienced players a huge '
 'advantage In order to gain experience playing for high stakes with very few '
 'players at the table you simply must practice You get realworld practice by '
 'not making deals If you constantly make deals with your opponents you will '
 'never get this experience You will find that the equity difference between  '
 'and  place money in small stakes tournaments is relatively insignificant in '
 'the long run whereas the equity difference in high stakes tournaments can be '
 'huge For example when playing in a local  tournament perhaps  place is  and  '
 'place is  You are only playing for  In a high stakes tournament the '
 'difference can be in the  range or more It is certainly worth gambling a bit '
 'when you are playing the small stakes games in order to get experience so '
 'you are not completely outmatched when you are fortunate enough to get to '
 'play for life changing money The main time you should chop is when the '
 'difference between the current payout and  place is',
 'changing money The main time you should chop is when the difference between '
 'the current payout and  place is legitimately lifechanging money Personally '
 'I would not chop for this reason because no amount of',
 'money that I could win from a poker tournament even if it was the WSOP Main '
 'Event would change my life in any meaningful way If you are playing for '
 'money that means a lot to you you are almost certainly playing too large '
 'meaning you made an error by entering the tournament If you want to succeed '
 'at tournament poker you must embrace variance You should also consider '
 'making an even deal when your opponents are significantly better than you If '
 'you know your opponents are strong high stakes professionals and you have '
 'never played shorthanded or headsup in your life you should probably try to '
 'make an even deal You will find that most professionals will not accept your '
 'deal meaning you will have to play The final time you should make a deal is '
 'when you can negotiate terms that are significantly better for you than your '
 'opponents based on an ICM chop There are numerous ways to barter in such a '
 'way that allows you to get a much better deal than you should The primary '
 'way players get a better deal than they should is by offering to use the '
 'Chip Chop method This method assigns payouts based on the chip stacks in '
 'relation to the remaining prize pool For example if there are four players '
 'remaining and there is  left in the prize pool  is   is   is  and  is  and '
 'the stacks are    and  using this method the player with  should get  of the '
 'prize pool or  Clearly this doesnt make sense because if they played out the '
 'tournament the most he could win would be  As you can see the Chip Chop '
 'method significantly favors the large stacks For this reason when you have a '
 'large stack you should often suggest that you use this method to chop the '
 'payouts That being said most players are catching onto the fact that this '
 'method is not the correct way to split the pot When you have a short stack '
 'you should try to offer a deal referred to as a Save A Save is when the '
 'players all take an equal amount of money off the table and play for the '
 'rest For example suppose you are headsup with  chips compared to your '
 'opponents  chips First place is  and  place is  When you are playing headsup '
 'ICM no longer applies because you are effectively playing a headsup match '
 'for the difference between  and  place money This means that you are playing '
 'for  Since you have  of the chips in play you own  of  which is  on top of '
 'the  you have already locked up giving you  in equity Your opponent owns  '
 'plus the  he has locked up giving him  in equity If you both agree to make a '
 'Save for  you each take that amount from the prize pool and are now playing '
 'for  You own  of  which is  Notice that by making this Save you now own  '
 'plus the  you locked up meaning you own  in equity and your opponent owns  '
 'in equity If you and your opponent agree to this Save you immediately '
 'profit  in equity The interesting thing to note about Saves is that most '
 'amateur players think they are a great idea regardless of their stack size '
 'They seem to love locking in a solid win and are not aware that when you '
 'adjust the payouts you alter each players equity As a brief aside in single '
 'table satellites players often make saves when only a few players remain '
 'usually taking back their buyin and playing for the rest When you have the '
 'largest stack avoid making Saves at all costs because they demolish your '
 'equity I have only chopped a few times in my life and I want to share the '
 'circumstances with you The first time I made a significant chop was in the '
 'Sunday Million online I was  in chips with four players remaining I dont '
 'remember the exact chip stacks but I had a decent amount less than the '
 'player who was',
 'remaining I dont remember the exact chip stacks but I had a decent amount '
 'less than the player who was  in chips I firmly demanded that I would only '
 'make a deal if I got as much as the player who was  in chips They agreed and '
 'handed me  more than the ICM numbers indicated Another time I chopped was in '
 'a  tournament at the Bellagio I was headsup early in my career against a '
 'world class player I had around  of the chips We were playing for a '
 'difference of about',
 ' which was not too significant for me at the time My opponent agreed to do '
 'an even chip chop which was perfectly fair but since  of the prize pool was '
 'in the form of a World Poker Tour main event seat he agreed to give me half '
 'of that Seeing how I only owned around  of that  seat I happily took the '
 'deal and pocketed  in equity I once chopped a small  tournament when four '
 'players remained I had  of the chips in play The chip leader really wanted '
 'to take home the trophy He agreed to give everyone an even chop with  of the '
 'remaining prize pool each if we would give him the trophy We all happily '
 'agreed Finally I recently chopped a  buyin turbo event I got headsup with '
 'around  of the chips in play against an excellent online player who at his '
 'peak was ranked  in the world We both had to play the main event of the '
 'tournament series the next day and it was already midnight In order to '
 'simply go to sleep and avoid an effectively neutral flip we decided to make '
 'a fair deal and call it a night We ran one hand allin blind to see who would '
 'get the trophy His J  beat my Q  If I didnt have to play the main event the '
 'next day I would have certainly played but since I know sleep is important '
 'to me I made the deal I hope you have learned a bit about dealmaking When in '
 'doubt especially if you think your opponent is trying to get the best of you '
 'but you dont quite understand how simply do not make a deal and play out the '
 'tournament More often than not the experience you gain will be well worth '
 'the potential fluctuations of your bankroll The endgame Shorthanded A high '
 'percentage of amateur players are deathly afraid of playing shorthanded It '
 'is not uncommon to see players in cash games refuse to play until at least '
 'six or seven players are seated at the table They realize that they cannot '
 'sit around and wait for premium hands but they are unwilling to actually '
 'spend time learning to play with holdings that are historically thought to '
 'be marginal If you want to quickly improve your skills at holdem I strongly '
 'suggest you spend some time playing both shorthanded and headsup Both of '
 'these formats will force you to get out of your comfort zone and play '
 'speculative hands You will learn how to play against wide ranges instead of '
 'only a few strong holdings If you get experience in these formats when you '
 'are forced to play them for huge amounts of money at a final table you will '
 'be prepared I am not going to discuss actually playing shorthanded poker in '
 'this section because that topic could fill numerous books The key to '
 'shorthanded play is that you should play as if you were at a fullhanded '
 'table and the players in front of you folded around to you For example '
 'playing from the cutoff in a  handed game when everyone folds around to you '
 'is very similar to playing from the cutoff in a  game Constantly ask '
 'yourself what your opponents are likely to do if you take a specific action '
 'and then adjust your play to put yourself in simple yet profitable '
 'situations Headsup It is important that you spend some time learning to play '
 'headsup because when you have to play this format in a tournament you are '
 'usually playing for a large amount of money Suppose you are playing for  the '
 'difference between  and  at the end of a large regional poker tournament You '
 'and',
 'your opponent both have  As you should now know you both own  in equity '
 'However if you are skilled at headsup and your opponent has never played it '
 'before you could perhaps win as often as  of the time meaning you actually '
 'own  out of the  in play In this situation simply being skilled at the game '
 'has profited you  in equity While it is often difficult to have an edge that '
 'large it is not uncommon for a skilled player to win around  of the time If '
 'you spend some time learning this format and you make the final table in one '
 'decentsized event you could profit a large amount of equity This is a format '
 'you need to at least become competent at if you want to maximize your '
 'profits in poker tournaments In general when in position on the button you '
 'want to play a fairly loose aggressive strategy raising with an overly wide '
 'range When out of position you will usually want to play a tighter strategy '
 'electing to call or fold with most of your hands that dont have too much '
 'potential It is important to figure out your opponents strategy While the '
 'information you gather throughout the final table is certainly relevant you '
 'have to realize that some players have almost no headsup experience meaning '
 'their general strategy can change drastically once they reach this stage of '
 'the event For example I have played numerous final tables where my headsup '
 'opponent has been fairly tight and aggressive leading up to the headsup '
 'portion but once headsup they became blatantly wild While you should usually '
 'assume that a players prior actions will give you some indication about '
 'their future actions be aware that some players simply have no clue how to '
 'adjust to playing oneonone If you find yourself against a player who you '
 'think has very little headsup experience it is a good idea to try to figure '
 'out what type of errors he is likely to make Perhaps the most egregious '
 'error that these inexperienced players commit is to fold too often before '
 'the flop or on the flop to a standard continuation bet These players usually '
 'wait until they have a hand they view as reasonable before committing '
 'significant chips to the pot This allows you to raise and make a '
 'continuation bet with almost any two cards from the button Against this type '
 'of player you will find that you will steal the pot way more often than you '
 'see the turn If you happen to find yourself on the turn versus an opponent '
 'who you think doesnt get too out of line it is usually a good idea to give '
 'up unless you actually have a premium hand that you can continue with Some '
 'of these inexperienced players will realize that it is fairly difficult to '
 'make a decent made hand and will subsequently overvalue any reasonable '
 'holding For example some players see a hand such as A  before the flop and '
 'think it is the nuts reraising and piling their stack in These same players '
 'also usually overvalue marginal postflop hands such as  on  If you find '
 'yourself against one of these players there is nothing wrong with playing a '
 'fundamentally sound strategy while waiting for a spot where your opponent '
 'has a marginal hand and you have a strong hand That being said if you fold '
 'to your opponents aggression for too long your opponent could quickly blind '
 'you down You simply cannot win if you fold every time you do not have a '
 'strong hand Learning to play headsup is a lifelong endeavor I strongly '
 'suggest that you spend some time learning to play it before your next poker '
 'tournament Headsup is easy to get experience at because all you need is one '
 'other player some chips and a deck of cards Ideally you can find either a '
 'poker friend or a family member who will practice with you on a regular '
 'basis If you make a point to study the game when you find yourself playing '
 'for the big bucks you will be well prepared allowing you to at least hold '
 'your own and perhaps crush your opponent',

 ' PLAYING HEADSUP Introduction In the attempt to solve poker headsup is '
 'probably the best place to start You only have one opponent so your options '
 'are much more limited compared to when you are at a table with eight or nine '
 'other players The best headsup players in the world have varying strategies '
 'which implies that they disagree on what they think is good play Most top '
 'players are trying to come up with a theoretically correct strategy but no '
 'one has yet to fully achieve this goal In this chapter I will give my '
 'approach to playing headsup one which has worked for me throughout my poker '
 'career I am by no means claiming that this is the only way to play headsup '
 'or even necessarily the best way This is simply how I play and approach the '
 'game To best illustrate the strategies I use in headsup poker Ill use some '
 'hand examples that I find interesting and instructive You will notice that '
 'many of the hand examples present marginal situations where you could vary '
 'your strategy in various ways I purposefully chose difficult spots so you '
 'can see how I play when the decisions are somewhat unclear If for example I '
 'suggest that you call with a hand such as middle pair that implies that I '
 'would call with all better hands as well If instead I fold a hand such as '
 'top pair that implies that I would fold all worse hands Bet sizing Button '
 'raise sizing typically ranges from a minraise of  to a potsized raise of  a '
 'relatively narrow range Standard postflop bet sizing in single raised pots '
 'varies anywhere from  to  of the pot a much wider range Most of the '
 'theoretical variation in flop and turn bet size comes from the texture of '
 'board and the relative strength of players ranges but that is too broad and '
 'complex a topic to be comprehensively covered here For the sake of '
 'simplicity I will use relatively consistent bet sizing throughout the hand '
 'examples in this chapter Button raises will be to  flop bets will also be   '
 'of the pot turn bets will be   of the pot and river bets will be   of the '
 'pot There are of course plenty of good reasons to vary bet sizing depending '
 'on a number of factors including opponent style hand strength and your image '
 'but I dont think simplifying betting strategy in this way does much harm to '
 'an overall strategy I even employ this simplified betting strategy very '
 'often in my own games Illustrative hands Hand ',
 'Hero is on the button which is also the small blind when playing headsup '
 'with   He minraises to  with  effective stacks Villain defends from the big '
 'blind which means he is going to be out of position throughout the hand It '
 'is important to note that the big blind goes last preflop but must act first '
 'postflop The flop is    Villain checks This is a standard continuation '
 'betting spot for Hero He has a good amount of equity on the flop with his '
 'flush draw he is in position and he was the preflop aggressor Heros hand '
 'doesnt have any real showdown value so winning the pot on the flop with a '
 'single bet is a good result Depending on how the board runs out this hand '
 'might actually turn out be a good hand to bet with on all three streets By '
 'the river this hand will be in one of three categories but two main ones It '
 'will either be a strong enough hand to bet three times for value usually a '
 'flush or a hand that has shown aggression throughout but has very little '
 'chance to actually win the pot at showdown  Occasionally this hand will be a '
 'pair of nines or sixes at the river and will be a bet or check depending on '
 'earlier action It is important to consider the way a hand will likely play '
 'out on future streets when deciding whether to bet or check the flop Hero '
 'bets   pot Villain calls The turn is     Villain checks again This is a '
 'pretty good card for Hero First and foremost it adds a gutshot straight draw '
 'to the flush draw increasing the number of cards that will make his hand '
 'very strong Secondly it is a card that is unlikely to have helped Villain '
 'There arent many hands that Villain calls with on the flop that this card '
 'directly helps The main contenders are    and  This is simply not many '
 'combinations of hands out of the total number of likely hands Villain calls '
 'with on the flop I would bet on most turn cards but the  is a particularly '
 'good one for Hero The turn cards I would consider checking are A and  The '
 'main reason I would consider checking them is because I know my own range '
 'and I know that Ahigh and middle pair are hands I would likely have checked '
 'on the flop so they are less likely to be in my range when I have '
 'continuation bet the flop Also both middle pair and A high are likely hands '
 'for my opponent to have checkcalled with on the flop meaning a turned A or  '
 'is much more likely to improve my opponents hand than mine when the flop '
 'goes checkbetcall Hero bets   pot Villain calls The river is     J Villain '
 'checks Now that there are no more cards to come Hero knows that he cant win '
 'with  and has to decide whether he should bluff or not The J is a great card '
 'for Hero to bluff It completes a number of semi bluffs such as     and flush '
 'draws with a jack that Hero would have bet with on the flop and the turn '
 'Besides the flush draws with a jack none of these hands are likely to be in '
 'Villains range The jack is only likely to help Villain if it gives him '
 'twopair which as with the  on the turn is simply not a lot of combinations '
 'of hands Given all of this   is a good hand to bet with on the river as a '
 'bluff As stated at the beginning of this chapter my river bets tend to be '
 'around  of the pot in this case  It is important when coming up with a river '
 'betting strategy that you maintain a reasonable ratio between strong hands '
 'and bluffs There are many factors that will affect what the ratio should be '
 'including bet size run out of the board player styles game flow etc There '
 'can even be some extreme situations where the best decision will be to never '
 'bluff or to bluff with your entire range In general if you have too many '
 'bluffs in your range your opponents can exploit you by both calling lighter '
 'and winning huge pots with big hands if you have too few bluffs in your '
 'range your opponents can exploit',
 'you by both only calling with strong hands and by winning pots with weak '
 'made hands that have gotten to showdown cheaply Conceptually when I am '
 'trying to decide if I should bluff or not hands that are in the bottom '
 'portion of my range are prime candidates since they have no showdown value '
 'Hand  Hero is in the big blind with  effective with A  Villain minraises '
 'from the button Hero has two realistic options in this situation calling '
 'and   is better than Villains average hand and putting more money into the '
 'pot with a stronger hand has some value Also Hero has an ace blocker which '
 'makes it less likely Villain has a strong hand Whenever you have an ace in '
 'your hand it is less likely that Villain has AK AQ AJ etc That being said '
 'there are two main reasons to not  bet with Ax hands The first is that when '
 'you are called you usually fail to hit an ace on the flop making this type '
 'of hand difficult to play out of position Secondly when you happen to hit an '
 'ace you will generally often either win a small pot when Villain has nothing '
 'or run the risk of losing a big pot when Villain has a better hand This is '
 'called reverse implied odds and is a wellknown concept in poker but it is '
 'still important to make clear here Hero calls The flop is    There might be '
 'a viable leading strategy for Hero but I have yet to come across one I '
 'advocate checking to the raiser with your entire range staying in the rhythm '
 'of the hand This makes it impossible for Villain to deduce anything about '
 'your range Taking situations that are complex and reducing that complexity '
 'as much as possible without sacrificing value is an extremely important '
 'skill that will help you avoid making unnecessary errors In general when out '
 'of position I simply check to the raiseraggressor and see what develops Hero '
 'checks Villain bets   pot It should be clear that folding is not an option '
 'Heros hand is too strong There are a few benefits to checkraising Assuming '
 'that Villain is opening a wide range from the button and continuation '
 'betting a relatively high percentage of the time  is likely to be the best '
 'hand at the moment Moreover there are many turn and river cards that are bad '
 'for your hand so checkraising and potentially winning the pot on the flop '
 'allows you to avoid seeing bad cards on future streets However checkraising '
 'also has some serious downsides If your opponent has a better hand '
 'unnecessarily increasing the pot size is clearly not in your interest '
 'Additionally checkraising removes most of your opponents weak hands from his '
 'range taking away his bluffing potential It is also quite difficult to '
 'balance both a checkcalling range and a checkraising range at the same time '
 'For all of those reasons I prefer just calling on the flop Hero calls The '
 'turn is     Hero checks for the same reasons as on the flop Villain bets   '
 'pot Checkraising is bad because Heros hand is too strong to bluff with and '
 'too weak to checkraise for value Folding is also too weak because Villain '
 'will be betting many semibluffs and potentially even some worse hands for '
 'value Hero calls River is     K Hero checks for the same reasons as on the '
 'flop and turn Villain bets   pot',
 'Heros two main options are fold or call One way to approach these river '
 'decisions is to simply look at the odds youre getting and compare them to an '
 'assumed range from your opponent Villain bet  of the pot giving Hero  pot '
 'odds meaning Hero needs to win  of the time to break even We can reasonably '
 'assume Villain is never betting a worse hand for value so we need to figure '
 'out if Villain is bluffing at least  of the time If he is Hero should call '
 'if not he should fold Lets assume the weakest hand Villain bets for value '
 'is  this is referred to as the bottom of his value betting range This '
 'includes backdoor flushes and some of the two pair combinations However lets '
 'assume Villain doesnt raise preflop with  and  and checks  on the flop '
 'slightly weakening his value range That leaves Villain with approximately  '
 'combinations of value hands Most of Villains bluffs will be missed straight '
 'draws If we include all possible straight draws that comes out to '
 'approximately  combinations of bluff hands This means that Villain is '
 'bluffing around  of the time so Hero should clearly call Even if we dont '
 'think Villain will bluff with all of these straight draws and remove  of '
 'them that leaves us with around  bluffing hands which is over  bluffs Even '
 'then Hero should still call Different Villains will have different bluffing '
 'frequencies and part of the challenge of the game is learning how to assess '
 'your particular Villain As an aside checkraising the river is technically an '
 'option but I wouldnt consider it without the A in my hand Hero will '
 'occasionally have a strong enough hand to checkraise usually a backdoor '
 'flush so it makes sense to also have a checkraise bluffing range The A is '
 'the perfect card for Hero to have in his hand when he bluffs since it '
 'ensures Villain doesnt have the nuts Hand  Hero is in the small blind with  '
 'effective stacks and   Hero minraises Villain  to  Lets analyze Heros '
 'options  is of course possible and should always at least be considered when '
 'facing a  this deep because if you only  with premium hands youll be easy to '
 'play against This stack size lends itself pretty well to  since Hero can  to '
 'between  and  and effectively put Villain to the test for all of his chips '
 'It will be difficult for Villain to construct a wide profitable range with '
 'which to call  of his stack out of position This will result in Villain '
 'mostly either going allin or folding when facing a  in this spot That being '
 'said   isnt a great choice of hand to  with I would much prefer to choose a '
 'hand that had an important blocker card such as a ragged ace eg  or  or even '
 'a king Firstly it would decrease the probability that Villains  was for '
 'value Second these blocker cards also have the ability to make strong '
 'onepair hands in the rare case that they do get called What about folding '
 'This is Villainspecific but there is realistically only one type of Villain '
 'that I would consider folding this hand to given these stacks and the  size '
 'Some players  incredibly rarely When they do it is almost entirely for value '
 'Their range is something like  AJs KQ Against a range that strong   is in '
 'very bad shape However most players especially good ones will  a '
 'considerably wider range than this How their range differs from the above '
 'range can vary but there are a few general categories of hands players will '
 'add One consists of  bluffs They are hands that fall just below the standard '
 'of calling If a player is playing  of his hands from the big blind using the '
 'strategy of  bluffing hands that are not quite good enough to call a preflop '
 'minraise this implies he is  junky hands like  ',
 'not quite good enough to call a preflop minraise this implies he is  junky '
 'hands like      in addition to his value hands This is a particularly '
 'effective strategy versus opponents who dont call  too often Another '
 'category of hands players typically add to their  ranges are suited '
 'connectors such as',
 '  and   These hands play well postflop and provide board coverage This means '
 'they help strengthen a players range on typically unfavorable boards like  '
 'and  The final way a player might typically widen his  range from the '
 'original tight range described is simply to widen the value standard Instead '
 'of  only KQo they might   Instead of A Js they might   This is a '
 'particularly effective strategy versus opponents who call a lot of  bets '
 'Against all of these  strategies the equity of   rises at least  and becomes '
 'worth a call Hero calls Flop is A   Villain bets   pot Folding is too weak '
 'Hero has a pair and a backdoor flush draw and though Villain will have hit '
 'this flop with a lot of his range he will also likely continuation bet this '
 'flop with most if not all of his hands that completely miss Raising has some '
 'value It protects the weak pair of fours from overcards on the turn and is '
 'one of the weakest hands Hero will continue with giving it some theoretical '
 'appeal raising with the top and bottom of ones range However for many of the '
 'same reasons I preferred checkcalling over checkraising on the flop in Hand  '
 'with  I prefer just calling here One important difference here is that Hero '
 'is in position but if anything that makes me prefer a call even more Hero '
 'calls Turn is A    Villain bets   pot The turn bet size is a little smaller '
 'than in the previous hands This is mostly because it is a  pot where sizing '
 'tends to be smaller and because the effective stack size on the turn is  so '
 'a  turn bet sets up nicely and implies a   pot river shove Since Hero has '
 'picked up a flush draw to go along with his pair it should be obvious that '
 'Hero should never fold Some players might be tempted to raise allin after '
 'turning more equity but this is clearly inferior to calling Villain will '
 'fold very few better hands than Heros and when Villain calls and Hero misses '
 'Hero will lose  more than if he had just called and then folded to a river '
 'bet Hero calls River is A     Villain goes allin for   pot Since Villain is '
 'allin Hero has only two options fold or call There are numerous ways to '
 'think about river play One is the straightforward pot odds calculation we '
 'did in Hand  Try to come up with a reasonable range for Villain to have in '
 'this situation and replicate the calculation shown in Hand  This will be a '
 'helpful exercise to reinforce important concepts to keep in mind when '
 'getting to the river Sometimes though ranges and frequencies can be '
 'difficult to estimate One general rule of thumb I have found helpful is that '
 'when you have the top or near the top of your range in a particular spot you '
 'should probably bet for value or at least call a bet Viceversa if you have '
 'the bottom or near the bottom of your range you should probably fold or if '
 'given the opportunity at least consider bluffing   on this run out is near '
 'the bottom of Heros range Q J might be the actual bottom Unless Hero has '
 'some incredibly reliable physical or timing read or unless Villain is an '
 'absolute maniac folding   is the best play Hand  The following hand further '
 'illustrates river calling based on where your hand is in your range This '
 'hand is from the  buyin super high roller event at the PokerStars Caribbean '
 'Adventure played in ',
 'We were  and Andrew Robl raised from first position to  at  I was in the '
 'hijack seat with  I called the button called and the big blind called I '
 'started the hand with around  and Andrew had me covered The flop came A K  '
 'Andrew bet  into a roughly  pot Only I called The turn card was the A K  J '
 'Andrew bet  into the  pot I called The river was A K  J  Andrew checked I '
 'bet  into the  pot and Andrew went allin for approximately  more Andrew '
 'generally plays a solid tight aggressive strategy but is certainly capable '
 'of bluffing in a spot like this If he werent capable this would be an easy '
 'fold because even though  is an extremely strong hand Andrew simply never '
 'has a worse hand for value Capable however says nothing about frequency '
 'While I was thinking about what to do I was torn as to whether I should make '
 'my decision based on where my hand ranked in my own range or by trying to '
 'determine Andrews bluffing frequency  is very near the top of my range I '
 'could have  but I would generally fold that preflop or on the flop unless I '
 'had a backdoor flush draw I could also have AA or KK but I generally  with '
 'those hands preflop From that point of view this implies I should call with  '
 'because if I fold it means I will fold pretty much all of my hands making a '
 'bluff an incredibly profitable play for Andrew Based on the pot odds however '
 'I was getting about  which means that if Andrews bluffing frequency is '
 'under   is a fold This is certainly not a common bluff spot and though  '
 'might seem like a low bluffing frequency I think its actually very high for '
 'a situation like this I agonized over this decision and am still unsure '
 'about what the right play is I ended up folding and never finding out his '
 'hand The more I think about this situation though the more I think I should '
 'have called I think it is simply too important to try to minimize the ways '
 'you can be exploited especially when facing tough opponents Hand  Hero is in '
 'the big blind with J  and  effective stacks Villain raises to  Depending on '
 'the strategy you want to employ this hand can be played as a call fold or  '
 'For players continuing from the big blind with  of hands or more this is '
 'either a call or  As previously mentioned one viable  strategy is to include '
 'the borderline hands that are potentially too weak to call and  is good '
 'candidate Hero  to  Villain calls The flop is A   This is a situation where '
 'some players have a  continuation betting frequency but I prefer to check a '
 'number of hands that have marginal showdown value such as     and QQ or '
 'maybe even the weakest Ax that is in my  range Therefore my continuation '
 'betting range tends to be more polarized than many others consisting of '
 'strong hands and some bluffs Hero bets   pot Villain calls The turn is A    '
 'Our first task in deciding whether to continue in the pot is to try to '
 'determine Villains range A reasonable range to assign Villain after calling '
 'the flop is any pair or even a few unpaired hands like KQ or J  Its '
 'important to realize that simply because Villain has called our flop bet '
 'does not necessarily imply that we are up against top pair or better Given '
 'our assumptions about Villains flop calling range he actually has top pair '
 'or better a little less than half the time Since Hero wants to continue '
 'value betting all of his strong hands AJ and maybe a few medium strength '
 'hands ie JJ or  he should include at least a few bluffs in his range for '
 'balancing purposes I like  as a bluff mostly because it has picked up some '
 'equity in the form of a gutshot',
 'straight draw Hero bets   pot Villain calls The river is the A     A '
 'reasonable assumption for Villains turn strategy is that he will fold all of '
 'his unpaired hands and most of his lower pairs His calling range will '
 'consist of his strong  and all better hands I dont expect Villain to raise '
 'the turn with many hands for the same reasons explained in Hand  This is a '
 'river that very few people bluff It changes very little about the board and '
 'many players assume that it implies their opponents will call the river with '
 'their entire turn calling range If this was true however Hero would make an '
 'insane profit with his value hands which are all going allin on the river AJ '
 'Because of this Hero should have some bluffs in his range I suggest '
 'somewhere between  and  He must be very careful though because since he has '
 'very few combinations of value hands it is easy to have too many bluffs '
 'Keeping that in mind I would strongly consider bluffing allin with  The '
 'reality is that most competent players aware of this dynamic will fold a '
 'number of their weaker hands on the river to a third bet Keep in mind that '
 'even a hand as strong as  is really only a bluff catcher to a river allin '
 'from Hero Lets assume Villain will fold all of his  and even his worst Ax '
 'hands to an allin bet This leaves Villain with  to call the river making an '
 'allin bluff given our assumptions a profitable play Hand  Hero is in the big '
 'blind with A  Villain minraises from the small blind with  effective stacks '
 'The arguments for calling have already been established in Hand  There is '
 'effectively no difference between  and  Hero calls Flop is K   The arguments '
 'for checking were also already established in Hand  Hero checks Villain '
 'bets   pot This is a rare case where a legitimate argument can be made for '
 'all three possible plays by Hero My order of preference is call raise and '
 'then fold Folding is a reasonable option since Hero has only ace high and a '
 'backdoor straight draw but assuming that Villain continuation bets a '
 'relatively high percentage of the time I think ace high is just too strong '
 'to fold on a board this dry My outofposition headsup strategy doesnt include '
 'a lot of checkraising so I typically wouldnt checkraise with this hand '
 'However for players who like to checkraise quite a bit this hand is a decent '
 'option since it has some equity and is near the bottom of Heros continuing '
 'range Overall I think calling is the best option If you are concerned about '
 'having such a weak hand and being easily bluffable on the turn remember that '
 'our strategy includes playing all of our very strong hands this way as well '
 'so if Villain is bluffing too much our strong hands will more than make up '
 'for having to fold this hand on the turn when we dont improve Hero calls The '
 'turn is K   Q Hero checks Villain checks behind The river is K   Q  I think '
 'many players would be inclined to check and hope their hand is good if and '
 'when their opponent checks behind However I think bluffing is the best play '
 'When looking at my flop calling range I have',
 'pairs straight draws ace highs and a few strong queen high hands with '
 'backdoor flush draws like Q J Given this run out ace highs have become the '
 'bottom of my range All straight draws have either becomes straights or a '
 'pair of sevens and all queen high hands have become a pair of queens The '
 'bottom of my value range is probably a queen or a  If I am only betting for '
 'value my opponent can exploit me by folding all of his worse hands such as   '
 'and AJ Adding ace high hands to a river betting range as bluffs creates a '
 'more balanced range and makes it more difficult for my opponent to exploit I '
 'would bet the same size with all my hands in this situation for consistency '
 'around   pot Hand  Hero is the small blind with J  He raises to  with  '
 'effective stacks Villain calls The flop is Q J  Villain checks Unless Hero '
 'is continuation betting  of the time he needs to have a checkback range If '
 'Hero is continuation betting  of the time then he will have a weak hand the '
 'majority of the time This strategy is too aggressive and relatively easily '
 'exploited by Villain either by calling down lightly or checkraise bluffing '
 'Therefore Hero should have a checkback range The question becomes how to '
 'construct one In general I bet my strong hands approximately defined by top '
 'pair or better and most of my weak hands I check back certain weak hands '
 'mostly without backdoor equity and the hands in the middle of my range In '
 'this situation  would be near the top of my checkback range I might also '
 'check hands like   and  Hero checks The turn is Q J   Villain bets   pot '
 'Folding is out of the question Hero has too strong a hand plus a straight '
 'draw to boot I dont like raising Our hand is too strong to bluff and too '
 'weak to raise for value If Villain is bluffing we want him to be able to '
 'continue bluffing Constructing a balanced raising range would also be quite '
 'difficult Hero calls The river is Q J    Villain bets   pot Raising is again '
 'out of the question We have two pair but there are four cards to a straight '
 'on the board and our raise will only get called by a better hand Calling '
 'versus folding is relatively playerdependent Against the majority of players '
 'who we assume will have a reasonable turn leading range mostly based on '
 'equity I think this is a fold There are too few combinations of hands that '
 'did not improve enough to beat us on the river Turned diamond draws are '
 'obvious bluff candidates but even some of those have rivered a straight or '
 'have a pair strong enough to check Some Villains will semibluff the turn '
 'with a  in their hand and then decide that their rivered pair of  is strong '
 'enough to check but others will get to the river and decide to bluff with it '
 'The fact that we have a  makes this scenario less likely but it is still '
 'important to keep in mind when evaluating your particular Villain There is '
 'another type of Villain though against whom I would be more inclined to call '
 'Some Villains interpret a flop checkback as a weak hand and therefore lead '
 'the turn with a very wide range of hands They dont base their turn lead on '
 'equity but rather perceived weakness This type of player will end up on the '
 'river with a large number of unpaired hands that they will be inclined to '
 'bluff with on this scary card If you know that your opponent has too many '
 'bluffs in his range you simply must widen your call down range in a spot '
 'like this to include most bluff catchers such as ',
 'Hand  Hero is in the small blind with Q  with  effective stacks Hero could '
 'either limp or minraise Facing a minraise some Villains with this stack size '
 'will reraise allin with a lot of hands such as small pairs Ax and suited '
 'connectors but others will happily call and play postflop out of position '
 'Against the Villains who reraise allin with a wide range I would tend to '
 'limp in with  but against opponents who are more prone to call I would '
 'minraise Hero minraises Villain calls The flop is Q   Villain checks This '
 'should be a pretty straightforward continuation bet Hero has flopped a '
 'strong hand and wants to get value Hero bets   pot Villain calls The turn is '
 'Q    Villain checks Villains turn calling range should reasonably consist of '
 'pairs straight draws and potentially some A high hands that didnt reraise '
 'allin preflop On this dry a board I would expect most Villains to trap with '
 'most of their big hands like twopair or better This would conceal the '
 'strength of their hand and protect their weak hands from being bluffed by an '
 'overaggressive Hero on the river From Heros point of view there is some '
 'value in checking here with the intention of calling if Villain bets the '
 'river or betting if he checks Villain will likely bet a number of worse '
 'hands for value when the turn checks through and bluff many missed straight '
 'draws However I prefer betting The thinner Hero bets for value the more '
 'hands Hero can also semibluff with Assuming Hero bets most of his straight '
 'draws and turned flush draws he needs to also bet his top pairs for value '
 'Hero bets   pot Villain calls The river is Q    K Villain checks The only '
 'real question is whether Heros hand is strong enough to bet allin Some '
 'players might consider betting small on the river because they are confident '
 'their hand is best but dont think an allin will get called by many worse '
 'holdings The main flaw in this line of thinking has to do once again with '
 'balance Assuming that Hero doesnt bluff with this small sizing too often '
 'this strategy is easily exploited by Villain folding most of his marginal '
 'made hands We have tried to keep most of our betting sizes consistent so as '
 'not to be readabletransparent and those concepts also apply here Furthermore '
 'just as on the turn Hero wants as many value hands as possible on the river '
 'to offset his river bluffs Hero is presumably bluffing this river with a '
 'number of missed straight and flush draws so it is important to have a wide '
 'value range At the same time however Hero doesnt want to value bet too '
 'thinly For a river shove to be profitable a hand needs to get called often '
 'enough by worse hands to offset the times Villain has a stronger hand and '
 'calls The K river might seem like a scary card for Hero because its an '
 'overcard to his top pair but in reality its a card that doesnt help either '
 'players range very much and can be mostly discounted This allin would be '
 'close to the bottom of my value range but ultimately I think its a '
 'profitable play Hand  Hero is in the big blind with K  with  effective '
 'stacks Villain limps from the small blind',
 'This is another case where all three options are acceptable allin raise or '
 'check K  is a very strong postflop hand can make two strong onepair hands '
 'and can make straights and flushes I consider it a bit of a waste to take '
 'its flop potential away by going allin before the flop That being said '
 'against many Villain limping ranges this play would still show a profit '
 'Raising to  is also an option worth considering Any larger raise would be so '
 'large that most Villains would either fold or reraise allin creating the '
 'same issues just discussed Most of the value of raising to  comes from the '
 'dominated hands that Villain would limp in with and then call this raise '
 'like  or  There are two main downsides to raising One is that there are '
 'still a number of flops that K  will completely miss and it will be '
 'difficult to play out of position with this stack Another is that Heros '
 'checkback range will be weakened if he raises too many of these very '
 'playable hands whenever Villain limps On balance Im not quite sure which '
 'play is best and I know many extremely good short stack players who play '
 'this spot as a raise I even do myself from time to time For this example '
 'though I will play this hand as a check Hero checks The flop is K   Hero '
 'checks Villain bets   pot Hero flops a strong hand and can proceed by either '
 'calling or raising Raising has value because our hand is strong enough to '
 'get allin with on the flop It will get called by a number of worse made '
 'hands and will extract value from draws However by this point in this '
 'chapter it should be clear that I prefer to call It protects the weaker part '
 'of our range and keeps Villains bluffs in Hero calls The turn is the K   J '
 'Hero checks Villain bets   pot While this board has become even more '
 'coordinated I still prefer a call over a raise It keeps our opponents bluffs '
 'in and limits our downside when we happen to be beat River is the K   J  '
 'Hero checks Villain bets   pot The analysis of this situation is similar to '
 'the analysis of previous outofposition river spots A lot of it comes down to '
 'how often Villain is bluffing We will have some stronger hands in this spot '
 'to call such as  or  We could even have rivered a flush and raise allin  '
 'ends up being near the middle of our range but definitely in the top half I '
 'would always call on the river with this hand but I am used to playing with '
 'aggressive opponents online who have wide bluffing ranges There are '
 'certainly plenty of opponents against whom a call would likely be a mistake '
 'Hand  Hero is in the big blind with Q  Villain goes allin for  total from '
 'the small blind When facing an allin from a competent player the starting '
 'point strategy I use is based on the Nash Equilibrium This refers to a pair '
 'of strategies used by each player such that both players are playing their '
 'best possible strategy given their opponents strategy Any deviation from '
 'either of these strategies necessarily implies a loss of EV Once poker '
 'devolves into a shortstacked game you can take all of the guess work out of '
 'the game by following a Nash Equilibrium chart While Q  is not a great hand '
 'it is good enough to call an allin for up to  Its very important to note '
 'that this calling strategy assumes a specific shoving strategy from your '
 'opponent Plenty of opponents wont know the correct shoving strategy or will '
 'purposefully deviate for some reason Based on how they play differently from '
 'this baseline strategy it should be a relatively',
 'straightforward matter to adjust a calling strategy Below is the chart that '
 'outlines how many BB you can profitably call based on your hand and '
 'effective stack size when Villain is using a push or fold strategy from the '
 'small blind If your hand is too weak you should fold and if it is within the '
 'calling range you should call It is as simple as that Hand  Hero is in the '
 'small blind with  with  As when you are in the big blind with a short stack '
 'you can also play by using a chart when you are in the small blind with a '
 'short stack While the pushing chart states you can go allin for a large '
 'number of BBs with some hands such as QJo and  you will find that other '
 'plays such as limping or min raising are often better options However once '
 'your stack starts to diminish significantly perhaps when you have  or less '
 'especially when you have a hand that plays poorly after the flop such as  '
 'you should stick to the chart Since Hero can profitably go allin with  for '
 'up to  he should go all in when he has only ',

 'for which you should push The reason for this is that these hands are rarely '
 'dominated when facing a strong calling hand but once the calling hand '
 'becomes mediumsized they are too likely to be dominated Once the stacks get '
 'very short they are getting such good pot odds that folding would be too '

 ' GAME THEORY OPTIMAL STRATEGIES WHAT ARE THEY GOOD FOR Much of the reason I '
 'wrote Expert Heads Up NLHE was to explain the ideas of game theory a concept '
 'poorly understood in the community at the time to the average poker player '
 'Headsup nolimit HUNL is my game of choice personally so it made sense to use '
 'it as the primary example However HUNL is something of a simple case and '
 'there is a bit more to be said about how game theory applies to other games '
 'In this chapter Ill give a quick introduction to game theory as it applies '
 'to a variety of common poker formats Well see when its useful and more '
 'importantly when its not Well see when its appropriate to use game '
 'theoryinspired strategies and when this approach just cant really guide our '
 'play I promise to cover a practical skill or two as well Games strategies '
 'and GTO So what is game theory optimal GTO play First of all people tend to '
 'get hung up on the word optimal Imagine this theres some mathematician Shes '
 'made up some potentially useful concept with a moderately complicated '
 'definition and she wants to discuss it with other people What does she do '
 'Well first she probably needs to give her concept a name That way she can '
 'just say something like Suppose I have a continuous function fx instead of '
 'Suppose I have a function fx such that at every point a on its domain the '
 'limit of fx as x approaches a in the domain equals fa Much easier right Now '
 'dont worry you dont need to know anything about functions continuous or '
 'otherwise to read this chapter The point is that the word continuous wasnt '
 'made up from scratch it was a preexisting word in spoken English that means '
 'something only vaguely related to what the mathematician actually wants you '
 'to think about when you hear it The O in GTO is rather like that Theres a '
 'very specific technical definition for GTO strategy which well get to '
 'shortly We could have decided to call these strategies crunchy or yellow or '
 'Vulcan but hopefully game theory optimal is a little more evocative of what '
 'we mean even if it isnt perfect So please forget any preconceived bias you '
 'have about the word optimal In this chapter GTO means exactly the following '
 'no more and no less Suppose you have some players playing a game and you '
 'have a set of strategies one for each player such that no player can improve '
 'his EV by changing his strategy Then we say that any one of those players '
 'strategies is a GTO strategy for that player in that game Great In a minute '
 'well tease out some consequences of that definition such as what special '
 'properties such a strategy has etc But first if youre paying attention you '
 'might feel like youve been cheated I told you that GTO has a very specific '
 'technical meaning but then I gave you a definition that relies on more fuzzy '
 'terms game and strategy As you may guess we mean something specific by those '
 'terms as well Lets talk about those ideas and then come back to GTO Well '
 'also say something more about EV in the future Im going to tweak the next '
 'couple of definitions a little bit to make them more useful for poker For us',
 'a game will correspond more or less to a single hand It is composed of the '
 'following four things A set of players Starting ranges for each player A '
 'decision tree that describes all the possible sequences of actions that the '
 'players and nature ie random chance can take Payoffs that describe how much '
 'money or chips or value each player has at the end of the hand for every way '
 'the hand can end When we describe a game we will also usually want to '
 'specify the starting pot and stack sizes of each player although presumably '
 'we could find them by starting at the bottom of a decision tree at the end '
 'of the hand and working back up the series of actions to the beginning '
 'tallying bets as we go A players range tells us the different hands he can '
 'hold as well as how likely each of them is A players starting range is his '
 'range at the beginning of the game Of course a players possible holdings at '
 'the beginning of a holdem hand are well known so we often wont need to '
 'specify them However well sometimes find it convenient to set up artificial '
 'games that describe play over just part of a hand For example we could draw '
 'a decision tree that describes play on just a single river In that case well '
 'need to specify the ranges of each player at the start of river play to '
 'fully describe the situation I should explain what a decision tree is A '
 'picture works best see Figure  Figure  Top of a decision tree describing a '
 'hand with three players BU SB and BB This figure corresponds to a game with '
 'three players named BU button SB small blind and BB big blind There are two '
 'components circles and lines Each circle in the tree represents a spot where '
 'a player has to make a decision we call them decision points More '
 'specifically each decision point corresponds to a distinct set of public '
 'information the information youd have available if you were a third party '
 'watching the game with no hole card camera This is basically everything '
 'except the hole cards Ive labeled each point with the name of the player who '
 'owns it ie who gets to make a decision there Each arrow leaving a point '
 'represents an action the player can choose and when he takes an action the '
 'game moves to the point indicated by the arrow The game begins at the top of '
 'the tree Here Ive neglected to draw actions for posting blinds but',
 'theyre implied Then button can fold call or raise If he folds the small '
 'blind also has the options to fold call or raise If the small blind calls '
 'the action moves to a point owned by the big blind And so on Points all the '
 'way at the bottom of the tree which are reached at the end of a hand ie at '
 'showdown or after all but one player folds are known as the leaves of the '
 'tree Get it A tree describing all of the possible lines including all future '
 'streets and so on would be a bit unwieldy so Ive left dangling arrows to '
 'indicate places where much more lies below You can imagine how it would go '
 'So thats a game Strategy is another word that has an English meaning thats '
 'close to but not quite the same as its technical definition For us a '
 'strategy for a player is something that tells him exactly how to make every '
 'decision he could face in the game Practically it tells him for every one of '
 'his decision points and every hole card combination that doesnt conflict '
 'with the board how he will choose between each of the options available to '
 'him there Now we could imagine some fairly convoluted decision making '
 'processes but well generally restrict ourselves to one of the two following '
 'types If a player takes one action all the time with a particular hand at a '
 'particular point we say hes playing a pure strategy there and if he chooses '
 'randomly between multiple options with certain probability say fold  and '
 'call  then hes playing a mixed strategy Now if we know a players strategy we '
 'can find his range at any point in the game We have his starting range and '
 'then at each of his decision points he splits the range with which he '
 'arrives there He chooses an action to take for each component of his range '
 'If we know a players range for taking each action we can often more or less '
 'work out his strategy For example if we know he arrives at a point with   of '
 'a hand and his range for taking one action includes  of the hand and the '
 'other includes  then we can reason that at that point his strategy involves '
 'taking the first action  of the time and the second  of the time However if '
 'a player arrives at a point with  of a hand because his strategy is such '
 'that he never gets to this spot with this hand then all of his subsequent '
 'action ranges must also contain  of the hand His strategy by definition must '
 'dictate his play here but we cant use his ranges to figure out his '
 'frequencies So if we know a strategy we can find the ranges Furthermore if '
 'we know ranges we can work out parts of the strategy those that we might '
 'consider most important the parts that describe play in spots the players '
 'can actually get to when they play their strategies For practical purposes '
 'when we describe players strategies well usually talk about their ranges but '
 'to be clear theyre not exactly the same thing Great now were ready to '
 'revisit GTO in full force So again a set of strategies is GTO if no player '
 'can unilaterally deviate and increase his average profit An equivalent way '
 'to put this is to say that every player is playing maximally exploitably ie '
 'as profitably as possible given his opponents strategies So if all players '
 'but one in a game are playing strategies from a GTO set then the last player '
 'can do no better than to also play his strategy from the set A set of GTO '
 'strategies is also called an equilibrium or a Nash equilibrium and if all '
 'players are playing their strategy from an equilibrium we say were at '
 'equilibrium Lets take a look at one consequence of these definitions that '
 'many players find counterintuitive This isnt super important in and of '
 'itself but itll help us to become more familiar with the concepts A GTO '
 'strategy can involve folding the nuts even on the river Suppose were at '
 'equilibrium No player has any incentive to change his strategy Imagine '
 'taking',
 'A GTO strategy can involve folding the nuts even on the river Suppose were '
 'at equilibrium No player has any incentive to change his strategy Imagine '
 'taking Heros strategy in a spot that play never reaches and tweaking it so '
 'that it folds the nuts a small amount of the time By small here I mean that '
 'we dont start playing poorly enough so our opponents actually can improve '
 'their EV by switching up their play to arrive at that spot Then the tweaked '
 'strategy is still GTO since its still the case no player can increase his EV '
 'by unilaterally deviating Folding the nuts on the river doesnt affect our EV '
 'if its in a spot we never get to at equilibrium However if we did get there '
 'perhaps because Villain played a nonGTO strategy we could find ourselves '
 'folding the nuts despite',
 'playing a GTO strategy This is a pretty good example of how the normal '
 'English meaning of optimal conflicts with our definition Few people would '
 'call folding the nuts on the river optimal but such play is consistent with '
 'a GTO strategy By the way notice that in the previous paragraph we imagined '
 'constructing two distinct strategies for a player and we said both were GTO '
 'Indeed there is no reason to think that GTO strategies are unique and often '
 'theyre not This point will become important for us shortly GTO in cash and '
 'tournament play If all players are playing maximally exploitatively at the '
 'same time then none has any incentive to change If were playing at '
 'equilibrium and we decide to change our strategy we can only decrease our EV '
 'or at most keep it the same That much is always true it comes straight from '
 'the definition What else does GTO play do for us In some games playing a GTO '
 'strategy is enough to get some pretty strong guarantees not so in others '
 'Well look at three cases Headsup cash games Crowdplayer cash games '
 'Tournaments A crowdplayer game is one with more than two players These are '
 'sometimes just called multiplayer but multiple means more than one so thats '
 'never seemed quite right to me And as they say threes a crowd Anyhow for '
 'each type of game well start by imagining play at equilibrium and then well '
 'suppose that one or more of our opponents deviates Well be primarily '
 'interested in two things How much money we are guaranteed to make at '
 'equilibrium How itll affect us when an opponent deviates Again an opponent '
 'can only hurt himself by deviating but it would be nice if we could be sure '
 'that he isnt able to drag us down with him when were playing GTO Well '
 'neglect rake in all cases for simplicity Headsup cash games Lets call the '
 'average amount a player makes in any one hand his expected profit This is a '
 'bit different from what well call EV later In both cases expected just means '
 'average Expected profit depends on the game and strategies if we know those '
 'two things we can in principle calculate expected profit exactly A good '
 'player might expect to profit a few BB per  hands over time In a HUNL match '
 'between two evenly matched players the player in the small blind might '
 'average about that much Of course the big blind then loses that same amount '
 'on average because HUNL is a zero sum game the profits and losses of all the '
 'players in a hand add up to zero Again were neglecting rake It turns out '
 'that if we play a GTO strategy in HUNL we are guaranteed an expected profit '
 'of at least zero That is we are guaranteed to at least break even on average '
 'Furthermore if Villain makes mistakes it cant hurt us Those are pretty '
 'strong statements and helpful guarantees In my opinion those are the',
 'primary reasons we bother trying to find and play GTO strategies Why are '
 'they true The following argument may seem unnecessarily careful but its '
 'important to be cautious since much of this wont hold for other game formats '
 'As you read try to pick out which statements arent true for tournaments or '
 'crowdplayer cash games First even if there are multiple sets of GTO '
 'strategies in HUNL they all have the same expected profit for each position '
 'To see why consider two sets of GTO strategies call them A and B Suppose for '
 'the sake of contradiction that B is better than A for Hero his expected '
 'profit is higher there Then imagine the players begin by playing their '
 'strategies from A What would happen if Hero switched to B Then no matter '
 'what Villain did he could only be doing worse than or equal to that of '
 'playing his own strategy from B since that strategy maximally exploits Heros '
 'strategy from B And since Villains loss is Heros win switching to B '
 'guarantees Hero will win at least the expected profit hed get if both '
 'players were playing B So if A is being played Hero can improve his profit '
 'by unilaterally changing his strategy This directly contradicts the '
 'definition of GTO strategy so A cant be GTO Our initial supposition that '
 'there exist two sets of GTO strategies with different expected profits for '
 'Hero must have been incorrect Thus if there are multiple equilibria in a  '
 'zerosum game they all have to have the same expected profit for each player '
 'Furthermore if we have two GTO strategies A and B then any new strategy of '
 'the form play A sometimes and play B the rest is also GTO So in headsup play '
 'we can mostly ignore the fact that GTO strategies are not unique Any one of '
 'them is more or less as good as any other at least for our purposes in this '
 'chapter One could be better than another against some particular exploitable '
 'opponent but none is best against all opponents and theyre all the same at '
 'equilibrium In particular it doesnt really matter if we play a strategy from '
 'one GTO set when were in the small blind and a strategy from another when in '
 'the big blind Our expected profit in the small blind will be the same as '
 'Villains regardless and that win will exactly equal our average loss when '
 'were in the big blind Thus if we assume that we play the same amount of '
 'hands in the small blind as in the big blind at each stack size over time '
 'our average profit when both players play GTO is  And since Villain can only '
 'hurt himself by deviating and also since his loss is our gain in headsup '
 'play our playing a GTO strategy any GTO strategy guarantees us a nonnegative '
 'profit in HUNL Nice Now lets see how GTO strategies hold up in other games '
 'Crowdplayer cash games Lets add another player to the game and try the same '
 'sort of argument Suppose there are three players Hero and two opponents and '
 'two sets of GTO strategies A and B Is it possible that Hero has a different '
 'expected profit when all players play strategies from A than when they play '
 'B Well what happens if theyre all playing A and Hero unilaterally switches '
 'to B In the two player case we knew that the single opponent could do no '
 'better than to switch his strategy as well Here thats not so The definition '
 'of equilibrium tells us only that if all players except one play strategies '
 'from a GTO set then the last one would do best to play his strategy from '
 'that set as well So if two players here switch then the third should as well '
 'However when Hero unilaterally switches from A to B he may have simply '
 'lowered his profit and increased that of both of his opponents The lesson '
 'here In a  or more zero sum game theres no reason to think that distinct GTO '
 'sets lead to the same expected profit for each player Thus in game if one '
 'GTO set is being played when',
 'sets lead to the same expected profit for each player Thus in game if one '
 'GTO set is being played when Hero is on the button and another set is played '
 'when hes in other positions theres no reason to expect that his winnings in '
 'the first case will cancel his losses in the second Hero could be doing '
 'worse on the button or any position than his opponents are despite everyone '
 'playing equilibrium strategies in each hand In this case hed have no '
 'strategic recourse there is no way he could unilaterally change his strategy '
 'to avoid being a losing player',
 'In HUNL playing GTO guaranteed us a certain baseline profit in each position '
 'and the average of those over both positions was guaranteed to be '
 'nonnegative Villain deviating could if anything only make us more money Here '
 'we could be losing money on average over all positions More generally we '
 'cant really ignore the possibility of multiple distinct GTO strategies in '
 'crowdplayer games because some of them could be significantly better for us '
 'than others Speaking of a GTO strategy in these games as if its unique '
 'doesnt make sense There are real tradeoffs between them that need to be '
 'understood Furthermore in a crowdplayer cash game an opponents bad play '
 'could actually make us lose more money The definition of GTO play tells us '
 'only that his deviation cant help him In headsup play Villains hurting '
 'himself necessarily helps us Here however its possible that an opponents '
 'mistakes could hurt us as well as him to the benefit of a third party The '
 'headsup case where there is no third party is actually pretty special In my '
 'opinion the lack of a guaranteed minimum expected profit at equilibrium is a '
 'lot less damning than the fact that opponents bad play could hurt us '
 'Assuming good game selection the situation at the tables is hopefully that '
 'our opponents make lots of mistakes We can be happy enough about that while '
 'blindly playing a GTO strategy in a headsup game since Villains mistakes can '
 'only help us In crowdplayer games however Villain mistakes can drag us down '
 'too so blindly playing GTO is really not a tenable option We have to '
 'actively react to the table conditions in game Overall a study of GTO play '
 'in crowdplayer games is somewhat harder and also somewhat less useful than '
 'in the headsup case Now all is not lost Certainly a lot of the concepts that '
 'well learn by studying GTO play primarily in the headsup case can help us '
 'understand solid play in any game For one thing a lot of spots come up in '
 'crowdplayer games where there are only two players left in the hand In fact '
 'this happens in every hand In this case we can play strategies that are GTO '
 'for these twoplayer subgames and gain pretty much all the same benefits that '
 'theyd have in genuine headsup situations any GTO strategy will get us the '
 'same profit at equilibrium and playing a strategy from this set will '
 'guarantee us at least that profit no matter what Villain does Well get some '
 'more intuition for this later when we see how we might actually find GTO '
 'strategies Tournament play The situation for tournament play is '
 'unfortunately even worse Crowdplayer tournaments have all the same '
 'challenges as  cash games In tournaments however even the  subgames lose '
 'their nice properties Essentially this is because theyre not zero sum In a '
 'cash game once a hand is down to two players any value that one player wins '
 'is value that the other loses This is not the case in tournaments because of '
 'what are sometimes called ICM effects ICM is the Independent Chip Model It '
 'is well known that in tournament play the right decision isnt necessarily '
 'the one that gets us the most chips on average primarily because of the '
 'leveled payout structure Intuitively this is because getting all the chips '
 'doesnt mean getting all the money On the contrary you can end up winning a '
 'lot of money in most tournaments even if you end up with no chips just by '
 'lasting long enough Correct play is thus often more conservative in a '
 'tournament than a cash game For a properly bankrolled cash game player '
 'getting allin preflop on a coinflip is essentially a wash In a tournament '
 'its a disaster Half the time you go broke and win no money and half the time '
 'you double your chipstack but that doubling of the stack is associated with '
 'a quiteabitlessthandoubling in average payout To make strategic decisions in',
 'associated with a quiteabitlessthandoubling in average payout To make '
 'strategic decisions in tournaments we need some way to convert between chip '
 'stacks and expected payouts The ICM is often used for this Anyway because of '
 'these effects playing GTO doesnt guarantee that Villain cant lose us money '
 'by playing badly even once a hand is down to two players The classic example '
 'here is when Hero goes all in preflop If an opponent doesnt understand that '
 'he should be relatively unwilling to risk his tournament',
 'life then he could call too frequently This can end up costing both Hero and '
 'Villain money on average The lost value is effectively redistributed to the '
 'other players left in the tournament even though theyre not directly '
 'involved in the hand Against good players a lot of the ideas well find by '
 'exploring GTO play apply but we cant blindly follow GTO strategies even when '
 'hands get down to headsup because Villains bad play can still hurt us For '
 'example if weve identified an opponent as too willing to put money in the '
 'pot then playing with an equilibrium level of aggression against him could '
 'be pretty bad I think thats it for the bad news in this chapter Its all good '
 'stuff from here on The truth is that the benefits of GTO play are great I '
 'think their benefits in nonheadsup games have been exaggerated somewhat '
 'given that our opponents hopefully play far from equilibrium due to a '
 'misunderstanding of the factors that have been discussed so far But no '
 'matter what game you favor there is still a great deal to be learned from '
 'these ideas The reason derives from GTO plays close relationship to '
 'maximally exploitative play Of course its always good in poker to figure out '
 'what your opponents are doing and then play to make as much money as '
 'possible given that information GTO play simply means that all players in '
 'the game are doing exactly that simultaneously So even if the strategies '
 'themselves dont come with too many guarantees understanding them can teach '
 'us much about exploitative play in tough games Multidecision EV calculations '
 'To go further it really helps to be able to do some calculations A players '
 'expected value EV is the amount of money his stack will be worth at the end '
 'of the hand on average By on average I mean on average over all cards that '
 'can come out and over all hands Villain can have This convention isnt used '
 'everywhere  but its what well go with here Of course our EV with a '
 'particular hand depends in general on the strategies of all players in the '
 'game EV is a useful thing to be able to calculate because in poker we pretty '
 'much always want to take the action that on average leads to us having the '
 'most valuable stack at the end of the hand So when were faced with a '
 'decision between multiple options we can simply calculate our EV after each '
 'one and then go with the biggest Lets take a simple example to see this in '
 'action Suppose were playing HUNL both players start with  stacks and Hero is '
 'in the big blind with  Villain starts out by open shoving from the small '
 'blind and we estimate that he does this whenever he starts out holding one '
 'of the following hands             This is around half of all hands What is '
 'Heros EV when he calls and when he folds Which is bigger Give this a shot '
 'for yourself before proceeding Well Heros EV when he folds which well write '
 'EVfolding is easy Its  His stack size at the end of the hand is  on average '
 'and always because he started with  and then he gave up his big blind How '
 'about EVcalling When Hero calls he goes broke whenever he loses and he ends '
 'up with a  stack whenever he wins He wins about  of the time You can find '
 'this probability using an equity calculator like PokerStove So on average '
 'after calling hell end up with a stack of EVcalling chance he loses x stack '
 'size if he loses chance he wins x stack size if he wins   x   x  ',
 'Since  is less than  folding is better than calling Both actions lose Hero '
 'money on the hand overall but in poker money not lost is just as good as '
 'money won and folding on average loses Hero about  or  per  hands less than '
 'calling This EV calculation was pretty simple because Hero only had two '
 'options and the hand was over as soon as he acted However what if the small '
 'blinds raise hadnt been allin Then one of Heros options would have been to '
 'reraise and wed have needed to know how Villain plays versus that reraise in '
 'order to find Heros EVreraising Hero would also have had the option to call '
 'in which case wed have seen a flop with money behind Heros EVcalling would '
 'have depended on how the players play on all possible flops and future '
 'streets as well In general the amount of money well end up with at the end '
 'of the hand after taking one action can depend on play at many other '
 'decision points later in the hand Some players try to memorize opaque '
 'equations that purport to calculate EV However these usually only apply to '
 'simple spots like the callor fold scenario above they almost never take into '
 'account future action and theyre easy to misapply if we dont quite know '
 'where they came from So Ill show here how we can work out EV for ourselves '
 'for any spot Personally I almost never memorize any equations I just do '
 'something like this every time For simple spots it isnt really any harder '
 'than remembering a formula and for complicated cases like the one were about '
 'to look at it makes possible something that would otherwise not be Of course '
 'finding EVs is a very practical skill Any time we can estimate Villains '
 'strategy and we want to figure out how to make the most money against it we '
 'can use this approach Lets work in terms of an example that demonstrates all '
 'the important points For a somewhat more systematic approach see EHUNL '
 'Volume  Chapter  The first thing to do is to organize our thoughts by '
 'drawing a tree Thats the best way to nail down all the future decisions we '
 'might want to consider Of course there are sometimes tradeoffs between '
 'completeness and keeping the size of our calculations manageable Have a look '
 'at Figure  It shows a tree describing turn and river play in a HUNL spot Ive '
 'labeled each point with a number to help refer to it the player whose '
 'decision it is and a pair of numbers that show how many chips each player '
 'has in the pot at each point For example if both players check down both '
 'streets the game proceeds straight down the leftmost branches of the tree '
 'and the hand ends with both players having  in the pot If both streets go '
 'betcall we go right down the right side of the tree and end the hand with a '
 'total of  in the pot The turn spot were looking to model arose as follows '
 'Both players started the hand with  behind The small blind minraised preflop '
 'and was called The flop came A K Q both players checked and the  brought a '
 'flush draw on the turn At this point there is  in the pot and both players '
 'have  behind Figure  Turn and river decision tree modeling a spot after the '
 'small blind declines to continuation bet on a static board This means that '
 'two potsized bets get us allin Turn spots that arise following checkedbehind '
 'flops',
 'are very interesting and we spend a lot of time discussing turn leading the '
 'delayed continuation bet versus checkraise dynamic betsizing issues the '
 'consequence all those factors have for earlier flop play etc in EHUNL '
 'Volume  Here though well keep it simple and think about the spot as follows '
 'Having declined to continuation bet the small blind likely has a medium '
 'strength hand like bottom pair Better hands might have bet the flop for '
 'value and worse ones would have taken the opportunity to bluff The turned '
 'deuce doesnt figure to have changed the situation very often and so the '
 'small blind doesnt have much reason to bet on the later streets either If he '
 'did his mediocre holding would likely just get called by almost all better '
 'hands and fold out all worse So we assume that only the big blind will do '
 'any betting he can show up with many more strong value hands and weak '
 'holdings that need to bluff So the big blind has the option to bet both '
 'streets we fix his sizing at pot for simplicity and the small blind plays '
 'callorfold Weve also included only two possible rivers one which brings the '
 'flush and one which doesnt Well assume the flushing  comes  of the time and '
 'the nonflushing   The real numbers depend on the players holdings but an '
 'approximation is sufficient for our EV calculation Now suppose Hero is in '
 'the big blind with an air hand   Well do the left hand side of the decision '
 'tree together and youll do the right side on your own That is Ill show how '
 'to find the big blinds EVchecking on the turn and youll find his EVbetting '
 'and then compare to find the more profitable choice So lets work on '
 'EVchecking We need to start by estimating Villains strategy after we check '
 'Suppose he raises preflop checks back this flop and thus gets to this turn '
 'spot whenever he holds one of the following hands suited or '
 'unsuited                     On the left side of the tree the turn checks '
 'through so the small blind arrives at the river with the same range Suppose '
 'that on the offsuit river he calls a bet with any pair or better and on the '
 'diamond he calls with any queen or better Expressing those ranges as '
 'frequencies will help us A variety of computer tools can make the counting '
 'less tedious I used EDVis Taking card removal into account the small blind '
 'thus calls with  of  hand combinations on the diamond river and  of  on the '
 'spade So we want to play as profitably as possible with   after checking and '
 'we want to know the EV of doing so How do we proceed Well we start at point  '
 'Follow along on the tree in Figure  After checking we necessarily go to '
 'point  and from there to point  So our EV of checking is the same as our EV '
 'when we make it to point  At  Nature random chance gets to decide on a river '
 'card and we have no control over that so our EV at point  is  x EVat point   '
 'x EVat point  Youll recall that  and  are how often we decided each river '
 'card would come To evaluate this we need to go deeper and find the EVs at '
 'points  and  Lets start with  At point  we actually control the action and '
 'we know well go with whichever choice is better Thus our EV at this point '
 'isnt any sort of average of our EVs at the two following points  and  '
 'Instead its the maximum of those two EVs We write EVat point  max EVat '
 'point  EVat point  To evaluate this we still need to find the EVs at points  '
 'and  Once we make it to point  we always see a showdown There well capture '
 'our equity in the pot which happens to be  since we always lose at showdown '
 'so we just end up with the  that remain in our stack So we have EVat '
 'point    x   Now back up to point  which occurs after we bet the turn This '
 'is Villains point and we dont',
 'control his play so our EV here is an average over his two options  of the '
 'time he folds and we end up at point  with  The other  of the time Villain '
 'calls our bluff and we get to point  and end up with  Plug in to the '
 'equation for Heros EV at point  what is it  At this point we need to back up '
 'and find our EV at point  but the reasoning for the subtree below point  is '
 'pretty much the same as that below point  Im going to leave it entirely up '
 'to you to figure out the EV of betting the turn So if you want a chance to '
 'try a calculation and check your answer against mine try to find EVat point  '
 'before continuing So you see that weve sort of gone down the tree and then '
 'back up it in our reasoning The EVs at any particular point depend on the '
 'EVs of those below it Its only at the leaves of the tree which have no '
 'points below them that we can immediately write down the EVs More '
 'specifically at leaves which follow a fold we just ship the pot to the '
 'winning player and at leaves which represent a showdown the players capture '
 'their equity in the pot At nonleaf points that we control our EV is the max '
 'over all our options assuming we play maximally exploitatively At nonleaf '
 'points we dont control our EV is some average of our EVs after each of the '
 'options weighted by how often theyre taken To do an EV calculation I usually '
 'just start at the bottom of a tree and work up but starting at the top and '
 'working down shows the logic Its not entirely necessary but if we wanted to '
 'write our EVchecking on the turn all out in one big equation itd look like '
 'EVcheck   EVhaving   at point  EVhaving   at point   x EVat point   x EVat '
 'point   x max EVat  EV at   x max EVat  EVat   x max EVat   x   x   x max '
 'EVat   x   x   x max    x max    x   x   Notice that everywhere we evaluate '
 'the max function weve made a decision between options choosing the larger In '
 'this case in both river spots we chose  over the  and change corresponding '
 'to checking ie giving up on the pot rather than betting So now we know that '
 'the EV of checking on the turn is  assuming that whenever we do make it to '
 'the river that way we make the maximally exploitative play and check Come up '
 'with ranges for the small blinds play on the right side of the tree and find '
 'Heros EVbetting on the turn Which is better betting or checking  If Hero '
 'does bet the turn which rivers should he follow through on From EV '
 'calculations to GTO play Now lets take a look at one way to actually find a '
 'set of GTO strategies in general There isnt only one way but I find the '
 'approach were about to cover very intuitive as a poker player For '
 'convenience Im going to speak in terms of a  game The first step is to be '
 'able to find the maximally exploitative ME ie most profitable strategies We '
 'just saw how to make as much money as possible with an individual hand but '
 'what strategy makes the most money overall Perhaps unsurprisingly the ME '
 'strategy is just the one that plays as profitably as',
 'possible with every individual hand In other words we could find such a '
 'strategy by repeating the calculation in the previous section for every one '
 'of the  holdem hand combinations Also unsurprisingly its best to use a '
 'computer for this So now once we know the strategy of one player in a game '
 'we can find his opponents ME response It seems like we might be able to '
 'leverage that to find some GTO strategies since a GTO strategy pair is just '
 'when both players are playing ME simultaneously How so Well consider this We '
 'pick some strategy for Villain and then we find Heros ME response Then we '
 'find Villains ME strategy against Hero Then we find Heros new ME strategy '
 'against Villains new strategy And then we find Villains ME response to that '
 'And so on At first we expect both players strategies to change a lot at each '
 'step but is it reasonable to expect that both players strategies in each '
 'iteration might eventually settle down to some happy medium play where both '
 'players are maximally exploiting each other simultaneously What do you think '
 'It turns out that the answer is no that doesnt happen In many cases the '
 'sequence of ME strategies will just oscillate forever Perhaps Hero bluffs '
 'too much so Villain calls a lot Now Hero stops bluffing so Villain calls '
 'very little so Hero returns to bluffing a lot At this point were back to '
 'where we started so the cycle repeats thereafter However it turns out that a '
 'small tweak to this iterative scheme does work Basically in every iteration '
 'we solve for the ME strategy but instead of switching the players current '
 'strategy all the way there we just take a small step in that direction That '
 'is our new strategy is effectively to play the new ME strategy some small '
 'fraction of the time and otherwise keep using our previous strategy Also as '
 'the number of iterations increases the size of the step we take towards the '
 'ME play in each iteration gets smaller and smaller In this way the sequences '
 'of strategies are forced to settle down over time to the happy medium GTO '
 'set where both players maximally exploit each other This algorithm is known '
 'as Fictitious Play I find this a very intuitive way to think about GTO play '
 'because it mirrors what I imagine happening if two sufficiently smart '
 'players faced each other for long enough They would each adjust a little bit '
 'back and forth to take advantage of each others tendencies until at some '
 'point no more adjustments were possible because both were already playing as '
 'profitably as possible simultaneously This is GTO play Computationally '
 'Fictitious Play isnt necessarily the fastest algorithm but its dead easy to '
 'implement once youve worked out how to find ME strategies something thats '
 'very useful in its own right With that in mind a shameless plug this is not '
 'all just a thought experiment To see a walkthrough of how to find ME and GTO '
 'strategies for yourself with the easy to use iPython programming environment '
 'see my video series Solving Poker which is available at wwwdandbpokercom and '
 'wwwhusngcom PolarvBluffcatcher river game Theres a classic spot that serves '
 'well as a first game to solve because its simple enough to solve without a '
 'computer and yet its equilibria have a lot in common with those that arise '
 'in more complex games Suppose there are two players left on the river in a '
 'NLHE game Hero finds himself with a range that is completely polar That '
 'means that any particular hand in his range is either ahead of all of '
 'Villains hands or behind all of them Villains range is thus a bunch of '
 'mediocre holdings by comparison hands',
 'that beat all Heros weak holdings but lose to all the strong ones We say '
 'Villains range is made up of bluffcatchers here So effectively Hero knows '
 'where hes at with any particular holding He can look at his hand and tell '
 'whether he has a complete bluff or the effective nuts and he never has '
 'anything in between Villain however always has to guess at where he stands '
 'This bit about the players ranges is the crucial assumption here and its why '
 'we call this the Polar versusBluffcatchers PvBC game These sorts of ranges '
 'do come up fairly often in real play at least approximately If Hero bets '
 'aggressively over multiple streets it is likely that he has either a '
 'genuinely strong hand or a bluff It makes a lot less sense to play a '
 'mediocre hand strongly since itll often just end up putting money in the pot '
 'versus better hands and folding out worse On the other hand when Villain '
 'just calls down his range figures to be primarily composed of hands that '
 'just want to make it to showdown bluffcatchers Whats the decision tree here '
 'Youll notice I havent mentioned positions yet It turns out they dont matter '
 'since Villain will never bet If he did Hero could simply fold his air and '
 'call with his nuts or stacks permitting raise with an appropriate mix of '
 'nuts and air Since only Hero will do any betting we can always think of him '
 'as getting the chance to act first If hes actually in position Villain will '
 'always start the river by checking to him and if hes out of position and '
 'checks well effectively go straight to showdown With this in mind Ive drawn '
 'the simple decision tree for this spot in Figure  The particular pot and bet '
 'sizes here arent too important but for concreteness suppose there are  in '
 'the pot and  remaining in each players stack Also suppose  of Heros range is '
 'composed of the nuts while  is bluffs As for betsizing well just assume here '
 'that any bet is the pot sized allin For a fuller discussion of sizing issues '
 'see EHUNL Chapter  Before we look at the solution lets think about how this '
 'spot should be played There are three types of hands we need to consider '
 'nuts bluffcatchers and bluffs Clearly Hero should always bet his nuts since '
 'thats the only chance he has of getting Villain to put more money in the pot '
 'As for Heros bluffs his best line depends on Villains strategy If Villain '
 'always calls EVbluffing  and EVnot bluffing  so not bluffing is best But if '
 'Villain always folds bluffing is best since EVbluffing  while and EVnot '
 'bluffing  Figure  Decision tree for the PvBC river spot Verify that Villains '
 'best play with bluffcatchers depends on how frequently Hero bluffs What are '
 'his EVs of calling and folding at the decision point where he is facing the '
 'bet if Hero always bets his bluffs What if Hero never bets his bluffs  The '
 'solution to this PvBC spot is as follows Villain calls and folds  of the '
 'time each Hero constructs his betting range so that  of it is bluffs and  of '
 'it is the nuts This essentially means that of his original river range  is '
 'nuts that are going to bet  is bluffs that bet and the rest is bluffs that '
 'give up Lets verify that these are GTO strategies by checking that everyone '
 'is playing maximally',
 'exploitatively simultaneously with each of the three types of hands in this '
 'game With Heros nuts EVchecking  and EVbetting  x   x   so always betting is '
 'indeed best With Heros bluffs EVchecking  and EVbetting  x   x   Both '
 'actions here have the same EV Thus either choice is maximally exploitative '
 'This is good since weve claimed that Hero is playing maximally '
 'exploitatively while using both actions some of the time As for Villains '
 'bluffcatchers once they face a bet Their EVfolding is  and their EVcalling '
 'is  x   x   Again these are equal so Villain can make either choice and '
 'still be maximally exploiting Hero Notice by the way that Villains EV from '
 'the beginning of river play is somewhat higher than  since he doesnt always '
 'face a bet What is Villains EV at the beginning of river play when Hero '
 'plays his GTO strategy assuming Villain plans to call when he faces a bet '
 'What if Villain plans to fold to any bet  Now weve said that in a couple of '
 'spots the players can choose multiple actions and still be playing maximally '
 'exploitatively However that doesnt mean theyd still be at equilibrium if '
 'they chose different frequencies there In fact we saw in the EV calculations '
 'that the GTO frequencies for one player were responsible for perfectly '
 'balancing the other players EVs For example if Hero decided to bluff just '
 'slightly more often then all of a sudden Villain would strictly prefer to '
 'call rather than to fold with all of his bluff catchers This opportunity for '
 'Villain to improve his EV by changing his strategy means were no longer at '
 'equilibrium At equilibrium Heros bluffing frequency is chosen so that his '
 'betting range is perfectly balanced and makes Villain perfectly indifferent '
 'between calling and folding This sort of indifference between multiple '
 'options actually comes up often in GTO solutions of real poker games '
 'Whenever a mixed strategy is played at equilibrium it must be the case that '
 'the EVs of multiple options are equal Considering back and forth '
 'exploitation √† la Fictitious Play can sometimes make it easy to see when '
 'pure strategies just cant be GTO For example suppose we see a flop with a '
 'flush draw possible and were out of position facing a continuation bet '
 'Suppose we always checkraise with all of our flush draws and Villain knows '
 'it Then its reasonable to think that after we raise and the flush comes '
 'Villain wont put too much money in the pot whereas he will play much looser '
 'than he might otherwise when we flat call the flop and the flush comes since '
 'he knows we cant have it In that case it will actually become quite '
 'profitable for us to start checkcalling the flop with the draw in order to '
 'show up with a flush when it comes Similarly if we only checkcall with flush '
 'draws then Villains maximally exploitative response figures to motivate us '
 'to start checkraising Since neither always calling nor always raising can be '
 'GTO we must be doing both some of the time Furthermore for that to be the '
 'case Villain has to play in precisely the right way to make the EVs of the '
 'two options equal This is an interesting fact about Villains strategy that '
 'we can sometimes leverage For example in the PvBC river game above our '
 'preliminary thinking about how the spot should be played could likely have '
 'convinced us that neither always calling nor always folding bluff catchers '
 'could possibly be GTO for Villain So hed have to be doing both sometimes and '
 'thus Heros GTO strategy would have to make Villains EV of calling exactly '
 'equal to his EV of folding This equality is enough to solve for Heros '
 'bluffing frequency EVVillain folding EVVillain calling  chance Hero is '
 'bluffing x   chance Hero is bluffing x ',
 'Solving we find that chance Hero has a bluff  So a third of Heros betting '
 'range needs to be bluffs in order to enforce the indifference What Villain '
 'calling frequency makes Hero indifferent between betting and giving up with '
 'his bluffs  There are other spots where indifferences arise and these can be '
 'very useful in estimating GTO frequencies For example see EHUNL Chapter  '
 'However it is important not to take this too far For example suppose we had '
 'said that Hero started on the river with  nuts and  air Then theres no way '
 'Villain could be made indifferent to calling here since even if Hero bet all '
 'his weak hands Villain would still find it best to fold Thus the GTO play '
 'for Hero would be to always bet and for Villain to always fold Heros range '
 'is just too strong Additionally in real river spots there are more than '
 'three different types of hands and players ranges often overlap somewhat If '
 'Villain has a variety of medium strength hands when facing a bet some of '
 'them can be indifferent while others strictly prefer to call or fold If Hero '
 'has a variety of weak hands then its often the case that only one of them '
 'can be made indifferent to bluffing while some strictly prefer to bluff and '
 'others to fold Also the one that is indifferent is generally not the weakest '
 'bluff pure air as is sometimes assumed rather its some stronger hand that '
 'would actually capture a bit of value by checking as well So we cant go '
 'around assuming indifferences willynilly to try to estimate GTO strategies '
 'Sometimes indifferences dont arise at all and sometimes theyre not where we '
 'expect Spots where they do arise and how to use them to estimate GTO play '
 'both on the river and on earlier streets are major themes of EHUNL Summary '
 'We began by wanting to understand GTO play A set of GTO strategies contains '
 'one for each player such that all players are maximally exploiting each '
 'other simultaneously Thats what GTO means no more and no less To tease out '
 'the consequences of that definition we had to be precise about what we mean '
 'by game and strategy Then we saw the two amazing properties that make GTO '
 'strategies so valuable in HUNL play Firstly playing such a strategy '
 'guarantees that we at least break even in the long term on average over both '
 'positions and neglecting rake Secondly if Villain deviates from equilibrium '
 'he can only hurt himself and thus help us In  player cash games we '
 'unfortunately get no such guarantees Even if we play GTO we could end up '
 'losing because different sets of GTO strategies can have different values '
 'Additionally if one of our opponents plays badly he could end up hurting us '
 'along with himself However the equilibria of  subgames which are common are '
 'still very useful Finally we looked at the case in tournaments with ICM '
 'effects present In this third case blindly implementing GTO strategies is '
 'rarely a good idea since its easy for an opponents bad plays to hurt us and '
 'GTO play doesnt put any useful bounds on how much we can lose Next we looked '
 'at multidecision EV calculations Playing profitable poker means constantly '
 'asking the question which of my choices will gain me the most money on '
 'average and an EV calculation is simply the way to find an answer in general '
 'so some practice with them is indispensable A maximally exploitative '
 'strategy is simply one that makes a highestEV choice at every decision We '
 'saw an example of finding a maximally exploitative play in a cash game spot '
 'but the same approach works in tournaments',
 'as well Its just that at every leaf of the decision tree we have to use a '
 'model such as the ICM to convert from chip stacks to real money Once we '
 'could find ME strategies Fictitious Play gave us a way to find GTO '
 'strategies that is both intuitive and useful in practical terms It promotes '
 'a way of thinking about the game thats beneficial in seeing how to exploit '
 'opponents and shows that there is a deep relationship between GTO play and '
 'exploitative play Theres nothing magical about being unexploitable and like '
 'any reasonable approach to poker its fundamentally based on the goal of '
 'making as much money as possible Its simply a special case of exploitative '
 'play that arises when both players are playing maximally exploitatively at '
 'the same time Now the Fictitious Play algorithm would be tedious to use by '
 'hand for real problems but the Solving Poker video series shows how to do it '
 'computationally We wrapped up with the classic PvBC river game which can be '
 'solved by hand using the Indifference Principle We saw that at equilibrium '
 'the players chose bluffing and bluffcatching frequencies that made their '
 'opponents exactly indifferent to bluffcatching and bluffing respectively '
 'However the intuition we get from studying that model is more useful than '
 'the exact frequencies PvBC ranges are a special case even on the river and '
 'that assumption is almost never good on earlier streets Certainly players '
 'who rely too heavily on those unexploitable frequencies are often ironically '
 'very exploitable because the equilibria of these toy games are often far '
 'from the equilibria of real poker Bad theory can easily be worse than no '
 'theory at all if it gives false confidence For more on how to integrate '
 'these ideas into a complete gameplan see Expert Heads Up No Limit Holdem '
 'Volumes  and  Will may be hosting a LIVE webinar online class in either '
 'late  or during  to teach you more of his best poker strategies To learn how '
 'you can attend Wills webinar LIVE and get access to the webinar recordings '
 'please visit HoldemBookcom  For example if our strategy involves openfolding '
 'a particular hand in the SB  of the time and raising it  then after we raise '
 'and the BB calls we say we hold  of the hand Its necessary to keep track of '
 'this sort of thing so that we know how often we show up with particular '
 'hands in various spots  Expected value just means average value We still '
 'need to answer average value of what Here well be interested in the average '
 'size of our stack at the end of a hand We could also make strategic '
 'decisions by worrying about the average change in our stack size starting '
 'from the beginning of the hand or some other point The results would be the '
 'same but I think our way turns out to be much easier for nontrivial '
 'calculations  Its the maximum of  BB and  BB  BB  BB so  BB  Jonathan Little '
 'doesnt believe that you guys will bother to give this one a try Prove him '
 'wrong  The EVfolding here will be  in both cases If Hero always bluffs his '
 'range is  nuts and the rest bluffs so Villains EVcalling is     If Hero '
 'never bluffs EVcalling  So neither calling or folding is clearly best it '
 'depends on Heros bluffing frequency   x    x   in both cases  EVHero '
 'checking EVHero bluffing   x Villains calling frequency  x  Villains calling '

 ' MENTAL TOUGHNESS THE ULTIMATE PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE Introduction Doyle Brunson '
 'is credited with saying Poker is a hard way to make an easy living Truer '
 'words were never spoken The idea of playing a card game for a living is '
 'scintillating but the process of consistently making a living playing poker '
 'is quite difficult for most The average player is met with many ups and '
 'downs on the felt as well as off Sure its fairly easy to learn the mechanics '
 'of the game but I believe the mental side is where most players struggle '
 'Consider this for a second What percentage of the game would you say is '
 'mental Most players put this at a pretty high number and that number only '
 'increases as you move up in stakes Now make an honest assessment of how much '
 'time you spend on developing your mental game To figure out if you can '
 'benefit from enhancing your mental game consider your answers to the '
 'following questions Have you ever known what the right thing to do was in a '
 'situation but failed to do it Have you ever felt a sense of dread come over '
 'you while playing Do you consistently set and achieve goals both in poker '
 'and in life Are there certain players or situations that seem to get the '
 'best of you more often than not Do you ever lose focus at the table Does '
 'your confidence waver Do you spend time on tilt These are the sorts of '
 'challenges that most players encounter at any given time and experiencing '
 'any of them is a clue about the state of your mental toughness Failing to be '
 'on top of your mental game is costing you money theres no way around it If '
 'you arent working on your mental game on a regular basis you are likely '
 'falling behind The good news is that there are some simple things that you '
 'can do to improve your mental game I believe that developing mental '
 'toughness is the key to improving ones overall mental game Pick up any poker '
 'magazine or book and inevitably the term mental toughness is mentioned as an '
 'important factor for poker success Its simple really If you want to reach '
 'your maximum poker performance you must possess mental toughness On the face '
 'of it this sounds easy enough but there are several factors that make mental '
 'toughness difficult to attain The term is thrown around quite liberally but '
 'what is mental toughness Mental toughness is actually a constellation of '
 'several psychological traits and attributes Recent research indicates that '
 'mental toughness has a strong genetic component Horsburgh et al  and that',
 'mentally tough people are able to maintain their toughness across a range of '
 'situations personal and professional Even so research also suggests that '
 'mental skills training programs have a role to play in the development of '
 'mental toughness Unfortunately not much has been written about how to '
 'actually increase and enhance those traits within oneself This chapter is '
 'dedicated to giving you a succinct explanation of what mental toughness is '
 'and Im going to start off by explaining what we know about the psychology of '
 'resilience because resilience is a hallmark of mental toughness Then Ill '
 'prescribe a series of steps that you can take to increase your mental '
 'toughness The mental tools that I outline have been shown to help people '
 'perform more consistently in pressure filled situations Remember it is not '
 'enough to know what skills make us mentally tough you have to be willing to '
 'do the work to develop them Developing a daily routine that you practice '
 'without fail is the key to enhancing your mental toughness If you are '
 'willing to do the work you can increase your level of mental toughness '
 'Mental toughness deconstructed Because mental toughness is a '
 'multidimensional construct that has cognitive emotional and behavioral '
 'components it has been defined in a myriad of ways Before we consider what '
 'psychological research has to say on the topic lets consider how one of the '
 'greatest coaches of all time viewed mental toughness Mental toughness is '
 'many things and rather difficult to explain Its qualities are sacrifice and '
 'selfdenial Also most importantly it is combined with a perfectly disciplined '
 'will that refuses to give in Its a state of mind you could call it character '
 'in action Vince Lombardi For an alternative perspective consider the '
 'following Ive missed more than  shots in my career Ive lost almost  games '
 'Twentysix times Ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed I '
 'failed over and over and over again in my life And that is why I succeed '
 'Michael Jordan As you will see both Lombardi and Jordan know a thing or two '
 'about mental toughness Now lets look at what psychologists have discovered '
 'about mental toughness In general mental toughness is the ability to '
 'withstand adversity and the resilience to bounce back from failure time '
 'after time Its akin to a psychological muscle that is frequently undeveloped '
 'or under developed in most players Psychologists have long been interested '
 'in what mental toughness is and what makes someone mentally tough Lets take '
 'a look at some of the research There are certain traits and characteristics '
 'that mentally tough people possess The following key components have '
 'consistently been reported as describing the mentally tough competitor see '
 'Crust  and Gucciardi et al  Selfbelief Commitment Selfmotivation Thriving on '
 'competition and challenges Retaining psychological control under pressure '
 'Resilience Perseverance Focusconcentration',
 'Over the years several psychologists have attempted to consolidate those '
 'traits into a succinct and yet descriptive definition For instance Goldberg  '
 'stressed that a person high in mental toughness is one who has the ability '
 'to hang in there and persist over long periods of time copes well with '
 'pressure and adversity and has the ability to bounce back from failures '
 'Jones Hanton and Connaughton  went further and defined mental toughness as '
 'follows Mental toughness is having the natural or developed psychological '
 'edge that enables you to a generally cope better than your opponents with '
 'the many demands competition training lifestyle that sport places on the '
 'performer and b specifically be more consistent and better than your '
 'opponents in remaining determined focused confident and in control under '
 'pressure p  Clough Earle and Sewell  took a slightly different approach with '
 'their study and subsequent definition They drew from the psychological '
 'research on hardiness to develop their theory of mental toughness Hardiness '
 'is a personality trait that allows a person to remain healthy when faced '
 'with highly stressful situations After using qualitative research methods '
 'with coaches athletes and sports psychologists they declared that Mentally '
 'tough individuals tend to be sociable and outgoing as they are able to '
 'remain calm and relaxed they are competitive in many situations and have '
 'lower anxiety than others With a high sense of selfbelief and unshakeable '
 'faith that they can control their own destiny these individuals can remain '
 'relatively unaffected by competition or adversity p  Another more recent '
 'definition of mental toughness was put forth by Gucciardi Gordon and '
 'Dimmock  They determined that Mental toughness is a collection of '
 'experientially developed and inherent sportspecific and sportsgeneral values '
 'attitudes emotions and cognitions that influence the way in which an '
 'individual approaches responds to and appraises both negatively and '
 'positively construed pressures challenges and adversities to consistently '
 'achieve his or her goals p  Jim Loehr  one of the worlds foremost sport '
 'psychologists described mental toughness as The ability to consistently '
 'perform toward the upper range of your talent and skill regardless of '
 'competitive circumstances As you can see from the aforementioned definitions '
 'mental toughness has many components To become mentally tough you must set '
 'goals that will help you achieve success Mentally tough poker players do '
 'whatever it takes to reach their goals no matter the obstacles placed in '
 'their path Even if you have not been willing to do whatever it takes to '
 'reach your poker goals up until now you can change your attitude because '
 'mental toughness skills can be learned This is great news for poker players '
 'who are willing to put in the work While it is true that no one has '
 'extensively studied mental toughness amongst poker players it doesnt seem '
 'like much of a stretch to conclude that these attributes would be helpful to '
 'players Imagine how your game would change if you had increased levels of '
 'motivation and resilience the hallmarks of mental toughness Practically '
 'speaking a person who is high in mental toughness is able to regulate their '
 'emotions as well as manage their thoughts and behaviors especially when they '
 'find themselves in stressful circumstances Elite and superelite poker '
 'players seem to be particularly interested in these topics and it is not '
 'uncommon to hear them talk about such topics in interviews Specifically both '
 'Daniel Negreanu and Antonio Esfandiari have been vocal in their support of '
 'taking psychology classes and using mental game coaches I believe that '
 'players who show consistent results at high levels of competition are making '
 'use of mental toughness skills and training and you should too After '
 'reviewing the research on resilience',
 'of mental toughness skills and training and you should too After reviewing '
 'the research on resilience well get into how you can increase your overall '
 'mental toughness in just a few minutes per day',
 'Resilience Its hard to discuss mental toughness without talking about '
 'resilience Almost everyone experiences difficulties on the way to poker '
 'success In fact many well known players have gone broke multiple times If '
 'you are a tournament player it is possible to go for years without winning a '
 'tournament It would be easy to give up in light of such circumstances but '
 'the mentally tough poker player refuses to do that The word resilience comes '
 'from the Latin verb resilire which means to leap back or rebound Resilience '
 'is your ability to bounce back from adversity or failure Tugade and '
 'Fredrickson  define resilience as the capacity to move on in a positive way '
 'from negative traumatic or stressful experiences Resilient people dont dwell '
 'on their mistakes rather they look at mistakes and losses as learning '
 'opportunities While its true that no one likes to lose the way you choose to '
 'think about your losses dictates how much stress and tilt you will '
 'experience Also if you believe that you can ultimately be successful youll '
 'stay motivated to work on your game In general the resilient person exhibits '
 'the following Giordano  Selfdiscipline Perseverance Selfconfidence '
 'Flexibility Positivity Resourcefulness Level headedness Optimism According '
 'to Suzanne Kobasa one of the worlds leading resilience researchers there are '
 'three elements that are essential to resilience Challenge Resilient people '
 'see difficulties as challenges that can be learned from They dont see '
 'difficulties as a personal reflection of their abilities and are able to '
 'keep their selfworth intact Nonresilient people see problems as overwhelming '
 'and tend to give up easily Commitment Resilient people show high levels of '
 'commitment to their goals and they have goals in all areas of their lives '
 'Having goals for work play and family allows a sense of balance Being truly '
 'committed to your game makes it less likely that youll give up when the '
 'going gets tough Personal control Resilient people spend their time and '
 'energy focusing on those variables that they can control Focusing on '
 'controllable factors helps you to keep your confidence whereas focusing on '
 'uncontrollable things increases stress and anxiety Always remind yourself to '
 'focus on what you have control over Its important to note that resilience is '
 'not an innate capacity Rather it develops over time Every person has some '
 'level of resilience potential that can be developed Finding yourself in '
 'challenging situations is the precursor to the development of resilience '
 'Some people crumble in trying times while others flourish A key factor in '
 'whether or not youll develop resilience is your level of optimism Martin '
 'Seligman  has spent his career studying the impact on happiness of what he '
 'calls our explanatory style and has found that how we explain our setbacks '
 'to ourselves determines our feelings and our level of resilience Seligman '
 'began his career working on learned helplessness and he concluded that '
 'learned helplessness is a psychological condition where a person has learned '
 'to act or behave helplessly in a particular situation though they actually '
 'have the power to change the unpleasant',
 'circumstances This research later evolved into his work on optimism and '
 'pessimism which he calls ones attributional style Generally speaking your '
 'attributional style determines to what you attribute your circumstances '
 'Another way to think of it is how you explain to yourself why you experience '
 'a particular event Did you lose because you are a loser or because you got '
 'unlucky The way you answer this question tells a great deal about whether '
 'you are an optimist or a pessimist Do you generally expect good outcomes and '
 'believe things will go in your favor If so that makes you an optimist and '
 'this attributional style is associated with some very positive outcomes '
 'including resilience and mental toughness If you expect bad outcomes and '
 'feel as though things never work out for you then you are a pessimist It is '
 'hard to be mentally tough if you believe that things are never going to turn '
 'around for you According to Seligman  there are three Ps that determine '
 'whether or not you are an optimist and how resilient you are likely to be '
 'They are Permanence People who are optimistic tend to see the effects of bad '
 'events as temporary rather than permanent They realize that things are bound '
 'to change If you believe that you are going to run bad forever that probably '
 'wont engender positive feelings Thinking I always lose my flips is another '
 'example of this type of thinking Pervasiveness Resilient poker players dont '
 'let setbacks or bad events affect other unrelated areas of their lives They '
 'are clear that running poorly at poker does not have to sour other good '
 'aspects of their lives Personalization Players who have resilience dont '
 'blame themselves when bad things happen Instead they see the cause as '
 'something outside of themselves Instead of looking at themselves as a loser '
 'they analyze the situation to see what other factors are at play Perhaps a '
 'bad run of cards is to blame As you can see it is vitally important that you '
 'train yourself to look at situations in a way that will allow you to bounce '
 'back and recover You always want to look for the positive lessons in every '
 'unfortunate experience When things do not go your way at the table ask '
 'yourself How can I use this experience to learn about myself Does it tell me '
 'anything about my focus and attention Did I learn anything about the other '
 'players I can use in the future Did I learn anything that can help me in '
 'future events What parts of my game if any need my attention If you can come '
 'up with some good answers to those questions then losing was not for nothing '
 'You can use failures to tell you something about yourself and your game and '
 'thats valuable information if you choose to use it In addition to working on '
 'your attributional style there are several other methods of mental toughness '
 'training that you should include in your regime which we will turn our '
 'attention to next Your training program Its easy to be mentally tough when '
 'things are going well for you Where the rubber meets the road is when you '
 'find yourself on the wrong side of variance Long stretches of run bad can be '
 'particularly wearing on your psyche Perhaps youve been in a slump for quite '
 'a long time Or maybe you havent had',
 'the results you believe that you are capable of Whatever the case may be '
 'there are steps you can take to increase your mental toughness The real '
 'secret to mental toughness is to build it up before you need it Developing '
 'mental toughness is much like building your muscles It takes sustained '
 'effort over a period of time The trouble is that while most players want to '
 'improve their mental toughness they just dont know what to do The next '
 'several sections of this chapter are designed to teach you the actions that '
 'have been shown to be most effective in helping performers increase mental '
 'toughness Increasing selfawareness of emotional responses Poker by its very '
 'nature is a stressful proposition We all know that it is difficult to give a '
 'careerbest effort every single time we sit down to play Often times we make '
 'mistakes or simply run bad To add insult to injury poker is one of the few '
 'endeavors where you can do everything right and still lose The first step to '
 'controlling our emotions and building mental toughness is to increase our '
 'awareness of how our emotional state affects our performance You want to '
 'train yourself to be aware of your arousal level emotional state thought '
 'processes and focus Are they where they need to be If not you need to adjust '
 'them so that you have the best chance of success You should also know that '
 'being concerned with achieving an end result ie winning the tournament is '
 'associated with a lack of awareness and poor outcomes Lets delve a little '
 'deeper into how awareness works at the poker table Consider one of your best '
 'performances What were you thinking and feeling as you were playing '
 'extremely well Its likely that you were confident and focused You were '
 'probably able to anticipate your opponents actions before they happened and '
 'creative plays came easily to you You were in flow and could seize '
 'opportunities Your energy was likely high and yet you were able to remain '
 'relaxed Psychologists have found that there is an ideal bodymind state that '
 'is associated with peak performance Now think back to one of your worst '
 'performances Maybe you made poor decisions as a result of being on tilt Take '
 'the time to really relive your thoughts and emotions as you went through '
 'that experience It is likely that you felt anxious and unconfident Perhaps '
 'your selftalk was negative and it was hard to focus There is a physiological '
 'reason for such responses Two things happen when we face a tilting situation '
 'First the heart rate accelerates and then adrenaline begins to course '
 'through our veins Research shows that as the heart rate increases the mind '
 'becomes increasingly difficult to control In such a state the brains '
 'prefrontal cortex becomes depressed and its simply not possible to focus '
 'well Even the most talented and well trained poker player will find it '
 'difficult to think clearly and make correct decisions when the prefrontal '
 'cortex is not working at full capacity Luckily there is a simple process '
 'that you can use to quiet your mind in order to steady your emotions '
 'Controlling emotions with the  method A key component of any mental '
 'toughness training program is learning to control your emotions The most '
 'effective way to control an adrenaline rush is by using what are known as '
 'centering breaths A centering breath is different than simply taking a deep '
 'breath Its a specific way of breathing that slows the heart rate and allows '
 'for clearer thinking To use this technique you need to be willing to '
 'practice every day Your goal is to take breaths that last for at least  '
 'seconds and that force air into your diaphragm The easiest way to do this is '
 'to breathe in for a count of  hold it for  and then exhale for a count of  '
 'You want to count silently to yourself as you are breathing If you rush '
 'through this process it wont work Slow down and take the time to do at least '
 'two cycles of breathing Then assess your arousal state Is your',
 'Slow down and take the time to do at least two cycles of breathing Then '
 'assess your arousal state Is your heart racing Are your palms sweaty Are you '
 'feeling strong emotions If so take a couple more',
 'Research shows that as soon as the heart rate increases to  beats per minute '
 'cognition starts to decline By  beats per minute the brain shuts down all '
 'noncritical functions In such a state the prefrontal cortex becomes '
 'depressed and its simply not possible to concentrate Its not how much '
 'adversity you experience Rather its how you deal with adversity If you want '
 'to increase your emotional control you need to practice centering breaths '
 'every single day Spending a couple of minutes each day on this task will pay '
 'dividends many times over I recommend you start and end each day by taking a '
 'few centering breaths You should also use them whenever you find yourself in '
 'a stressful situation whether you are at the poker table or in an argument '
 'with your significant other Reign in your selftalk From a peak performance '
 'psychology perspective the most efficient way to improve performance is by '
 'increasing selfconfidence as well as your selfimage Once we have our '
 'emotions under control we need to find ways to increase confidence One '
 'effective way to do this is to create a positive performance statement that '
 'we say to ourselves regularly Years of sport psychology research has '
 'determined that what we say to ourselves determines in large part the '
 'outcomes we achieve Selftalk is simply the inner dialogue that we all have '
 'with ourselves You can use your selftalk in a way that enhances or detracts '
 'from your selfimage and ultimately your performance I want to take a minute '
 'to discuss selfimage before I get into selftalk Your selfimage is simply the '
 'way you see yourself Is your selfimage one of a good poker player or one of '
 'a poor player What you believe about what you are capable of achieving '
 'largely determines how successful you will be Many poker players boast about '
 'how great they are and maybe youve done that too But what do you really '
 'believe about your poker skills Do you really believe that you are on a par '
 'with the best players in the world I dont want you to get the idea that you '
 'should believe yourself to be a great player if you are not It is true that '
 'a positive selfimage is very important to mental toughness but it has to be '
 'based in reality Even if you are not a great player yet you can have the '
 'selfimage of someone who works hard on their game In fact what you tell '
 'yourself about your abilities greatly influences how hard you will work on '
 'your game The key is to tell yourself what outcomes you want to accomplish '
 'Now lets turn our attention to selftalk If you engage in negative selftalk '
 'it is likely that you will experience stress anxiety a lack of focus and '
 'ultimately a poor performance Evaluating your play in a way that leads to '
 'derogatory selflabeling or rating is especially dangerous Pay close '
 'attention to what you are saying to yourself especially when you are running '
 'bad or playing poorly If it is overly negative change it immediately Just '
 'remember that it is not uncommon for unhelpful thoughts to flow through the '
 'mind As I outlined in Positive Poker the brain has a built in negativity '
 'bias so thinking negatively and expecting poor outcomes is our brains '
 'natural default When negativity happens you must take steps to refocus on '
 'your performance statement Training yourself to maintain focus under '
 'pressure is a key factor of mental toughness and consistent highlevel '
 'performance is predicated on consistent highlevel focus Your goal should be '
 'to train yourself to use positive selftalk as much as possible You should '
 'use your inner dialogue to remind yourself to keep focused on the task at '
 'hand with an eye toward developing and maintaining a positive selfimage as a '
 'poker player People who maintain a consistent positive focus tend to have '
 'more confidence which typically yields better results The good news is that '
 'you can train yourself to keep your mind focused on positive performance '
 'cues which will in turn improve performance',
 'yourself to keep your mind focused on positive performance cues which will '
 'in turn improve performance The first step in this process is to become '
 'aware of what you say to yourself I recommend that you make notes about your '
 'thoughts especially when you are running bad and not playing up to your',
 'potential Review your notes carefully so you can figure out which of your '
 'thoughts are helpful and which are not Most players find that they think '
 'vastly different thoughts when they are playing well versus when they are '
 'not Selfdoubt often becomes rampant when we are playing poorly If you are '
 'able to eliminate dysfunctional and selfdefeating thoughts you will find '
 'that you tilt less and become more confident One way to crowd out '
 'dysfunctional thoughts is by coming up with selfpromoting thoughts that you '
 'call up when needed The most efficient way to stop negative thoughts in '
 'their tracks is a twoprong technique which includes thought stopping and '
 'thought replacement Thought stopping is a process whereby you use a mental '
 'cue to block out unwanted negative thoughts When you become aware of a '
 'negative thought regarding your performance you consciously issue the '
 'command stop to yourself Some people are more visual and like to imagine a '
 'giant stop light whenever negative thoughts creep into their awareness If '
 'that doesnt work for you you can wear a rubber band on wrist that you snap '
 'every time an unwanted thoughts pops up Whatever method you choose its '
 'critical that you notice when negative unproductive thoughts pop into your '
 'mind and take action immediately Next you consciously replace negative '
 'thoughts with a positive thought that is centered on what it is you want to '
 'achieve Its a good idea to have a series of positive statements prepared in '
 'advance of any adversity that might present itself The statements you come '
 'up with should be the ones that are the most helpful for your performance '
 'Try thinking about the outcomes you want instead of potential obstacles '
 'Train your mind to focus on your strengths and youll find your confidence '
 'increasing In order to train your mind in this manner you must create a '
 'performance statement that you repeat to yourself on a regular basis Your '
 'performance statement should be something concrete that focuses you on the '
 'process of poker success Here are some sample performance statements that '
 'you can silently repeat to yourself Stay focused on the current hand Prepare '
 'for the next street I look forward to playing against name your adversary '
 'Each hand is a new opportunity to make good decisions Make good decisions '
 'Actively put people on hand ranges Concentrate on hand reading Practice '
 'remaining calm and focused Be in the zone The most important facet of a good '
 'performance statement is that it is stated in the affirmative You dont want '
 'to remind yourself of what not to do Rather you want to tell yourself what '
 'to do in order to get the outcomes you desire There are several techniques '
 'you can use to come up with your personal performance statements First you '
 'can imagine that you are about to compete in a major poker event The best '
 'poker coach you know is there with you This coach tells you that if you '
 'focus on just one or two things you will be successful What are the one or '
 'two things he or she would tell you to focus upon This should become the '
 'basis of your performance statement In another scenario you are both poker '
 'player and poker coach As the coach look at your poker self and tell '
 'yourself one or two things that you should focus on in order to be '
 'successful What are those items The bottom line is that if you dont train '
 'your mind how to think it will often run wild and you may find yourself '
 'crippled by negative thoughts When playing poker your goal should be to '
 'focus your thoughts on',
 'the most important components of your performance If you keep practicing the '
 'thought stopping and thought replacement strategies youll soon find yourself '
 'more confident Id be remiss if I didnt address the following So often you '
 'hear good players say that they focus on one hand at a time I want you to go '
 'further by training yourself to focus on the most important components of '
 'your poker performance Pick out those few things that are absolutely crucial '
 'for your success and train yourself to hyperfocus on them Have you heard of '
 'the  rule also known as the Pareto Principle This principle says that  of '
 'your results come from  of your efforts By making the right  a priority you '
 'can stack the odds in your favor Paying attention to the most critical '
 'aspects of poker performance is the Pareto Principle in action Imagine poker '
 'success visualization Who hasnt been kept up at night replaying a poor poker '
 'session over and over again in their mind This is a form of mental imagery '
 'and in this form it is not very helpful Imagery is simply practicing a skill '
 'by using your imagination The process of doing so is known by various names '
 'including visualization imagery and mental rehearsal No matter what you call '
 'it research indicates that elite performers make extensive use of '
 'visualization Consider this assertion by one of the greatest golfers of all '
 'time Jack Nicklaus He stated that hitting a good golf swing is  swing  '
 'stance and setup and  the mental picture of how the swing should happen '
 'Nicklaus  Of course poker only has a few things in common with golf but it '
 'is likely that mastering the process of mental imagery could offer benefits '
 'Most poker players dont utilize imagery to its fullest potential The truth '
 'is that you can harness your minds ability to run through various scenarios '
 'through a systematic process of mental rehearsal Mental imagery is handy '
 'because it allows you to deal with problems setbacks and challenges in your '
 'mind before you are faced with them on the felt Think about this Imagine how '
 'much better you would be able to deal with a tilting situation that you have '
 'already planned for By guiding your mental images in a positive way you can '
 'feel more confident in your ability to handle challenging situations Heres '
 'something interesting about the human brain that explains at least in part '
 'why mental imagery works so well Your brain cannot distinguish between an '
 'imagined experience and a real experience The same areas of the brain light '
 'up during an fMRI in an imagined performance as they do in a real '
 'performance Therefore visualization is a skill that can help your game in '
 'several ways The key is to learn how to use the skill to get the best out of '
 'yourself There are several methods you can use to perfect your visualizing '
 'skills Before you sit down to play take a minute or two to visualize how you '
 'want the session to go See yourself playing well and winning Make sure that '
 'your visualization is very detailed How do you feel What do you see yourself '
 'doing What do you hear What are you thinking What did it feel like to see '
 'yourself winning Another way to use mental imagery to your benefit is '
 'through something called modeling Modeling or social learning is a process '
 'where we learn from watching someone else and its a form of learning that we '
 'use extensively in everyday life You can use this process to perfect your '
 'poker game by using a technique called video imagery Video imagery combines '
 'social learning with imagery and is a process where you find and watch video '
 'clips of an exceptional player to enhance your own game Here are the steps '
 'Decide on whose game youd like to emulate Find video clips of them '
 'performing a specific skill eg  playing from the small blind playing from '
 'UTG that you would like to perfect Watch each clip from  to  times paying '
 'close attention to how they execute the play that you want',
 'to perfect Now its time to visualize Sit down in a comfortable position and '
 'close your eyes Imagine the player executing the plays you have just seen '
 'several times Now imagine yourself taking his or her spot at the table See '
 'yourself executing the play in exactly the same way Doing this over and over '
 'again is a process of training and literally changes your brain Remember '
 'neurons that fire together wire together If you want to build up your '
 'neuronal network for  for example youd need to play a ton of  pots or you '
 'could achieve the same results by imagining the play of many  pots Just make '
 'certain that the player you are choosing to watch is making technically '
 'great plays You dont want to do mental rehearsals of bad plays Another way '
 'to use mental imagery is to imagine the type of session you are going to '
 'play before you play it Do an indepth visualization of what you need to do '
 'in order to be successful in this particular contest Make sure that you '
 'mentally review your best sessions before you sit down to play In this way '
 'you can get yourself centered and focused on your best performances There '
 'are several benefits to doing preperformance imagery such as this First '
 'positive images have been shown to increase confidence and focus Second '
 'being properly focused allows you to keep your mind on the task at hand '
 'Finally they provide a reminder of what you intend to do in each session You '
 'should also strongly consider adding a mental review after each session '
 'Mentally review what went well then target areas for improvement with an eye '
 'toward drawing out the lesson to be noted If you do this after every session '
 'you will likely improve your overall game If you are new to systematic '
 'imagery start with brief sessions of about five minutes at a time Research '
 'indicates that frequent but brief bursts of visualization are most effective '
 'Before you sit down to play do a five minute imagery session and do it again '
 'before you go to sleep Make your imagery very detailed Try to reimagine '
 'everything that was going on at the table What did you hear What did you see '
 'How did you feel How did your opponent look Perhaps by doing a mental review '
 'you might pick up a tell on your opponent or yourself As you get better at '
 'visualizing you can do more elaborate imagery For example you can identify '
 'the best session or tournament you ever played Imagine that the entire '
 'session was videotaped and that you get to select several highlights to '
 'review Write down the five or six best plays of the session The result will '
 'be your own personal highlight reel which you can play back anytime you need '
 'a boost of confidence Imagery is an important skill that every poker player '
 'should master Being able to perfect your game and master your emotions away '
 'from the table is a valuable use of your time that will enhance your mental '
 'toughness When you repeatedly imagine yourself playing the way you want to '
 'play and being the kind of poker player you want to become you are putting '
 'yourself on the road to creating a positive poker career Set goals to '
 'increase mental toughness Setting and achieving important goals is a key '
 'component of mental toughness People who are high in mental toughness set '
 'challenging goals and they are motivated to work towards them The good news '
 'is that you can use material youve already learned in this chapter to help '
 'you with your goal setting For example you can use what youve learned about '
 'mental imagery to visualize what youd like to achieve in your poker career '
 'Think about this for a minute What specific outcome would you like to '
 'achieve Perhaps its a set amount of money or maybe you would like to win a '
 'certain event The real question is how will you achieve your main goal In '
 'order to answer this youll need some more information about the goal setting '
 'process',
 'There are several types of goals that you can set What you would like to '
 'achieve is known as an outcome goal and ironically when we focus too much on '
 'the outcome wed like to achieve it can lead to stress anxiety and less '
 'success There is a time and a place to set and think about outcome goals but '
 'it is not while we are playing Set your outcome goals before you ever sit '
 'down to play Write them down and place them where you can see them and refer '
 'to them often On game day however you want to keep process goals in mind A '
 'process goal focuses us on the actions we will need to take in order to '
 'achieve our outcome goal and helps us to maintain confidence and motivation '
 'If you want to win a WSOP bracelet what steps do you need to take to '
 'increase your chances of doing just that You must have a list of daily '
 'shortterm goals that are directly under your control Your process goals must '
 'be measurable in order to be effective To get to where you want to go you '
 'need lots of modest daily goals These are the steps on your journey For a '
 'process goal to work you must know what you are supposed to be doing and '
 'then do it For example my goal might be to stay in control during a session '
 'Thats not easily measured but if I make my goal to take three centering '
 'breaths after each hand I lose then I know exactly if my goal is met Setting '
 'process goals provides us with a roadmap to success To stay on track each '
 'day ask yourself what am I going to focus on today that will get me one step '
 'closer to achieving my goal You should keep records of your process goals as '
 'well as any steps you take towards meeting them To further develop your game '
 'consider making a goal of keeping a success log for every single session you '
 'play You need to record three pieces of information for it First write down  '
 'things that you did really well in your session Second take the time to '
 'review the session and identify one or two things that you would like to '
 'improve Finally settle on one thing that will help you achieve the '
 'improvement you desire Review your success log before you sit down to play '
 'so youll be conscientious about what youd like to improve If you set a '
 'variety of outcome and process goals that are realistic measurable and time '
 'limited you will be well on your way to achieving poker success But every '
 'road to the top is littered with obstacles In the next section Ill discuss a '
 'new way of thinking that can help you stay on track to meeting your goals '
 'Reacting to obstacles When you run into obstacles on your path to winning '
 'what is your typical reaction If you are like most people youll try to '
 'figure out what went wrong and why Theres nothing wrong with this line of '
 'thought except that it is not the most efficient way to get where you want '
 'to go Consider the following quote Problem talk creates problems solution '
 'talk creates solutions Steve De Shazer What De Shazer is getting at is that '
 'whatever we focus on tends to grow If you focus on problems you may become '
 'overwhelmed De Shazer promoted a different way of thinking by popularizing a '
 'school of thought called solution focused psychotherapy He was driven to '
 'help clients create solutions to their problems quickly and efficiently He '
 'realized that focusing too much on our problems often makes us feel bad '
 'about ourselves and creates even more problems Even if we gain all the '
 'understanding in the world it wont necessarily take us where we want to go '
 'Unfortunately acquiring insight does not necessarily lead to the changes wed '
 'like to see When we focus on our problems too much we often keep ourselves '
 'from finding solutions that could help us improve our games So what is the '
 'proper focus for the poker player who wants to continuously improve their '
 'game and their mental toughness You need to train yourself to be solution '
 'focused When you think about solutions then your solutions',
 'player who wants to continuously improve their game and their mental '
 'toughness You need to train yourself to be solution focused When you think '
 'about solutions then your solutions grow A solution focused poker player '
 'keeps his or her thoughts centered on what he or she wants out of',
 'life and the game Allowing thoughts of selfdoubt to occupy your mind is '
 'counterproductive Anytime a negative thought comes into your mind you should '
 'immediately ask yourself the following question What is the one thing I '
 'could do now to make this situation better You can follow this up with Where '
 'do I want to go in life or with my game Then ask yourself Is what I am doing '
 'likely to take me towards my goals or away from them So often we make '
 'choices to do things think things or say things that are not helpful and may '
 'even be harmful Dont make this mistake Train yourself to always look for '
 'solutions No matter what is happening to you there is something you can do '
 'to improve the situation Your job is to figure out what that something is '
 'Dont get hung up on figuring out the perfect solution Your goal is to come '
 'up with something that will produce some improvement Gradual improvement '
 'over a period of time can add up to be pretty significant Small steps are '
 'all it takes to get the solution ball rolling Once a ball starts rolling '
 'downhill it quickly picks up momentum Remember that Dont be overwhelmed by '
 'thinking that you have to make huge changes all at once Instead focus on '
 'the  solution That is what is one thing you could do that would make your '
 'situation  better Figure that out and just do it Putting it all together '
 'Weve gone over many aspects of mental toughness in this chapter Becoming '
 'mentally tough is within your grasp if you choose to work at it I urge you '
 'to go through a process of mental toughness training each day and especially '
 'on days where you play Here is your playbook for game days Start your mental '
 'training by taking several centering breaths Make sure you quiet your mind '
 'and get focused Remind yourself of your  priority for todays session Repeat '
 'your personal performance statement to yourself a couple of times Spend a '
 'few minutes visualizing how you want your session to go Conduct a session '
 'review before and after each playing session For your session review answer '
 'the following questions thoroughly What did I do well in todays session What '
 'areas of my game need improvement What is my plan to make these improvements '
 'Before you sit down at the table decide that you are going to be solution '
 'focused You can help yourself become more solution focused by asking '
 'yourself What is the  most important thing for me to improve in my game What '
 'is the  thing I can do differently to make the needed improvement',
 'Remember mental toughness is a constellation of traits and it takes time to '
 'develop them If you spend some time each day working on your breathing '
 'writing performance statements reviewing your goal progress and visualizing '
 'success you will increase your mental toughness You will have an easier time '
 'if you accept that the road to poker success is always under construction '
 'Delays and detours are par for the course and should be expected You will '
 'make mistakes along the way everyone does Dont let a mistake or a series of '
 'mistakes define you Every failure is just information Learn from it and move '

 ' A PROVEN STRATEGY FOR ELIMINATING TILT Variance Variance is what makes '
 'poker profitable Without good luck and bad luck players would be immediately '
 'rewarded for playing a hand well or punished for playing it poorly Although '
 'you may hate taking a bad beat or having your opponents show up with a hand '
 'they had no business playing remember that without variance poker would be '
 'as profitable as chess There arent many chess players making a lot of money '
 'these days Variance may be what allows you to make money from poker but its '
 'also the toughest thing to deal with mentally Poker is a game where you can '
 'do everything right and consistently lose for long periods of time That is '
 'why even the best players can go on tilt In a game of small edges '
 'eliminating tilt is one of the best ways for your earn rate to take a big '
 'leap forward Imagine how valuable it would be to shake off a bad beat and '
 'continue to play as if nothing untoward had happened How much bigger would '
 'your bankroll be if you didnt spew off several buyins because of tilt How '
 'many more opportunities would you have to play higher stakes or go deeper in '
 'tournaments How much more confidence would you have in becoming a successful '
 'player Tilt is costly in many ways and some you wont even realize until '
 'after youve stopped tilting You may not even believe it is possible to stop '
 'tilting Many players assume that tilt is just part of the game as if there '
 'were a rule that taking sickening bad beats turns you into a raging tilt '
 'monkey If this were really true everyone would have the same reaction to bad '
 'beats and obviously thats not the case Tilt does not have to be part of your '
 'game Ive seen thousands of players improve how they handle the most tilting '
 'aspects of the game Whether theyve been my private clients or players who '
 'have read my book The Mental Game of Poker Ive seen players transform their '
 'game by eliminating tilt For the past seven years Ive been working with '
 'poker players as a mental game coach In that time Ive coached over  players '
 'from around the world including some of the best in the game My clients have '
 'won WSOP bracelets EPT titles and millions of dollars more as a result of '
 'their progress in their mental game I have a masters degree in counseling '
 'psychology and am a licensed therapist I originally worked as a mental game '
 'coach with golfers including players on the PGA and LPGA tour but in  I '
 'turned my attention to poker after meeting legendary grinder Dusty '
 'Leatherass Schmidt Since then Ive created a program for poker players that '
 'is proven to solve their tilt problem not just temporarily but permanently '
 'You may have previously received advice on how to deal with tilt and it may '
 'have worked for a short time The fundamental difference between the common '
 'approaches to tilt and my program comes down to how emotion is viewed '
 'Previous advice attempted to cure tilt by trying to block it out think '
 'positively or breathe deeply When emotion is viewed as the cause of problems '
 'at the poker table it makes perfect sense why conventional wisdom would urge '
 'you to become robotic trick your mind or become desensitized to emotion In '
 'essence traditional tactics suggest that emotion is inherently bad so you '
 'must',
 'get rid of it Of course your end goal is to get these emotions out of your '
 'game but they are a symptom not the real cause of why you play poorly The '
 'other big reason my program has been so successful is the level of detail '
 'given to all of the reasons that a player tilts and the unique ways in which '
 'they tilt Tilt is a complex problem and you need a program that accounts for '
 'that complexity Previous solutions to the problem of tilt have either been '
 'so simplistic or mysterious that it has felt completely unsolvable What I '
 'have brought to poker is a logical and systematic approach to dealing with '
 'tilt that is based on a foundation of over ten years of experience working '
 'with athletes and poker players One of the big reasons tilt had been such a '
 'hard problem to solve is that the definition is too broad Some players use '
 'it to refer to being angry and reckless Some players use tilt to describe '
 'when they start playing a more loose and passive game Others simply use tilt '
 'to describe any instance where they play badly When the definition is so '
 'broad that it refers to any instance of bad play regardless of the cause you '
 'cannot begin to understand why it happened Only when you know the cause of '
 'your bad play can you develop a strategy that can correct the problem In my '
 'work with poker players over the years I have found that most of the time '
 'players refer to being on tilt theyre describing being angry or frustrated '
 'For that reason I define tilt as an anger problem Putting every problem '
 'under the heading of tilt is a like a doctor saying youre sick when you have '
 'a high fever achy muscles and sore throat Very funny doc so are you really '
 'going to tell me whats wrong with me would be an appropriate response to '
 'such a terrible diagnosis Instead when your doctor says that you have the '
 'flu gives you antibiotics and tells you to rest youre a lot happier because '
 'you know why you feel that way and whats going to cure it In addition to '
 'anger there are other mental game issues that can cause you to play badly '
 'Many players struggle to deal with fear laziness overconfidence loss of '
 'confidence procrastination anxiety and a lack of focus The key is to '
 'determine whether your poor play is caused by anger or another mental game '
 'issue because each one requires a different strategy to solve it Once you '
 'know the cause of your poor play youre a step closer to getting the correct '
 'prescription This chapter focuses only on tilt After reading it you will '
 'have the most uptodate explanation of how to break tilt down and correct it '
 'Tilt myths For you to have a chance at solving your tilt problems you need '
 'good information about tilt Only when you understand tilt and the nature of '
 'anger can you begin to correct the underlying flaws that cause it Otherwise '
 'your efforts will only produce shortterm progress that will eventually have '
 'you tilting because youre still angry Lets dispel some popular myths about '
 'tilt and jumpstart your efforts to kill this problem for good Here are the '
 'ones that are most common and damaging Quitting is a cure Quitting is a way '
 'to protect yourself from the damage that tilt can inflict on your game and '
 'its a wise strategy to use until you learn to control it The problem is that '
 'some players get so good at quitting at the first sign of tilt that not '
 'surprisingly they stop tilting You cant tilt if you arent playing Over time '
 'however they forget they even have a tilt problem and guess what happens '
 'They develop a motivational',
 'problem Now they will only play if they feel perfect so they arent playing '
 'enough You may think this works as a way to cure tilt but in the long term '
 'there is a massive opportunity cost Rather than saving yourself money by not '
 'playing on tilt think of all the money you could be earning if you actually '
 'eliminate tilt for good Anger is inherently bad Have you ever been annoyed '
 'and then used this feeling as fuel to play better than youve ever played '
 'Very often players will make a few mistakes early in a session because their '
 'poker brain isnt in gear and getting annoyed at those mistakes is the kick '
 'in the butt they need to wake up and play great Michael Jordan was famous '
 'for using anger toward his opponents to get himself energized and focused '
 'and we know how that turned out Of course anger doesnt always create this '
 'kind of fuel to perform at a high level and I dont believe its an ideal '
 'source either However you cant say that feeling angry is a bad thing because '
 'thats simply not true The key is recognizing and understanding when anger '
 'has become a problem and consequently solving the root cause of it Absolute '
 'control of tilt Players often get annoyed that theyre tilting the tilt of '
 'tilt Theyre angry because they expect to always be able to be in control of '
 'tilt This especially happens to players after theyve made progress with '
 'their tilt As youll soon learn you need mental energy in order to control '
 'tilt If youre lacking mental energy because youre tired or worn down you '
 'cannot expect to be able to control tilt This reality cant be changed '
 'because its based on how the brain functions Keeping your expectations in '
 'line with reality will ensure that you can avoid putting yourself in a '
 'situation where tilt becomes likely In other words itll keep you from '
 'gambling with your mental game Everyone tilts Players who tilt often make '
 'the excuse that everyone does it as a way of making themselves feel less bad '
 'about tilting If everyone tilts then its really not that much of a problem '
 'and they dont need to worry about doing anything about it If you find '
 'yourself making that excuse or you hear someone that you want to help saying '
 'it call yourself or them on it One of my most successful clients told me '
 'that she had received advice from a wellknown coach who said not to worry '
 'about tilt because everyone did it That was until she started working with '
 'me Over the next several years she quietly became one of the most profitable '
 'headsup players in the world due in part to the fact that she no longer '
 'tilted The fresh start After a really bad day of tilting at the tables '
 'players will often start a new day thinking today is a new day They actually '
 'believe that because something miraculous occured while their eyes were shut '
 'overnight they dont have a tilt problem anymore If only it were that easy '
 'Believing this can happen is like believing you can wake up and play poker '
 'like Phil Ivey Or a casual golfer waking up and thinking they can play '
 'professionally No one really believes they could get that much better at '
 'poker or golf overnight and yet many players wake up thinking their mental '
 'game or tilt control has improved just because its a new day',
 'If you believe any of these myths are true expect to continue tilting Thats '
 'the only real result youll see The seven types of tilt People very often '
 'think that nobody understands their problems But in reality human beings are '
 'not that different from one another All poker players go on tilt for a '
 'similar set of reasons So similar in fact that Ive been able to take all of '
 'the hundreds of reasons players tilt and narrow them down to only seven main '
 'reasons That may sound a bit surprising but over the three years since The '
 'Mental Game of Poker was first published I have challenged players to '
 'identify an additional type of tilt that isnt explained by one of the '
 'following seven So far no one has succeeded To simplify tilt into seven '
 'types I looked at all the various ways and reasons players tilt and '
 'organized them by the root cause My goal was to make it a lot easier for you '
 'to both spot the type of tilt that you struggle with and solve your tilt '
 'problem altogether After listening to players talk about tilt for years '
 'these are the seven types of tilt I found Running bad tilt It doesnt take a '
 'genius to see what this type of tilt is all about This is the tilt that is '
 'caused by an extended bad run of cards whether it is for the session the '
 'week the month or even longer Of course its completely understandable why '
 'you would get angry while running bad but running bad is only a small part '
 'of this type of tilt The real cause of tilt during a bad run is that players '
 'experience so many tilt inducing occurrences in such a short amount of time '
 'that the mind cant process it all Normally a few bad things for example bad '
 'beats and mistakes happen each day so by the time you play again your mind '
 'has reset itself However during a bad run you lose with the best hand a lot '
 'more and make a lot more mistakes in such a short period of time that your '
 'mind cant reset itself So each day some tilt carries over to the next and '
 'that makes you more likely to go on tilt faster than the day before '
 'Eventually tilt can accumulate so much that youre practically on tilt before '
 'even playing a hand The key to understanding and solving this type of tilt '
 'is to prevent tilt from accumulating The only way to do that is to solve '
 'every type of tilt that accumulates during a bad run such as the two types '
 'of tilt used in the examples injustice tilt and mistake tilt Be sure to pay '
 'close attention to the other six types of tilt so you can spot the ones '
 'affecting your game Injustice tilt This type of tilt happens after youve '
 'been rivered coolered and badbeated for the umpteenth time and your head is '
 'about to explode You cant believe how unlucky you got Bad players suckout in '
 'the worst possible spot strong players run over you and you tilt thinking '
 'about how much should have won Ultimately youre annoyed because it doesnt '
 'feel like youre getting your fair share of good luck That feeling of '
 'unfairness or injustice is what best distinguishes this type of tilt While a '
 'thorough understanding of variance is a big part of what can cure this type '
 'of tilt many players deep down wish they could control variance so they '
 'wouldnt have to lose Or theyre just terrible at spotting good variance so it '
 'always seems like theyre getting bad luck and no good luck They also might '
 'be falsely assuming theyre running bad when in actuality theyre just making '
 'a lot of mistakes',
 'Hatelosing tilt While losing is a reality in any competitive environment it '
 'is especially true in poker What other game can you think of where you have '
 'to lose as often as you do in poker I cant think of one Despite that reality '
 'in poker many players get highly tilted from losing Those players are most '
 'often incredibly competitive and for that reason another term for this is '
 'competitive tilt Players with this type of tilt are so competitive that they '
 'cannot handle losing no matter how it happens Just the fact that they lost '
 'is enough to make them insanely angry Even if they have a good handle on how '
 'much variance impacts shortterm results in poker they still cant stand '
 'losing To be clear being competitive and wanting to win are not problems The '
 'problem is how you handle the inevitable losses often handling them so badly '
 'you end up losing more as a result Mistake tilt Poker is a game where every '
 'player even the best in the world will make mistakes The problem isnt that '
 'you make mistakes its that you beat yourself up for making one Maybe you '
 'felt like you knew what the correct play was and youre tilted because for '
 'some reason you didnt execute it You may even beat yourself up for a mistake '
 'that wasnt even a mistake like when you play a hand well and get unlucky '
 'Maybe youre tilted because you made such an obvious and terrible play one '
 'that could only happen from already being on tilt but you didnt realize that '
 'tilt could force such poor decisionmaking Or strangely quite a common type '
 'of mistake tilt you hate it when your opponents play poorly An example is '
 'when a mistake by a normally strong player ends up costing you money There '
 'are many reasons to be annoyed with mistakes and often players arent really '
 'aware of this type of tilt Anger at making mistakes whatever the reasons for '
 'the mistake is often a sign that you have a flawed understanding of the '
 'learning process Understanding the learning process isnt something that many '
 'people were taught Once you fix these flaws youre a lot closer to solving '
 'this type of tilt Entitlement tilt This type of tilt is caused by the belief '
 'that you deserve to win In essence you view winning as a possession that you '
 'believe is rightfully yours and you tilt when someone undeserving robs it '
 'from you Im supposed to win against fish you think to yourself after a '
 'session where you played great and lost How can you make such a terrible '
 'play You dont even belong at the same table as me you mutter to yourself as '
 'your chips get stacked by an inferior player The cards shouldnt matter I can '
 'outplay him you believe subconsciously but dont allow yourself to say The '
 'interesting thing about entitlement tilt is that it often makes people seem '
 'really arrogant when theyre not at all Theres just something about poker '
 'that brings that side out Believing that youre such a good player that you '
 'should win all the time doesnt just show your disregard for variance it is '
 'also a great example of what happens when you have too much confidence Thats '
 'right overconfidence is a problem that doesnt get a lot of attention but can '
 'be a big problem in poker Revenge tilt Revenge is common in everyday life so '
 'there should be no surprise that it should be common in poker as well There '
 'are many reasons to seek revenge in poker For example another player has '
 'been particularly aggressive against you and you feel youve been '
 'disrespected Or your opponent thinks theyre better than',
 'you or something about them just tilts the hell out of you As a result you '
 'feel the need to play back at them show them they cant push you around and '
 'you look for any opportunity to play a pot with them Maybe you even start to '
 'play terrible hands against them in the sheer hope that you can suck out on '
 'them and put them on tilt Revenge would be sweet if it worked However since '
 'you abandoned a winning strategy in an attempt to cause them pain or get '
 'your money back the joke is now on you your opponent has won Desperation '
 'tilt Desperation is a feeling that can be hard for players to spot In order '
 'to find it they have to look at the intent behind actions such as playing '
 'overly long sessions trying to get unstuck playing outside their bankroll to '
 'get back to even or forcing the action so they can win immediately The urge '
 'to win money is so strong you start to make huge mistakes become negative EV '
 'in the game and worse youre in a blind rage and dont care You just keep '
 'playing The more the losses mount the more youre willing to gamble to try to '
 'make back your money even by playing casino games or sports betting This is '
 'desperation tilt and its the worst kind of tilt Desperation tilt can get so '
 'bad that it makes profitable poker players look like they have a gambling '
 'problem There is a line for each player between whether this is a '
 'performance issue or if they actually have a gambling problem that requires '
 'professional help If you decide to tackle desperation tilt using the '
 'strategies in this chapter be sure to make quitting as soon as possible a '
 'top priority until you can prove that youre making progress Desperation tilt '
 'can become so intense that it carries the potential to destroy your poker '
 'career so take correcting it seriously Having read about the seven types of '
 'tilt you may have already begun to spot the types of tilt that you struggle '
 'with the most and youre ready to start solving them That section is coming '
 'soon but first its important to review some basic theory so you can learn '
 'how to best apply your strategy to correct tilt Tilt theory When learning to '
 'play better poker its important not just to learn how to play certain hands '
 'from certain positions You need to learn sound theories for the game so you '
 'can start to think like a poker player The same is true in the mental game '
 'The following is a theory that is critical for your understanding of what '
 'causes tilt and the steps youll need to take to solve it The YerkesDodson '
 'Law describes the relationship between all emotion including anger and a '
 'players performance Emotion is essential for performance its only when there '
 'is too much or too little emotion that there is a problem This is true of '
 'both positive emotions and negative emotions Having too much confidence is a '
 'problem because it shuts down your ability to think Being tired is a problem '
 'because you dont have enough energy to think Understanding the relationship '
 'between emotion and performance as shown by the following principle makes '
 'solving tilt easier This law states that your performance improves as your '
 'emotions rise but only to a certain point YerkesDodson Law',
 'If emotion continues to rise and crosses your threshold the top of the curve '
 'performance starts to decline because the emotional system shuts down your '
 'ability to think You cant perform as well because you cant think as well and '
 'if you cant think as well you cant access the skills youre currently '
 'learning This demonstrates what happens when you are on tilt The anger that '
 'is caused by getting outdrawn losing to a fish or making a mistake becomes '
 'intense and has the power to actually shut down your ability to think The '
 'more anger you have the less youll be able to think until you cant think at '
 'all and youre in a blind rage Excessive anger shuts down your ability to '
 'access higher level brain functions and youre left with the part of your '
 'poker game that comes easily and automatically also known as your Cgame This '
 'does not mean that youll automatically turn into a mindless zombie There are '
 'solid parts of your game that youve mastered and you actually know them so '
 'well you can even rely on them when youre tilt For example by folding '
 'marginal hands out of position when on insane monkey tilt youre '
 'demonstrating a deep understanding of the importance of hand selection and '
 'positional awareness Some players still have C games which can crush The '
 'YerkesDodson Law also helps to prove why anger can be a good thing If your '
 'emotions are too low getting angry is a way to get your brain into gear '
 'Seeking revenge or getting angry at a selfinflicted mistake can fire you up '
 'and give you the emotion you need to play your best That may not be the '
 'purest way to play your best but its also not the worst The power that your '
 'emotions have over your ability to think is something that no one has the '
 'ability to control its a pattern hardwired in the brain Many of you know it '
 'as the fight or flight response and your mind is essentially malfunctioning '
 'as if it were a computer shortcircuiting This is what causes you to play '
 'poorly when youre angry If the brain werent organized this way you would '
 'simply be angry and would still be able to play just as well as if you '
 'werent Very simply if your emotions are too high you make poor decisions '
 'because the brain prevents you being able to think straight The following '
 'also happens Your mind goes blank You miss key features of the hand You '
 'overweigh the importance of some information or fixate on irrelevant '
 'information You know the right answer but its as if your head is in a fog '
 'You fall back into bad habits While you cant control the fact that the '
 'emotional system shuts down your ability to think you can',
 'control whether your emotions reach that point In order to do that you must '
 'start trying to control your anger well before reaching your tilt threshold '
 'the point where anger starts shutting down higher brain functions otherwise '
 'you will be fighting a battle that too many players lose Part of the reason '
 'players lose this fight is that common approaches to poker psychology often '
 'suggest that its easy to control tilt The only time its easy to control tilt '
 'is when your anger is small and easy to manage But when it gets big and you '
 'lose the ability to think you also lose the ability to control tilt since '
 'thinking is what you use for emotional control Strategies to control tilt '
 'The reason you work on your game away from the table is to develop a '
 'strategy for playing poker that can be proven to be profitable You cant '
 'expect to make money long term from just randomly making decisions playing '
 'that way is what defines a fish The same is true in the mental game and '
 'specifically with tilt control In order to profit from your mental game you '
 'need a good strategy that incorporates tilt theory and counteracts tilt '
 'myths The three tools that are critical to this strategy are Tilt profile '
 'Injecting logic Strategic reminder Using these three tools often yields '
 'immediate improvement in reducing tilt However it is important to understand '
 'that for many players they are just shortterm solutions that help to contain '
 'the anger at the table In order to truly eliminate tilt you need the '
 'longterm strategy that Ill discuss later in the chapter Tilt profile The '
 'only way to have a chance of controlling tilt is by spotting the early '
 'warning signs of tilt If you dont recognize that youre tilting until your '
 'anger is already really high the emotional system will have already shut '
 'down your ability to think And thinking is your primary weapon against tilt '
 'To counteract this I have all my clients create a tilt profile which is a '
 'simple description of the unique way that they tilt Despite many '
 'commonalities every player tilts in slightly different ways and for '
 'different reasons One player might feel physically angry in the pit of their '
 'stomach and start playing passively another player might get hotheaded and '
 'begin to reraise every bet The purpose of the tilt profile is to define the '
 'unique ways that you tilt so you can clearly recognize the early warning '
 'signs and give yourself the best odds to control tilt Fortunately tilt '
 'happens in a predictable pattern and for predictable reasons Use the '
 'questions below as a guide to begin analyzing and identifying the details of '
 'your tilt If specifics are hard to find at first dont worry continue to '
 'think and study your pattern until youre able to identify what was '
 'previously unknown What causes you to tilt bad beats losing to fish running '
 'bad etc What do you say to yourself out loud or to other players when '
 'tilting How does your body react to tilt head becomes hot body is sweaty '
 'heart races fists are clenched etc What is the first sign of tilt that you '
 'notice',
 'What is the point when tilt starts shutting down your thinking What are the '
 'signs of tilt when tilt is at its worst point Here is a sample tilt profile '
 'I hate making mistakes and I hate when strong players make mistakes that '
 'cost me money When I make a mistake Ill say to myself How can you be so '
 'freaking dumb of course he has X in that spot When a strong player makes a '
 'mistake Ill say to myself Are you kidding me what a donkey Sometimes when Im '
 'really tilted Ill start talking back to him about why his play was so '
 'terrible Ill get pressure in my head and tightness in my chest The first '
 'sign is a slight pressure in my head and Ill replay the hand more times in '
 'my head Its also harder to move on to play the next hand The sign that tilt '
 'has started to shut down my thinking is that I make decisions quicker I feel '
 'pressure to make a decision quickly but theres really no reason for me to be '
 'rushed When tilt is at its worst Ill be swearing in my head or saying you '
 'idiot to a strong player when they make a mistake I just stop making good '
 'decisions and am only focused on getting it allin to make up for the mistake '
 'It is impossible to control something you cant see or understand The goal at '
 'this point is to build your tilt knowledge base so you have a chance at '
 'controlling your tilt While accuracy matters a lot in the long term simply '
 'beginning to pay more attention to tilt and increasing your knowledge often '
 'leads to improvement Creating a tilt profile is also important because it '
 'gives you a solid point of reference to evaluate your progress with tilt in '
 'the future Finally a tilt profile is something that youll ideally be '
 'updating regularly whenever you notice new tilt details The more you do this '
 'the more details you will notice and the better you will be at preventing '
 'tilt before it happens To help make it easier for you to create your tilt '
 'profile I created a template that you can download from my website '

 'we often spontaneously adopt a strategy of selftalk to try to get ourselves '
 'through it We may say to ourselves come on you can do this to push through a '
 'tough workout at the gym or it could have been a lot worse Im thankful that '
 'it wasnt after getting into a car accident where no one was hurt However '
 'what we say to ourselves can also be quite toxic and only makes the problem '
 'or our reaction to it a lot worse such as saying why am I such an idiot '
 'Injecting logic is a technique that gains control of your selftalk and which '
 'you can use to control your anger at the table Injecting logic is not a '
 'longterm cure for many players Unfortunately some players who read The '
 'Mental Game of Poker didnt heed this warning and they struggled to control '
 'tilt after making progress initially Learn from their mistake and be sure to '
 'think of injecting logic as a tool that can help you to play well for an '
 'extra  minutes  minutes or even hours depending on how good you become at '
 'using it Injecting logic essentially contains your anger and minimizes the '
 'effect that anger can have on your decisionmaking It has a similar level of '
 'effectiveness as deep breathing meditation neuro linguistic programming or '
 'other methods you may have tried before Injecting logic is superior to those '
 'methods in that it not only keeps anger at bay but also corrects the '
 'underlying flaw that caused your anger in the first place',
 'Injecting logic works best when tilt has just begun to build up because '
 'thats when your ability to think is still high If youre already on fullblown '
 'monkey tilt injecting logic wont work because you cant think straight This '
 'is why working on your tilt profile is so important It gives you the vision '
 'to see the early signs of tilt so injecting logic can do its job The core of '
 'injecting logic is creating a logic statement that tackles the underlying '
 'flaw behind your tilt so you can keep thinking clearly and logically and not '
 'lose your mind Heres an example of a logic statement I often suggest to '
 'clients who struggle when bad players outdraw them Weaker players have to '
 'get lucky for poker to be profitable When a weak player wins a hand like '
 'that it can be easy to forget in the moment that a bad player getting lucky '
 'on you is a good thing in the long run The variance in poker is precisely '
 'what keeps inferior players in the game and without them there wouldnt be '
 'any profitable games Keeping this in mind is what injecting logic is '
 'attempting to help you do especially after youre on the receiving end of '
 'your third cooler in short succession Look through your tilt profile and '
 'create a logic statement or statements Here are some suggestions based on '
 'the seven types of tilt Running bad tilt Without variance poker would not be '
 'profitable In the short term it is extremely likely I will lose hands this '
 'way Injustice tilt I have no control over shortterm results I only have '
 'control over the quality of my play Hatelosing tilt Dont let variance beat '
 'me by forcing me to play badly Mistake tilt Fixating on this mistake only '
 'makes another mistake more likely Take a note about the hand and work on it '
 'later Entitlement tilt Just because Im a better player doesnt mean I cant '
 'lose Work hard on playing well because thats all I control Revenge tilt If I '
 'abandon a winning strategy against him then he really will win Desperation '
 'tilt If I continue like this Im not playing poker Im gambling Win money '
 'steadily by playing great Forcing the action just makes it more likely that '
 'Ill lose Once you have prepared your injecting logic statement write it down '
 'on a piece of paper or your phone and keep it somewhere where you can easily '
 'read it when you need it Why When tilt arrives your mind isnt functioning '
 'perfectly any more so relying on your memory to recall your statement is '
 'like gambling with your mental game Strategic reminder While completing your '
 'tilt profile you may have also noticed the specific poker mistakes that you '
 'tend to make when on tilt Maybe you play too many hands preflop reraise too '
 'often or showdown too many hands Along with correcting the mental game flaws '
 'behind your tilt with the injecting logic statements you also need to ensure '
 'youre not making these poker mistakes That is why its important to create a '
 'strategic reminder Quite simply a strategic reminder is a tool that reminds '
 'you how to play the way you would if you were not on tilt and to nip those '
 'strategic errors in the bud before they happen When youre on tilt or near to '
 'it your mind is malfunctioning so you cant rely on your memory to be able to '
 'play as you would normally You need a strategic reminder To devise yours '
 'make a list of The factors or thoughts that go missing when you are on tilt '
 'The factors you consider when making a good poker decision',
 'The corrections to the common mistakes you make when on tilt So lets say at '
 'a basic level you think about the following when making a good poker '
 'decision What is my opponents range Will a better hand fold Will a worse '
 'hand call What does my range look like to them Then lets say when you are on '
 'tilt or near to it you forget to ask what your range looks like to them Your '
 'strategic reminder could be a reminder to just focus on that since its what '
 'goes missing You could also use this fourstep decisionmaking process or you '
 'could focus on correcting the mistakes that happen most often for example '
 'calling down too much Really try and make it specific to your game right now '
 'Once you have determined your strategic reminder put it on a piece of paper '
 'along with your injecting logic statement Now along with your tilt profile '
 'youre ready to put it all together to tackle tilt in real time Dealing with '
 'tilt in real time You have created your tilt profile and are able to spot '
 'the early signs of tilt You have created your injecting logic statement so '
 'youre armed with the correction to your type of tilt Lastly you have your '
 'strategic reminder in order to maintain high quality play when tilting Now '
 'lets put it all together in order to control tilt and ensure that you keep '
 'playing at a high level At this point youve done all the work necessary to '
 'implement the following sixstep process while playing At first youll likely '
 'make mistakes Thats expected anytime you learn something new But keep at it '
 'and eventually itll become easy So easy that youll be able to go through the '
 'first four steps in just a few seconds  Recognition  Deep breath  Injecting '
 'logic  Strategic reminder  Repeat as necessary  Quit Recognition When it '
 'comes to correcting tilt prevention is the easiest cure The better you study '
 'and learn your tilt profile and the patterns of your own tilt the easier it '
 'will be to recognize the early signs of tilt when youre playing When youre '
 'playing you must keep an eye out for these early signs of tilt so you can '
 'spring into action and follow the next three steps When you first begin put '
 'a lot of effort into recognizing when you are about to go on tilt and dont '
 'worry too much if you cant stop yourself from tilting The first step is the '
 'most important If you cant recognize the early signs of tilt you have little '
 'to no chance of stopping yourself Spending extra time to become skilled at '
 'recognizing these signs is critical and should not be taken for granted The '
 'more you work on this the sooner you can prevent tilt in the future which '
 'will save you so many more buyins in the long term',
 'Deep breath Once you have recognized the early signs of tilt take a couple '
 'deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth The purpose of '
 'this deep breath is simply to create some separation between tilt and '
 'injecting logic step  Plus when playing live it is discreet enough that you '
 'wont give away any information that you might be on tilt compared with often '
 'leaving the table to take a break Injecting logic Right after taking a few '
 'deep breaths read your injecting logic statement to yourself or out loud if '
 'youre alone with the intent of using it to control your anger Remember what '
 'you say in your attempts to control tilt matters a lot Say or think the '
 'wrong thing and tilt can increase rapidly Keep in mind that you many not '
 'find your statement that effective at first This is common until you gain '
 'more experience using it If after several attempts youre still seeing no '
 'improvement you may need to Revise your statement Study it more Study tilt '
 'more as you may have identified the wrong type of tilt Look deeper into your '
 'mental game because tilt may be caused by another problem such as loss of '
 'confidence or fear Find earlier signs of tilt you may be catching it too '
 'late Resolve accumulated emotion more in the next section Strategic reminder '
 'The first three steps are designed to get you into a better mental frame of '
 'mind Once that has happened there is no guarantee that youll also make '
 'better poker decisions Thats where your strategic reminder fits Read it and '
 'force yourself to play properly similar to the way you force yourself to '
 'finish a tough workout in the gym This step is essentially the same as '
 'injecting logic except it corrects the technical poker errors youre most '
 'likely to make Repeat as necessary Once youve had to control your anger '
 'during a session or tournament be prepared for it to keep coming back Too '
 'often players become complacent after having been successful using the first '
 'four steps Consequently theyre unprepared to keep fighting to control tilt '
 'and of course they tilt Once youve had to use the first four steps tilt is '
 'more likely to happen again not less likely By controlling tilt using the '
 'first four steps youre not getting rid of all the anger youre containing it '
 'so you can keep playing well The more tilt pops up the more anger will '
 'accumulate That makes tilt more likely to keep happening You need to stay '
 'vigilant and go through the first four steps as often as necessary for the '
 'remainder of the time youre playing poker that day Quit There is a strategy '
 'to knowing when to quit and when to keep pushing yourself Ultimately in '
 'order to eliminate tilt you must be able to control your anger at the table '
 'That means you will need to reach a',
 'point where youre not quitting at the first sign and where youre not playing '
 'so long that you keep failing to control tilt To guide the development of '
 'your quitting strategy think about quitting the same way you would think '
 'about how to rehabilitate a badly sprained ankle You dont want to push '
 'yourself too hard otherwise you risk reinjuring the ankle and you dont want '
 'to stay off it too long otherwise youll lose muscle strength Here are some '
 'suggestions to guide your quitting strategy When first starting out with '
 'your new tilt strategy you can decide how quickly you want to quit There are '
 'benefits and consequences of quitting early or pushing yourself to play '
 'longer Just be sure to make a clear decision before you start playing If '
 'your anger is so strong that you cant continue to play well or youve been '
 'worn down too much by using the first four steps you need to quit If you '
 'have a good tilt strategy once youve reached a point where you think its '
 'time to quit push yourself to play well for  more minutes and then quit This '
 'is important to building mental muscle much as you build actual muscle in '
 'the gym by pushing yourself Quit when youve reached the point where you cant '
 'recover a solid state of mind or ability to play profitably Taken together '
 'these six steps can help you make solid progress in your ability to control '
 'tilt unless youre struggling with accumulated tilt Accumulated tilt There is '
 'one thing that has the potential to make your attempts at controlling tilt '
 'especially difficult Accumulated tilt is the anger that builds up during a '
 'session over many days and even over the course of many months and years '
 'This accumulation adds an entirely new element to the battle against tilt '
 'because youre not just fighting against the anger created today youre '
 'fighting against an onslaught of anger that has built up over time The '
 'intensity of this accumulated anger is so great that it rapidly shuts down '
 'your ability to think and you have little or no ability to remain in control '
 'Injecting logic has no chance of working You can use injecting logic to '
 'fight against the anger created each day thats a fair fight The fight you '
 'cant win is when the anger of the past gathers together and gangs up on you '
 'No matter how mentally strong you are the emotional intensity is too '
 'overwhelming The only chance you have is to reduce your accumulated tilt '
 'away from the table by resolving the old anger and making it a fair fight '
 'Accumulated anger is what causes running bad tilt Sometimes players '
 'especially struggle when running bad because theyre still angry from '
 'previous bad runs The anger from past bad runs combines with the anger from '
 'the present bad run to shorten your tilt fuse so much that you can be on '
 'tilt the moment you sit down to play Making you aware of this accumulated '
 'anger is critical because too often players fail to control their anger and '
 'they lose confidence in the strategy Ive given them The strategy works as '
 'long as there is not a large amount of accumulated anger Then all bets are '
 'off until they can reduce the old anger Keep in mind that accumulated tilt '
 'is the toughest part of the mental game to improve so dont take it lightly '
 'Resolving tilt',
 'What you have learned in this chapter so far is the first line of defense '
 'against tilt This strategy is one of the most effective ways to prevent or '
 'control tilt and many players see immediate benefits As I mentioned these '
 'tactics are designed to contain tilt as it happens Ultimately you want to '
 'get to the point where you no longer have to contain your anger because your '
 'anger is gone Dealing with tilt takes up a lot of mental energy which '
 'ideally you should be using to help you play your absolute best You want to '
 'reach the point where your tilt is gone completely the triggers are still '
 'there but you dont react to them When youve reached that point you have '
 'resolved tilt Achieving resolution means that you have solved the underlying '
 'cause of your tilt When that happens you are automatically able to remain '
 'calm when confronted by things that used to be tilting At this point you no '
 'longer need to control or contain your anger because no anger is produced '
 'Resolution may seem strange but its something that you have experienced '
 'before perhaps without realizing it If youve ever gotten angry at a friend '
 'or family member the anger you feel can be pretty intense However once you '
 'come to an understanding or you accept their apology that anger disappears '
 'If it doesnt disappear then you havent resolved the problem Resolution is a '
 'longterm strategy and requires work off the table Very few players can '
 'improve their game tactically by only playing poker and not working on their '
 'game away from the table Similarly very few players resolve their tilt '
 'problem by only working on it at the table The additional work needed to '
 'resolve your tilt problem is beyond the scope of this chapter I suggest you '
 'pick up a copy of The Mental Game of Poker for detailed information on the '
 'work needed to resolve tilt Tilt can be a good thing You may find it hard to '
 'believe but there is actually a benefit to going on tilt I dont recommend '
 'that you purposefully go on tilt just to gain this benefit but since tilting '
 'is a current reality for you its better to make use of all that tilt offers '
 'rather than ignore something with the potential to make you a better player '
 'As already discussed when you go on tilt the thinking side of your brain '
 'shuts down and thats why you make incredibly bad decisions If you look '
 'closely however your decisions could actually be even worse You dont become '
 'a complete beginner when you go on tilt Instead you are left with the '
 'knowledge and skills that you can use without thinking These instincts are '
 'not just primitive responses theyve been trained through all of your '
 'experience and study Now no matter how tilted you become for example you '
 'still muck  when UTG at a  table An inexperienced player would not do this '
 'and that proves youve mastered some aspects of hand selection The benefit of '
 'tilt is that it provides an accurate snapshot of the aspects of your game '
 'that youve mastered and those you havent If for example you are working on '
 'thin value betting on the turn after you go on full blown tilt look over '
 'your hands to see how you played in spots where you could have made a thin '
 'value bet on the turn If you did poorly and missed a bunch of opportunities '
 'it is definitive proof that you still need to work on improving that skill '
 'On the other hand if you made some very welltimed value bets on the turn '
 'even though you were otherwise playing terribly you know that you have truly '
 'mastered this skill and can move on to working on something else One of the '
 'biggest mistakes players make is prematurely moving on to learn something '
 'new without maintaining focus on mastering more basic concepts Tilt makes it '
 'easy to know what needs more work and what doesnt So next time you tilt be '
 'sure to analyze your game afterwards This is a great way to get confirmation '
 'that what youre doing to improve is actually working Or if the opposite is '
 'true youll know',
 'confirmation that what youre doing to improve is actually working Or if the '
 'opposite is true youll know for sure that you need to work harder on '
 'improving tactically Its obvious that reviewing your game after a really bad '
 'tilt session may be the last thing you want to do but its one of the best '
 'things you can do to constantly improve',
 'Seeing improvement The road to tilt improvement can often be confusing and '
 'hard to measure The mental game is not like poker statistics that are easy '
 'to calculate and track Recognizing that youve made progress with tilt can '
 'sometimes be hard to recognize For example the next time you tilt your anger '
 'may feel just as intense and frustrating as always so it would make sense to '
 'think no progress was made However when you look closely at your tilt '
 'profile afterwards you see that you avoided your worst technical mistakes '
 'and didnt pound your fist on the table and swear Even though the anger felt '
 'just as intense it wasnt Recognizing these signs of progress is a massive '
 'step to maintaining your commitment to the strategy If a strategy isnt '
 'working abandoning or revising it is the smart thing to do Unfortunately too '
 'often players abandon a strategy to reduce tilt that is working because they '
 'dont see the progress Here is a list of signs that can give you confirmation '
 'that tilt is improving Increased recognition of tilt in real time This is '
 'always the first sign of improvement and is unfortunately the one that is '
 'generally least valued by players Increased recognition does not mean '
 'increased control At this point your tilt is just as severe and just as '
 'damaging But the fact that you can see whats happening is critical You were '
 'once blind and can now see the signs of tilt occurring in real time Having '
 'that vision means you have created the opportunity to control tilt but '
 'without it you have little or no chance This is why regularly updating and '
 'studying your tilt profile is key Recognition of the early signs of tilt '
 'Generally the second sign of progress is being able to recognize earlier '
 'signs of tilt than you could previously This is critical because the sooner '
 'you can recognize tilt the sooner you can act on it The sooner you act the '
 'greater chance you have of successfully controlling tilt Able to recover '
 'from tilt faster afterwards You tilted but compared with previous times you '
 'tilted this badly you were able to feel normal faster than before Able to '
 'prevent tilt With your increased recognition you now are able to preempt '
 'tilt and prevent it from happening using the injecting logic statement and '
 'strategic reminder Understand more about why you tilt Using the seven types '
 'of tilt and the tilt profile you have developed a deeper and more detailed '
 'understanding of what causes frustration Able to quit or able to keep '
 'playing You can make an objective decision when tilt is too severe to keep '
 'playing and when its still low enough to control Able to control tilt '
 'Increased recognition gave you the opportunity and your injecting logic '
 'statement works so well it gives',
 'you the strength to stop tilting Able to maintain control in hard situations '
 'Not all situations in poker are created equal and some naturally produce '
 'more anger Therefore youll know youre making significant progress with your '
 'tilt control when youre able to minimize the effects of it in the hardest '
 'situations for you Decreased intensity of the reaction Often the last sign '
 'of progress is a decrease in the initial anger that gets triggered As a '
 'result the anger is a lot easier to manage because there is less of it '
 'Common flaws when making progress Whenever you are trying to learn to change '
 'such a deeply rooted behavior as tilt you are inevitably going to run into '
 'resistance along the way Often this is directly related to your '
 'understanding of the learning process and how improvement happens If you '
 'find that you dont make much progress or you dont make any progress at all '
 'it could be caused by one of the following issues Assuming awareness is the '
 'cure Many people think once they understand why they tilt and can see it '
 'happening in real time they should have control of it This predictably leads '
 'to frustration when the truth proves otherwise Understanding the problem is '
 'just the first step Awareness makes things seem worse Doing this work will '
 'open your eyes to a new level of detail about your mental game This '
 'sometimes causes a situation where the more details you learn about tilt the '
 'worse it actually seems As a result it can often feel like youve taken a '
 'step backwards when in reality its a step forward Having a clearer picture '
 'of your tilt can be overwhelming at times but that changes as you make '
 'progress Nailed by variance early It is very hard to make progress when '
 'fixing a tilt problem if you immediately go on a downswing once you start '
 'working on it If this happens accept that fixing your tilt problem will take '
 'longer and will be a bumpy road for a while Fail to fix tilt in a tough '
 'situation You may have made some big progress but under a really tough '
 'situation tilt shows back up again That doesnt mean the progress youve made '
 'disappears This temporary setback simply proves that you havent solved your '
 'problem well enough yet This is high stakes mental game action and you need '
 'to gain more experience and do more work to meet that challenge Mistake tilt '
 'while correcting mistake tilt In your attempt to correct mistake tilt you '
 'are likely to make mistakes This can lead to a vicious cycle where youre '
 'angry because you failed to not get angry about a mistake Be sure to inject '
 'logic to correct your anger for still getting angry',
 'Stop working too soon Players often make some progress early on think they '
 'have cured tilt and predictably stop working on it Problems then arise when '
 'tilt shows up again often coming back worse than before Now not only are you '
 'tilted for the same reason as before youre also tilted because you were '
 'wrong about having solved your tilt problem Remember only when tilt doesnt '

 ' HYPNOTHERAPY FOR A SUCCESSFUL MINDSET Introduction Over the last few years '
 'you have likely heard a lot about the importance of mindset in poker What '
 'you might be less aware of is that hypnotherapy can be used as a tool for '
 'improving your mindset and overcoming issues you may have at the table I am '
 'a fully qualified hypnotherapist specializing in sports performance '
 'specifically for poker and mixed martial arts MMA Poker and MMA might sound '
 'like a strange combination but both undertakings are exceptionally good at '
 'creating strong emotional responses opening the competitor up to '
 'selfsabotage anxiety lack of motivation fear of failure and loss In both '
 'sports if you lose control of your emotions you are unlikely to succeed In '
 'poker I have used hypnotherapy to help clients deal with issues including '
 'the following Tilt Procrastination Selfsabotage Bankroll management Gambling '
 'issues In this chapter I will explain what hypnotherapy is and how you can '
 'use selfhypnosis to improve your pregame warmup and other aspects of your '
 'life I will also explain the deeprooted causes of some of the most common '
 'mindset issues that I see at the table and demonstrate how I use '
 'hypnotherapy to help clients overcome them The importance of mindset '
 'Emotional control at the table is one of the most important skills a poker '
 'professional needs for success Poker puts enormous psychological pressure on '
 'players it tests them emotionally with bad beats coolers bluffs and more '
 'What many people are now realizing is that the players who can be mentally '
 'toughest and tilt less often at the table gain an edge over their opponents '
 'My views and perspectives on tilt are quite different from some of the other '
 'mindset experts in the industry I believe everyone tilts for different '
 'reasons and that traumas and habits learned in the past cause many of the '
 'emotional issues that we see at the table An example would be a player '
 'feeling attacked when he is  frequently and who as a result responds '
 'irrationally or emotionally When I work with players on this issue usually '
 'the source of the problem tends to be found in deeprooted memories of being '
 'bullied as a child That is to say the pressure at the table brings back the '
 'same uncomfortable feelings the player used to deal with in school',
 'when being bullied In my sessions we look to work through and resolve those '
 'ingrained negative memories that are causing problems in the present day '
 'Once the player has dealt with the emotions around being bullied instead of '
 'feeling attacked at the table when  they start to see it just as another '
 'play to which they need to adjust Seriously hypnosis I know what you are '
 'thinking Are you actually telling me hypnosis can help at the poker table '
 'That is a pretty common initial reaction by anyone hearing about the use of '
 'hypnotherapy for poker All I would ask is that you read this chapter with an '
 'open mind and try some of the exercises when you are struggling with your '
 'emotions at the table Unfortunately most people have a misconception of '
 'hypnotists as allpowerful characters who manipulate and control the audience '
 'through the use of some kind of magical power or influence The truth is far '
 'less exciting Hypnosis myths  The hypnotist is all powerful When you hear '
 'the word hypnosis it probably conjures up images of a person on a stage '
 'dancing like a chicken This is far from an accurate depiction of the power '
 'that a hypnotist has over an individual I can assure you if you look at one '
 'of those performances and think he could never make me do that you are '
 'completely correct he couldnt In a hypnotherapy session there is no control '
 'over the client A hypnotherapist works with you to understand and then '
 'resolve the mindset issues that are plaguing you at the table It should be '
 'seen as a cooperation between two people and not as something one person '
 'does to another  Hypnosis is like sleep It may look from the outside as if a '
 'hypnotized client is sleeping during sessions but they are actually in a '
 'highly relaxed focused state They are aware of the environment and what is '
 'being said In fact they will likely remember everything that was covered in '
 'the session The hypnotic state achieved during a session is similar to that '
 'reached through practicing deep meditation you are in control but there has '
 'been a shift in how you view yourself your actions and the world around you  '
 'Hypnosis is conducted with a swinging watch Nearly all of my hypnotherapy '
 'sessions are conducted via Skype without video The hypnotic induction is a '
 'completely auditory experience so there is no need for visual cues Hypnosis '
 'should be considered a form of guided meditation as it is the same in all '
 'but name Any of the benefits of meditation you may have heard about '
 'reduction in stress improved control of negative emotions and improved focus '
 'are also seen with hypnosis A brief history of hypnotherapy Virtually all '
 'humans are capable of putting themselves into a hypnotized state and often '
 'do this on a daily',
 'basis without any realization that they have been in that state For example '
 'hypnosis is the state you find yourself in just before you wake or sleep It '
 'is also present at times of great relaxation or in times of great stress '
 'such as having the capacity to dull pain when injured as seen on the battle '
 'field In the ancient world nearly all nomadic tribes or cultures used '
 'chanting or drumming in order to create a hypnotic altered state We still '
 'see this in the lost tribes in our world today Interestingly it does not '
 'seem to matter where you are in the world you will find that all tribes have '
 'a form of dance or chant used to induce an abnormal state I would describe '
 'this state as a form of hypnosis The early religions and even the religions '
 'of today have used or continue to use chants in order to create an altered '
 'state The most obvious use of hypnotism in religion is with the Evangelical '
 'Christians who rally a crowd into a frenzy and tell a new disciple they are '
 'going to feel the power of God when they are touched by the preacher The '
 'expectation and hypnotic environment creates a situation where the '
 'participant may collapse or speak in tongues In the case of tribal cultures '
 'there is a practice of using hypnosis in medicine Many cultures including '
 'our own have either witch doctors or healers who use the power of hypnosis '
 'or in most cases belief in order to cure aliments Often the healer would '
 'have been held in high esteem by the community and it was their belief that '
 'he or she could heal them that made the remedy effective We still see this '
 'today in the use of placebo pills by modern doctors It is well documented in '
 'many cases that simply the belief that you will get better is enough to have '
 'a profound effect on the healing of the physical body In the tenth century a '
 'great physician Avicenna observed The imagination can fascinate and modify '
 'the mans body making him ill or restoring him to health Even in that period '
 'it was no secret that the mind held the key to the health and happiness of a '
 'person The first experiments that created an accepted form of hypnotism were '
 'on animals in the  At that time it was discovered that chickens could be '
 'hypnotized to be calmer through the use of various hypnotic techniques In '
 'France they used hypnosis to get hens to sit on eggs that werent their own '
 'This was a pivotal step for hypnosis because once it was accepted that '
 'animals could be hypnotized it opened the door for people to actively '
 'practice hypnosis on humans Dr Franz Anton Mesmer a French physician is '
 'regarded by many as the father of hypnotic therapy He created a concept that '
 'he described as animal magnetism and believed that magnetized water could be '
 'used to create a trance state for purposes of healing He was successful in '
 'many cases and used theatrics to enhance this belief in his subjects In '
 'reality the effect he was creating had nothing to do with the water it was '
 'accidental hypnosis However Mesmer was eventually considered to be a fraud '
 'by many of his peers due to his incorrect assumption it was the water that '
 'held power and much of what he discovered was lost in the fallout from this '
 'accusation Probably the most important character in the history of hypnosis '
 'is James Esdaile In  Esdaile opened a hospital in Calcutta and used hypnosis '
 'to perform operations on patients without the use of any pain killers '
 'Esdaile eventually performed over  operations using this technique Esdailes '
 'achievements provided the western medical world with evidence of the power '
 'and practical purpose of hypnosis as a medical tool from a practitioner who '
 'was not considered a charlatan Another important discovery was made by Dr '
 '√âtienne Azam in the  Azam is noted for his discovery of the splitting of the '
 'conscious This was an important step forward for the subject of hypnotism as '
 'the practitioner was now aware that he could talk directly to the '
 'subconscious and',
 'discovery of the splitting of the conscious This was an important step '
 'forward for the subject of hypnotism as the practitioner was now aware that '
 'he could talk directly to the subconscious and therefore delve more deeply '
 'and quickly into the problems that an individual may have In the  √âmil Cou√© '
 'a French psychologist helped make auto suggestion for selfbenefit popular in '
 'Europe He later used the concept of generalizations in order to allow the '
 'subconscious to find its own solutions to problems This is the idea that you '
 'do not have to tell the mind how to resolve an issue you only have to point '
 'it in the right direction It was in the  that hypnosis finally gained the '
 'approval of both the British and American medical',
 'associations This was a major milestone in the progress of hypnosis as a '
 'form of therapy At last the medical world had officially accepted that '
 'hypnosis was a useful tool and could help many conditions including pain '
 'control In the modern era hypnosis has become a fashionable therapy and is '
 'used to help with the symptoms of many ailments and addictions We also see '
 'hypnosis being used more frequently as a selfhelp tool In fact hypnosis has '
 'become so trusted and popular that some women now opt for hypnobirthing '
 'where they give birth free from pain killers in a hypnotized state What is '
 'hypnosis Hypnosis is just a natural state that most of us are in at some '
 'time or another every day The most noticeable example is the feeling that '
 'most of us have had while driving a car down a freeway and you suddenly '
 'realize you were on autopilot for the last thirty minutes It is that state '
 'of autopilot that we look to reach in a hypnotherapy session A '
 'hypnotherapist helps to guide you by using this natural state to create '
 'beneficial changes in your mindset During hypnotherapy we are guiding the '
 'imagination so that it becomes your reality This all may seem a little '
 'strange How can your imagination have any impact on the way you play or the '
 'way that your mind is processing emotion In order to answer that question it '
 'is important to understand that many forms of tilt at the poker table stem '
 'from emotional cues that are the product of what is essentially an '
 'overactive imagination This causes an adrenaline or stress response Through '
 'hypnotherapy we can change the way information from emotional cues is '
 'processed and change the way the body reacts in these stressinducing '
 'situations Read through the following and see if you notice any physical '
 'changes Imagine for a moment that there is a big bright yellow lemon sitting '
 'in a bowl in front of you right now Try to picture what that big juicy '
 'yellow lemon would look like Pick up that lemon and feel its dimpled waxy '
 'skin Imagine what it would feel like to give that lemon a squeeze and start '
 'to notice that familiar scent of lemon in the air Now see that lemon on a '
 'cutting board on your kitchen counter Very carefully imagine that you are '
 'cutting that lemon into small slices Notice how juicy it is Picture the '
 'spray as you make the first incision Once you have cut the slices choose the '
 'biggest piece and then when youre ready imagine and pretend that you are '
 'taking a big juicy bite out of that lemon Taste that familiar acidic '
 'sweetness as your mouth fills with the lemony flavor The vast majority of '
 'people as they read that section will notice some changes taking place in '
 'their mouth such as a bitterness running up their jaw extra saliva in their '
 'mouth or increased swallowing This is an example of a physical change '
 'created purely by the power of the imagination This is just one example of '
 'the power that your imagination can have on your body The simple truth is '
 'that once the imagination is fully activated the mind doesnt distinguish '
 'between it and reality so it indiscriminately prepares for the imagined task '
 'With hypnotic suggestion we use this to improve focus stress reduction and '
 'being in the zone in a particular poker session Suggestion hypnosis through '
 'visualization Suggestion hypnosis is probably what most people think of when '
 'they hear the word hypnotherapy The client listens to and follows the '
 'hypnotic induction and then follows the visualizations described by the '
 'hypnotherapist Professional athletes in virtually all sports utilize '
 'visualization and pregame routines as a tool to improve performance You may '
 'have noticed the way Tiger Woods always takes two practice shots before',
 'he swings at the ball Or possibly you have noticed Rafael Nadals very '
 'specific routine  Checks rackets  Adjust socks so they are the exact same '
 'length  Drinks from a bottle of water  Opens a second water bottle and takes '
 'a drink  Precisely sets the two water bottles next to each other  Walks onto '
 'court making sure to step over each line with his right foot He does this to '
 'ensure a level of control and focus prior to stepping back onto the court By '
 'rehearsing his performance in his mind prior to competing his nervous system '
 'and mind are already prepared for the task at hand You can use similar '
 'approaches prior to poker sessions to improve your chances of playing your '
 'best poker The use of pregame routines for improved mental performance is '
 'covered extensively in Josh Waitzkins excellent book The Art of Learning '
 'Waitzkin was an eighttime national chess champion as a child who used the '
 'same mindset techniques and mental preparation to also become a world '
 'champion in martial arts We have seen that visualization is used extensively '
 'to improve performance but what may be more surprising is the effect this '
 'mental rehearsal can actually have on the body Guang Yue an exercise '
 'psychologist from Cleveland Clinic Foundation conducted a study comparing '
 'people doing gym workouts with people carrying out virtual workouts in their '
 'heads As one would expect there was a  increase in muscle strength for those '
 'who went to the gym What was surprising however was that the group who did '
 'the virtual workouts increased their muscle strength by  without doing any '
 'of the exercises So here we see evidence of the mind creating change in the '
 'body through the power of visualization only In a metaanalysis on the '
 'importance of imagery for sports performance Felt and Landers  used  studies '
 'to judge its effect on performance They found that overall the studies '
 'demonstrated imagery and visualization in sports improved results for '
 'strength tests motor tasks cognitive performance and the learning of new '
 'skills Hypnosis utilizes visualization in a similar beneficial way When in a '
 'hypnotized state the visualizations the client can create are far more vivid '
 'than is usually possible In sessions when clients remember a scary event '
 'they often notice their heart rates increase Some even start to sweat if '
 'they picture themselves on a beach Others describe feeling as if they were '
 'actually in the place they were focusing on It could be said that hypnosis '
 'is like traditional visualization techniques on steroids In a  study on the '
 'effects of hypnosis on sports visualization Liggett athletes were instructed '
 'to use visualization both with and without being in a hypnotic trance The '
 'results demonstrated that the athletes had more success using visualization '
 'as a tool when they were in a hypnotized state and that they were able to '
 'create far more vivid scenes that enhanced the effect on their emotions This '
 'isnt the only area in which hypnosis has been shown to have a significant '
 'effect as an adjunctive treatment In their metaanalysis of hypnosis as an '
 'additional treatment to cognitive behavioral therapies Kirsch Montgomery and '
 'Saperstein  found that hypnosis substantially enhanced treatment outcomes '
 'showing a  improvement when compared with cognitive behavioral treatment '
 'alone So whether in sports visualization or a therapy setting hypnosis has '
 'been shown to maximize the impact on the client Visualization is the type of '
 'hypnotherapy I use in my pre and postpoker session  When used as a pregame '
 'preparation the player is put into a relaxed and suggestible state by the '
 'induction and then focuses on what is important to remember during the '
 'session These might be statements like bad beats in poker are evidence that '
 'you are playing well or accept the variance and be proud of getting your',
 'money in correctly or they might be visualizations around focus and '
 'confidence For those of you interested in adding hypnosis visualization to '
 'your pregame routine I offer a free pre game  on my website please use the '
 'link wwwpokermindcoachcomjonathanlittlebook I suggest you download the free  '
 'find a comfortable place where you can sit and listen to it for  minutes '
 'with your eyes closed As you follow the induction in the  allow yourself to '
 'relax as deeply as possible and listen to the suggestions When the  is '
 'finished you should feel refreshed and focused ready to start your session '
 'Visualizations applicable to poker In poker there is no need for '
 'visualization of body movements to prime the nervous system So how can it '
 'help Poker offers a different set of challenges compared to most sports when '
 'it comes to visualization This is because a poker players actions can never '
 'guarantee a win and players have no control of the cards they are dealt '
 'Visualizations in poker can be useful to help you focus on your goals to '
 'remove any negative thought processes and to prepare you for dealing '
 'effectively with downswings and bad beats There are a few areas where I have '
 'found hypnotic visualizations to be particularly effective I will describe '
 'three of these visualizations here The first is for the players to picture '
 'themselves at the table and then have them look at their play and their '
 'habits Many players have never really thought about what they are doing at '
 'the table and how professionally they are treating the game This is '
 'especially true for online players Here are the steps of this visualization '
 'process  I induce the player into a state of hypnosis  I ask the player to '
 'picture their last poker session as vividly as possible and describe the '
 'scene to me It is not rare for them to describe themselves multitabling '
 'while watching a ball game on their television and talking on Skype or a '
 'similarly distracted scene  I ask them to imagine how they would feel if '
 'their opponent was playing in the same way with the same level of '
 'distraction They typically say they would feel confident that their opponent '
 'is giving away some of his edge at the table and that they would be eager to '
 'play against that type of opponent  I then have them imagine how they would '
 'play differently if their opponents could see them They will usually '
 'describe focusing on the game having a clean and professional working space '
 'reducing distractions and being a more professional player  I bring the '
 'player out of hypnosis and discuss an action plan for improving their '
 'professionalism now that they have seen their weaknesses This is a very '
 'useful visualization as it forces players to take their actions into account '
 'and helps motivate them to make changes It is much easier to see flaws in '
 'others than it is to be aware of flaws in ourselves So by imagining someone '
 'else playing in that destructive manner it is easier for a player to '
 'criticize the negative behavior Once the player accepts that mistakes are '
 'being made and edge is being lost it is typically far easier for the player '
 'to adjust their behavior in a positive way For players struggling with '
 'variance I like to use this casino visualization',
 ' I induce the player into a state of hypnosis  I ask players to picture '
 'themselves as the casino manager running a game of roulette I have them '
 'visualize the gamblers getting lucky and hitting their numbers I then ask '
 'how a casino feels if a gambler gets lucky and wins in roulette In most '
 'cases the player explains that they are happy as it encourages other '
 'gamblers to continue playing the game However this does not have a negative '
 'impact on the casino because it is well bankrolled and has an edge  I ask '
 'the player to compare this situation to a professional poker player taking a '
 'bad beat at the table I have them make the connection between themselves '
 'with an edge at the table and the edge that the casino has Frequently the '
 'player believes they have a more significant edge than the casinos  American '
 'Roulette I explain that bad beats are just a way to encourage weak players '
 'to return and that they are actually investing in their business every time '
 'they are on the losing end of a bad beat at the table If they believe the '
 'casino does not need to be angry when losing to a gambler there is no reason '
 'for them to be angry at the poker table either Variance makes poker '
 'profitable for the professional in poker in the same way it makes roulette '
 'profitable for the casino The gambler is interested in the results of a '
 'session not an individual hand just as the casino is interested in quarterly '
 'income not an individual players results  I ask the player to see himself as '
 'the casino while he plays and focus on smiling when he sees bad beats '
 'accepting that it is evidence that he was playing correctly and that it is '
 'an investment in the future of the game  I bring the player out of hypnosis '
 'discuss the logic behind seeing professional poker as a similar role to the '
 'casino and create strategies to interject logic in the situations that were '
 'causing problems in the past Another visualization for players struggling '
 'with the concept of variance is the tide of chips  I induce the player into '
 'a state of hypnosis  I ask the player to picture the poker table and start '
 'to view variance like the tide of the sea it flows in and out each time it '
 'leaves you are just left with the chips your edge deserves There is no way '
 'to control the tide of the sea just as there is no way to control variance '
 'in poker You have to accept it and use it to your advantage  I have the '
 'player picture an opponent who does not understand this Every time the tide '
 'goes out they panic and adjust their game I ask how they feel about that '
 'opponent how profitable do they believe they will be  I help the player to '
 'accept that variance is natural and to understand the edge that this '
 'knowledge gives the player The tide goes in and out but all that matters is '
 'the players decisions in each and every spot in every hand  I bring the '
 'player out of hypnosis and discuss the realities of variance and poker '
 'profitability These are only a few of the many ways that visualization can '
 'be used to start training your mind to perform more profitably at the poker '
 'table Selfhypnosis and suggestion script It is not always convenient or '
 'possible to listen to a   before a session and sometimes there is an issue '
 'you would like to focus on other than those suggested in the audio file In '
 'this section I discuss how to utilize selfhypnosis how to use that state to '
 'improve your poker and how to make changes in other areas of your life '
 'Selfhypnosis is an excellent way to move your life and in this case your '
 'poker game in a more positive direction It is a tool you can use to work on '
 'any mindset leaks improve focus visualize your goals and visualize your path '
 'to reaching that future success Ideally prior to attempting selfhypnosis '
 'download the free  from my website and listen to it a couple of times so '
 'that you have an understanding of the state that you want to achieve '
 'Activating and',
 'couple of times so that you have an understanding of the state that you want '
 'to achieve Activating and utilizing selfhypnosis requires proceeding through '
 'a number of steps  Induction  Deepener  Affirmations  Visualization  Leaving '
 'the hypnotic state The first step is to enter the hypnotized state There are '
 'a number of ways of doing this but I have found progressive relaxation to be '
 'an excellent way to introduce hypnotherapy The aim is to progressively relax '
 'and release the tension from your body working from your head',
 'down to your toes Below is a script to follow to reach the required level of '
 'relaxation  Induction Find a comfortable place to sit and uncross your hands '
 'and feet Close your eyes and take a deep breath As you slowly exhale release '
 'any stress and tension from your body Take another deep breath and as you '
 'relax allow yourself to sink deeper and deeper into your chair With each '
 'breath you take allowing yourself to sink deeper and deeper relax further '
 'into tranquility and calm Any noises you hear inside the room or outside the '
 'room will help to relax you further relax you deeper into the chair Take '
 'another deep breath and as you exhale enjoy this time that is just for you '
 'this time to relax completely In this next section if you struggle to relax '
 'the body parts with your mind just tense and release each body part as you '
 'go When you release the muscles youll notice an instant reduction of tension '
 'Now focus your attention on the soles of your feet using the power of your '
 'mind to relax and release any tension stored there Picture this relaxation '
 'as a color or warmth and allow it to slowly spread through your feet and '
 'ankles up into your calves and knees relaxing and releasing as it goes Relax '
 'your thighs now up into your back and spine and with each breath you take '
 'sink deeper and deeper into the chair Relax your chest now and allow your '
 'breathing to slow Notice your heart rate starting to slow Relax your '
 'shoulders through your arms until you can feel that relaxation at the tips '
 'of your fingers and thumbs Relax your neck your mouth and jaw through your '
 'cheeks just smoothing the skin of your face as it goes Relax your eye lids '
 'through your forehead and into your scalp your whole body just so '
 'comfortable and just so calm  Deepener The next step is to focus on '
 'deepening the state of relaxation The following is a classic hypnotherapy '
 'staircase deepener Picture yourself at the top of a staircase of ten steps '
 'Make it as vivid as possible in your mind Now count yourself down that '
 'staircase and with each number you count take another step down the '
 'staircase and into deeper levels of relaxation and calm Ten First step down '
 'no need to hurry Nine So calm so comfortable Eight Seven Drifting further '
 'drifting deeper Six Five Half way down now twice as relaxed Four Three '
 'Enjoying this feeling just letting go Two One One more step to go Zero '
 'Totally relaxed and completely calm Now picture a door in your minds eye '
 'Behind that door is the most relaxing place you can imagine Step through '
 'that door and find yourself there just so comfortable so calm and relaxed '
 'Once you reach this point you should be in the hypnotized state This is the '
 'working state where affirmations and visualizations are utilized to prepare '
 'for the session  Affirmations Prior to the session write down some '
 'affirmations relating to issues that you would like to improve It is',
 'important that you focus on using positive rather than negative language in '
 'this state Stay away from words such as wont dont must try and cant Rather '
 'than using I wont tilt when I take bad beats a better affirmation would be I '
 'am focused and confident no matter the run of cards Some affirmations that '
 'you may find useful for poker are I am a professional player I accept and '
 'understand that variance makes the game profitable I focus on every decision '
 'in every hand enjoying playing to the best of my ability Poker is a longterm '
 'game individual hands and sessions have no impact on my emotions I love to '
 'play poker and enjoy every moment at the table Study improves me as a player '
 'and I enjoy increasing my edge Im the casino individual hands can win or '
 'lose but my edge provides me with longterm profit You will have some idea as '
 'to whether those statements resonate with you and your game It is important '
 'that you design affirmations appropriate for you taking into account your '
 'weaknesses and what you would like to improve Repeat the relevant '
 'affirmations for your issues at least three times focusing on accepting them '
 'and allowing change to happen These are obviously interchangeable with '
 'suggestions outside of poker so you can use this same technique with '
 'affirmations for weight loss confidence in social situations quitting '
 'smoking etc  Visualization After repeating and focusing on affirmations '
 'visualization is used to help create a feeling of flow and focus for the '
 'session One way of doing this it to remember a time when you were playing '
 'your best poker When you were absolutely immersed in the game and thinking '
 'through each decision in every hand Remember as vividly as you can exactly '
 'how that felt How were you feeling Where was your level of confidence How '
 'enjoyable was the session Picture these feelings as a color or a warmth and '
 'allow them to flow through every muscle every cell in your body Make sure '
 'you generate real and observable sensations The more real you manifest this '
 'feeling the more powerful the result will be The next step is to start to '
 'amplify those feelings If you used a color make it brighter and more vivid '
 'Use your imagination to increase the feelings in any way that is natural to '
 'you Start to visualize how being even more focused would feel Perhaps '
 'picturing yourself at the table and noticing that the outside world '
 'everything outside of the game is in black and white and the table the cards '
 'and your opponents are in vivid color Nothing else in the world needs to '
 'matter when you are at the table only making the correct decision on every '
 'street in every hand Start to really look forward to playing this way Feel '
 'that motivation build as you start your session Another visualization you '
 'could use is seeing yourself in the control room of your mind This is an '
 'effective technique to help visualize internal change Imagine yourself '
 'wandering down the corridors of your mind looking for that door marked '
 'Control Room This is the room in which your mind exercises control over your '
 'actions your words your emotions everything your mind is able to exert any '
 'control over Now just open the door to the control room and take a look '
 'inside You see the computer in the background A human greets you and tells '
 'you that everything is working fine with the computer its gremlin free and '
 'that the chimp is boxed well fed and content He points you to the monitor '
 'that allows you to update your attributes so you can be ready for todays '
 'session And now Id like you to go right up to the computer and see your '
 'current level of focus at the poker table There should be a number on the '
 'screen from  to  Take the controls of the computer that regulates your focus '

 'as I count myself back up For example One So ready so focused Two Feeling '
 'the confidence building inside me Three Halfway there Four True professional '
 'ready for success Five Opening my eyes ready for the day ready to play my '
 'best poker These numbers can be spoken out loud or just said in your mind '
 'Once you have exited the hypnotic state you should feel refreshed and ready '
 'to play Tilt and focus We have looked at the benefits of visualization and '
 'suggestion hypnotherapy at the poker table However hypnotherapy is far more '
 'interesting and effective when used to explore and resolve the root causes '
 'of emotional issues at the table Before we look at how we try and resolve '
 'tilt lets first get an idea of what tilt is During poker sessions many '
 'players start to notice their emotions getting in the way of rational play '
 'This can be seen in a number of different ways including anger anxiety '
 'quitting too early quitting too late gambling excessively and many more '
 'There have been attempts to categorize the different types of tilt and view '
 'them as individual issues Personally I view tilt as any emotional response '
 'that impacts your ability to play your best poker It does not need to be the '
 'stereotypical rage after a bad beat Tilt can just as easily be '
 'overconfidence when running well Where does tilt come from Tilt is a learned '
 'behavior At some point in your past a situation or series of events '
 'subconsciously taught you that your emotional response to tilt is '
 'appropriate',
 'We know that tilt is a personal response While there are common things that '
 'tilt players at the table there are no events that are guaranteed to put '
 'every player on tilt Some players can easily deal with their AA being '
 'cracked and others in the same situation will react terribly Everyone seems '
 'to have different triggers for tilt and when looking to resolve this tilt we '
 'must first understand where it comes from The chart above shows how '
 'anxieties phantom pain panic attacks and some stressrelated illnesses can be '
 'formed The tilt we see at the table is formed in the same way When your mind '
 'generates tilt at the table it is picking up that response from behavior '
 'learned by your subconscious As we discussed earlier the player '
 'uncomfortable with being  at a subconscious level is often connecting the '
 'situation to being bullied at school The player screaming and shouting at '
 'the dealer is often brought up in a household where issues are resolved with '
 'aggression I will describe an example of a phobia being created through this '
 'process We will work backwards from the fear as that is typically how a '
 'hypnotherapy session will work Fear of spiders A client has a fear of '
 'spiders and comes to a hypnotherapist to help with the issue The '
 'hypnotherapist does the initial consultation with the hypnotic induction and '
 'starts to work through the fear The hypnotherapist has the client imagine a '
 'recent time the client remembers being scared of spiders and how that felt '
 'Usually this will be something like There was a large spider in the sink I '
 'screamed and felt my chest contract my breathing quicken and pulse increase '
 'The client is directed to an earlier memory of feeling that way Usually with '
 'a statement like Ill now count you back from five to one and youll remember '
 'another connected memory another time you felt that same way The next memory '
 'is typically a secondary sensitizing event SSE This could be something like '
 'I was  A boy in school threw a spider at me and I was terrified These '
 'secondary events are the events that prove to the individual their fear is '
 'justified Each time there is evidence that a fear has value it increases the '
 'phobia think of the claustrophobic person stuck in an elevator or a bulimic '
 'person being called overweight The SSEs build and create cumulative trauma '
 'amplifying any emotional responses',
 'Again the hypnotherapist counts the client back to an earlier memory where '
 'the client experienced similar feelings Usually the next event is another '
 'SSE again earlier in age We keep repeating this process until we find the '
 'initial sensitizing event ISE Sometimes this process is achieved in one '
 'session and other times over multiple sessions For fear of spiders in every '
 'client with whom I have worked the ISE was a parent screaming and '
 'overreacting to a spider when the client was very young The toddler learned '
 'from the reaction of the parent that spiders are dangerous and the '
 'subconscious accepted this as fact creating the root ISE of the phobia So '
 'why would humans evolve this way A baby is born with only the fear of loud '
 'noises and falling We learn what to fear from our parents If a baby sees a '
 'lion it shows no fear However if the mother screams and panics the baby '
 'learns that lions are dangerous and responds accordingly For nearly all '
 'human existence this was a useful survival technique Unfortunately in the '
 'modern world where we rarely need to run from lions or tigers we still pick '
 'up fears in the same manner Once the ISE is determined the hypnotherapist '
 'works to remove the emotion from the situation Through adult eyes it is easy '
 'to accept that your mothers fear of spiders is no reason to fear them '
 'yourself There are a number of techniques that can be used to inject logic '
 'and remove the fear from the situation Typically once the emotion has been '
 'cleared the client no longer has the same phobia fight or flight response '
 'when they see a spider Now with a session regarding fear of spiders there '
 'may be some emotion shown but it is less common When the ISE turns out to be '
 'an issue with parents a traumatic event death in the family etc it is very '
 'common for the client to start to cry as they release the emotion This '
 'emotional release is an abreaction and typically the client will feel what '
 'they describe as a weight being lifted from them Hypnoanalysis in poker With '
 'poker clients I use the same process to discover root causes of emotional '
 'reactions and attempt to resolve them I start with identifying the mindset '
 'issue the client is dealing with at the table rage frustration gambling '
 'anxiety selfsabotage lack of motivation etc I start to connect those '
 'feelings to earlier events in order to get an understanding of what created '
 'the problem The following are some of the common issues at the poker table '
 'and underlying ISEs that have presented themselves with players with whom I '
 'have worked If you are struggling with any of these problems at the table '
 'take a moment to consider where your behavior might be coming from '
 'Procrastination and motivation Many players I work with come to me with '
 'issues of procrastination holding them back from success at the table The '
 'lack of motivation could be showing in their volume at the table or in '
 'difficulties in putting in the correct amount of study time When I work with '
 'players with procrastination issues one of the first questions I ask is '
 'where else do you see this lack of motivation Commonly they very easily '
 'identify a number of examples of procrastination penetrating many aspects of '
 'their life This is because issues are rarely confined to the table Rather it '
 'is a life problem that poker is amplifying As we go into the hypnotherapy '
 'part of the session and start to connect memories to this lack of motivation '
 'the players frequently discuss school or college and describe it as being '
 'too easy They often had the experience of being able to coast through exams '
 'where other students had to study hard Professional poker players are in '
 'general highly intelligent which is obviously a great quality to have '
 'However being highly intelligent has in some cases taught players they do '
 'not have to or should not',
 'have to work hard to be successful Some even see it as a badge of honor that '
 'they did not have to put effort into exams in their youth On multiple '
 'occasions I have had clients describe studying as feeling like cheating '
 'These same habits have been held onto and carried over to the poker table '
 'Unfortunately the poker peer group is usually far more competitive and often '
 'success comes down to who puts in the most effective work off the table Many '
 'clients regret not making the most of their educational opportunities and '
 'once they realize that they are doing the same in poker they start to make '
 'adjustments to change this destructive behavior Another theme with clients '
 'and procrastination is a fear of failure As I go deeper into the sessions '
 'many clients describe feeling a comfort in knowing they have not tried their '
 'best Therefore if they fail their ego remains undamaged because it was their '
 'choice not to put in the time or effort This is an interesting concept as '
 'they are effectively guaranteeing failure to protect themselves from feeling '
 'as if they have truly failed Often the root cause of this fear of failure is '
 'tied to how parents treated them through formative years I work through '
 'these issues and help the player understand the reality of the situation '
 'Once they understand the issue at a subconscious level they will describe '
 'feeling as if a barrier has been removed and they are happy to take the '
 'chance and put in more work Rage anger and frustration This is what most of '
 'us think of when we hear the word tilt It could be as simple as feeling '
 'frustrated and playing suboptimally or as intense as smashing laptops '
 'selfharming and throwing away entire bankrolls So why does poker create '
 'these responses in players Poker puts pressure on players mindsets because '
 'at times it can seem so unfair We all know you can play a session perfectly '
 'and it is still possible to lose to an opponent who does not even bother to '
 'look at his cards This can create a huge amount of stress as you often feel '
 'you deserve the pot for being the better player With its combination of bad '
 'beats coolers and other forms of variance poker creates the perfect storm to '
 'ignite anger in some players When I ask these players about anger in other '
 'parts of their life they usually talk about situations such as road rage '
 'issues with strangers cutting in line confrontations etc The anger already '
 'exists poker is only amplifying the issue As I go into the root causes of '
 'these issues the client often mentions being brought up in an angry or '
 'aggressive household As a child the player learned that aggression was the '
 'way to deal with conflict The aggressive behavior recalled by clients has '
 'presented itself in many forms including being beaten by a parent arguments '
 'with other family members and being accused or punished for things they did '
 'not do On a few occasions the ISE was actually as far back as being a '
 'toddler throwing a tantrum and the parents giving in to the behavior The '
 'individuals learned that the angrier they got the more likely it was that '
 'they would get their own way So the aggressiveness at the poker table was '
 'seen in these clients as an attempt to get their own way A background in '
 'other competitive activities and sports or being a sore loser is also a '
 'common theme with players struggling with anger They are used to effort '
 'leading to success and it is very difficult for them to accept a worse '
 'player beating them in a hand or leaving a session with more money The key '
 'to resolving this is accepting that the game is played over the long term '
 'rather than over a hand or session A winning player wins by making correct '
 'decisions that profit them on a quarterly or annual basis rather than in '
 'that days session If the client has a background in sports I often use '
 'analogies to explain the concept in a sports setting An example is Poker is '
 'like a yearlong basketball game the winning side',
 'concept in a sports setting An example is Poker is like a yearlong '
 'basketball game the winning side would never expect to stop their opponents '
 'from scoring at all They win by just having more points at the end of the '
 'game Sessions focused around anger often illicit more emotional memories and '
 'it is quite normal in these',
 'sessions for clients to cry when they uncover the issues that have formed '
 'their behavior Gambling problems Sadly many poker players who are very '
 'profitable at the table choose to gamble away their profits Sometimes they '
 'put themselves in terrible financial situations that affect their poker '
 'career and their family lives In sessions with clients dealing with gambling '
 'issues the biggest trend is trying to win back their losses quickly after a '
 'losing session A player may lose a few buyins in a cash game or bust out of '
 'a tournament and then try and win that money back at the blackjack table in '
 'a few minutes When this works the player leaves with some profit '
 'Unfortunately more often than not the player loses and sometimes even chases '
 'those resultant losses creating a much deeper downswing There are also '
 'players with obvious gambling issues at the table They will get their money '
 'in bad on the turn knowing they are likely behind but just hoping to get '
 'lucky on the river and double up When I explore the root causes of these '
 'issues two common themes are often mentioned The first is struggling with '
 'losing in childhood such as in sports or video games The idea of going home '
 'down for the evening is difficult for them so they attempt to win it back '
 'quickly to save embarrassment The difficulty in losing sometimes has roots '
 'in sibling rivalry or from parental pressure where they feel they need to '
 'win to have the love of their family Again I work through and reduce the '
 'emotions around these memories helping the player to leave the casino '
 'accepting it is a longterm game and results of individual sessions will '
 'likely have little impact on annual results Another theme that I have '
 'noticed with those who gamble heavily is that it often happens after a big '
 'tournament score When we explore this in the sessions many end up talking '
 'about not feeling comfortable with the wealth and would rather go back to '
 'how they were before the big win This lack of comfort with being successful '
 'creates selfsabotage where subconsciously players are depleting their '
 'bankroll through gambling and often poor investment decisions Interestingly '
 'this same tendency can also be seen in lottery winners the more money you '
 'win from the lottery the more likely you are to go bankrupt There seems to '
 'be a trend where people winning sums of money that are large enough to take '
 'them out of their comfort zone will find ways of giving it back If you hit a '
 'big score it is very important to work on accepting the new lifestyle you '
 'have and to be at peace with the dramatic change in your situation The '
 'hardest part is accepting that gambling can be a defense mechanism against '
 'success Once people realize the problem is selfsabotage they can usually '
 'take control of the situation quite effectively Anxiety Many players suffer '
 'from anxiety affecting their poker It may present itself as struggling to '
 'start sessions or having adrenaline responses at the table that cause '
 'physical tells and bad plays Some have sleepless nights after bad sessions '
 'worrying about whether their career is coming to an end Anxiety has '
 'countless origins In sessions I have covered topics as varied as being '
 'turned down by girls in high school to being mugged in the street One theme '
 'regarding poker and anxiety that is often seen is the terrible downswing '
 'that took months to turn around Downswings can haunt players Remembering the '
 'feelings of a bad downswing can be a source of stress at the table and have '
 'a huge impact on the volume played Black Friday and its aftermath has also '
 'affected a large portion of the online community with many players losing '
 'faith in online poker because they feel anxiety around the safety of their '
 'funds As with the other issues covered the key to resolving anxiety at the '
 'table is to understand its source and',
 'resolve the underlying issue Typically sessions working around anxiety are '
 'quite emotional and touch upon difficult subjects Conclusion By its nature '
 'hypnotherapy is a mode of therapy easier to understand through experience '
 'than description I understand that some of the explanations I have given may '
 'be difficult to fully understand if you have never experienced the sensation '
 'However I hope some of the concepts have helped open your eyes to the '
 'potential reasons behind any emotional issues you have at the table By '
 'understanding where problems are coming from you have a far better chance of '
 'removing them from your game It is far more important to remove the issues '
 'that are affecting your game than to only treat the symptoms Remember '
 'hypnosis is just a form of guided meditation that allows you to identify and '
 'resolve any emotional issue that you might have that has impacted you at the '
 'table It is also a tool used to improve your pregame routine with enhanced '
 'visualization By utilizing these methods effectively you should be able to '
 'quickly improve your poker mindset I work with clients worldwide via Skype '

 'Mike Sexton Mike is well respected in the poker world as both a player and '
 'an industry leader and has been a commentator on the World Poker Tour WPT '
 'since its inception Sexton has an impressive poker resume nearly  million in '
 'earnings and was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in ',
 'GREAT PLAYS FROM THE GREAT PLAYERS You are your own company your own boss '
 'and you make all the decisions regarding the company You work when you want '
 'play whatever games and stakes you want promote yourself when you want '
 'meaning playing higher stakes and manage all the companys money And trust me '
 'the money management part is as important if not more so than being a great '
 'player Ive had the privilege to be around the most successful poker players '
 'over many years Im often asked Who are the greatest poker players of all '
 'time My answer to that question is the same one I heard Doyle Brunson give a '
 'reporter when he was once asked that question Doyle said You judge a hunter '
 'by the number of furs he brings home In the old days it was the successful '
 'high stakes cash game players and today in addition to them its the most '
 'successful tournament players especially those winning the HiRoller events '
 'You should recognize that for the most part as the stakes get higher the '
 'players get better There are many factors to being a successful poker player '
 'One of those is one you might not have thought much about dont be afraid of '
 'winning Years ago I was at the Mirage talking to Chip Reese the youngest '
 'player ever inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame when a businessman from '
 'Beverly Hills who knew Chip came over and said Chip do you want to play '
 'some  Seven Card Stud Chip said Sure They started playing and the other guy '
 'was catching all the cards In a half hour the guy was up  He started looking '
 'at his watch and then said Chip Im sorry but I promised my wife Id meet her '
 'for lunch Ive got to go but perhaps we can play again later Chip calmly said '
 'Sure No problem Enjoy lunch and Ill see you later The guy leaves and Chip '
 'turns to me and says Thats why Ive got all the money He must have read my '
 'confused look as he just lost  and he continued Hes typical of most players '
 'most gamblers They win a little and quit But when they lose they go off for '
 'everything Its what I call the human element and why casinos have a much '
 'larger edge than percentages dictate Most people are in that boat they win a '
 'little but lose a lot Chip was one guy who knew how to take it off By that I '
 'mean he would never quit a game that he was winner in if other guys were '
 'playing poorly and going off like a rocket He felt you needed to play '
 'especially when you were winning if others were losing but wanted to keep '
 'playing Be like Chip if given the opportunity dont be afraid to win One of '
 'my favorite quotes Chip graduated from Dartmouth with honors and was going '
 'to Stanford Business and Law School before he stopped in Vegas for a summer '
 'to play poker where he won a fortune He never made it to Stanford A reporter '
 'once asked him Chip I understand you were going to Stanford Law School Why '
 'did you choose poker as a profession over law And Chip responded I decided '
 'to choose the more honorable of the two professions',
 'Number one trait If you asked top players what the number one trait of a '
 'great poker player is most would say They have to have heart In other words '
 'they fight for pots and win a number of them without having the best hand '
 'Bluffing in big bet poker potlimit and nolimit is a powerful asset to a '
 'poker player when its done right Recognize this about bluffing if you get '
 'called every time you bluff youre bluffing too much and if you never get '
 'called youre not bluffing enough Here are some terrific bluffs Ive had the '
 'opportunity to witness Firing three shells Betting on the flop turn and '
 'river is easy to do when you have a hand but not so easy to do when you are '
 'getting called all the way Stu Ungar was playing in a  nolimit holdem cash '
 'game at Vegas World where the Stratosphere now sits during the Americas Cup '
 'of Poker I was walking by the table and he said Sexton come sweat me for a '
 'while Well that was always fun so I took a seat About the third hand after I '
 'sat down Stuey picks up   was first to speak and raises to  One guy calls in '
 'the cutoff seat The flop comes  rainbow Stuey with  in front of him bets  '
 'His opponent with  calls An offsuit  comes on the turn Stuey bets  and the '
 'guy calls On the river the board pairs deuces board now reads  and Stuey '
 'with his  bets  His opponent now goes in the tank After a few minutes he '
 'shows the A  and folds As Stuey was raking in the chips he turns to me and '
 'whispers A lot of guys will bluff at a pot Some will even fire a second '
 'shell but theres not many who will fire three Emptying the clip In Season  '
 'of the WPT in Paris the headsup battle came down to Surinder Sunar and the '
 'rather loudmouth and ballsy Tony G who incidentally turned from poker player '
 'to politician when he won election to parliament in Lithuania in  They were '
 'even in chip count with  each the ante was  and blinds were  Surinder called '
 'on the button with  offsuit and Tony with the   checked his option The flop '
 'was  with two clubs Tony checked Surinder bet  and Tony checkraised to  '
 'Surinder called The turn brought the  giving Tony a twoway straight draw '
 'Tony bet  and again Surinder called The river brought the  and now Tony with '
 'the straight emptied the clip going allin for  probably to make it look like '
 'he was bluffing Surinder thought for a while and folded Speaking of Tony G '
 'and emptying the chamber check out this play I played in a  buyin Hi Roller '
 'tournament in Australia one year and Tony and Phil Ivey were sitting on my '
 'left Players started with  in chips and blinds started at  On the second '
 'hand of the tournament Ivey raised it to  and everyone folded to Tony He '
 'called out of the big blind The flop came  with two hearts Tony checked Ivey '
 'bet  and Tony now went allin for  Without any hesitation Ivey called and '
 'turned up AJ Tony turned up the   The  came on the turn and the Q appeared '
 'on the river giving Tony the flush and the pot He then started screaming to '
 'Ivey I told you I would get you I told you Tony has to work on his how to '
 'win skills but you cant say he doesnt have heart Could you have made the '
 'call Ivey did for all your money on the second hand of the tourney Ivey '
 'didnt even hesitate',
 'Riverraising battle One of the most remarkable riverraising battles in WPT '
 'history took place in the Season  Caribbean Poker Adventure Play was down to '
 'headsup at  when Ryan Daut with  limped on the button with  offsuit and '
 'Isaac Haxton with  checked his option with   The flop was  with two hearts '
 'Haxton checked and Daut bet  which Haxton called The K came on the turn and '
 'both players checked The board paired queens on the river the board now '
 'reads  and Haxton led out for  Daut now raised it to  and Haxton with the '
 'worst hand possible moved allin for  I was wowed how both players fought so '
 'hard to win this pot on the river Both were right in suspecting their '
 'opponent was at it remember neither raised preflop which was probably why '
 'they went to war on the river with all those big cards on the board Theres '
 'probably only a handful of players in the world who would go allin on the '
 'river with the worst hand possible with over  and a WPT title on the line '
 'Haxton won this pot by showing great heart To bluff or not to bluff In poker '
 'as in life timing is everything Here are back to back hands from when play '

 'Kirill Gerasimov with  called on the button with a  offsuit Alan Goehring '
 'with  and  made it  and Kirill called The flop was  with two clubs Alan bet  '
 'and Kirill called The J came on the turn Alan checked and Kirill with the '
 'gutshot straight drawbet  which Alan called The Q appeared on the river and '
 'after Alan checked Kirill moved allin Alan folded Two hands later Kiril '
 'with  limped on the button with   and Alan with  raised to  from the big '
 'blind with QQ The flop came  rainbow Alan with top set checked on the flop '
 'as did Kirill Another  came on the turn and Alan led out for  Kirill then '
 'moved all in and was drawing dead after Alans snap call Bluffs look so good '
 'when they work but here it may have cost Kirill over  the difference '
 'between  and  place and the WPT World Championship title Going with your gut '
 'Poker is a game of incomplete information Your job is to gather information '
 'and then make decisions as to whether to invest your money or not and if so '
 'how much to invest Many times when youre in a pot and facing a tough '
 'decision as to what to do your first instinct is right Ive discovered what '
 'works best for me that you have better results when you go with your '
 'original gut feeling when playing a pot which ties in to what Ive said many '
 'times on the WPT You think long you think wrong In the Season  Bay  Shooting '
 'Star tournament with four players left the blinds were  when Shaun Suller '
 'with  limps from first position with a  offsuit The button and small blind '
 'fold and Mukul Pahuja Season  WPT Player of the Year in the big blind with  '
 'opts to see a free flop with   The flop was  with two hearts Mukul checks '
 'Shaun bets  and Mukul then checkraises to  obviously not believing that '
 'Shaun would have an ace in his hand because he didnt raise preflop Shaun who '
 'didnt believe Mukul had an ace either called the raise The  came on the turn '
 'and going with his gut even though his checkraise was called on the flop '
 'Mukul fired out  Shaun couldnt take the heat and folded Its plays like this '
 'that make it easy to see why Mukul Pahuja was the Season  WPT Player of the '
 'Year',
 'Having good poker feel is a key to being successful at poker Talk about '
 'bluffing Heres one of my favorite hands It happened during Season  at the '
 'WPT Shooting Stars event at the Bay  Casino in San Jose I remember that '
 'event well because it was the first time I made a WPT final table However '
 'this story isnt about me With  players left in the tournament there were six '
 'players at each table To my dismay the two huge chip leaders Alan Sternberg '
 'and Vivek Rajkumar were sitting directly on my left Id never seen Alan '
 'before this tournament but played with him throughout all of the previous '
 'day and was wowed by how good he was He seemed to win pot after pot without '
 'ever showing down a hand the sign of an expert player Vivek an aggressive '
 'and terrific high stakes player was familiar to me I was just trying to '
 'survive these guys who between them raised every pot and get down to ten '
 'players where wed all combine to one table where I thought Id have a good '
 'chance to make the televised final table of six The following hand came up '
 'at  when I was in the small blind Alan the chip leader with nearly  was in '
 'the big blind and Vivek second in chips with  was the first to speak He '
 'opened the pot for  Everyone folded around to Alan in the big blind He now  '
 'to  and Vivek makes the call The flop comes  rainbow Alan leads out for  and '
 'Vivek calls An offsuit  comes on the turn and Alan checks Vivek bets  and '
 'then Alan checkraises it to  Viveks eyes now opened wide as he could '
 'obviously envisioning getting eliminated by the chip leader He went into the '
 'tank for a few minutes and then folded As the dealer started pushing the pot '
 'to Alan and he started to muck his hand Vivek put his hand down on Alans '
 'cards and said Wait a minute Ill give you  in cash if you show me your hand '
 'Vivek reached in his pocket quickly pulled out  in cash and put it on the '
 'table Alan said Youll give me  to show you my hand Vivek said Yes Alan '
 'shrugged said OK and picked up the  He then turned over the  It was a stone '
 'bluff Everyone was stunned Vivek nodded smiled and said Wow Nice play He '
 'then looked at me and said Mike I over paid him to see his hand didnt I I '
 'said You sure did He would have showed it to you for a hundred The table '
 'cracked up Vivek didnt care that the guy outplayed him In fact he admired '
 'him for it But it really bothered him that he paid  to see the hand when  '
 'would have got the job done Such is the mind of a poker player Give Alan '
 'credit he understood the situation With  players left in a tournament that '
 'paid over  to the winner he was the chip leader and Vivek was second in '
 'chips By  preflop betting on the flop and then checkraising on the turn he '
 'could put Vivek in a spot where Vivek would think hed have to play a pot for '
 'his tournament life which would require him to either have a premium hand or '
 'make a huge call Dont make this mistake I played in the Season  Borgata '
 'Poker Open when this hand came up at  Everyone folded around to me in the '
 'small blind I had  which was only  and looked down at A  I raised it to  '
 'Barry Shulman with well over  called from the big blind The flop was   with '
 'two diamonds I made a continuation bet of  and he moved allin I folded and '
 'he said he had   My mistake was not moving allin preflop It was so DUMB Had '
 'I gone allin I would have won  Instead I lost  When youre down to  or less '
 'dont make a small raise preflop where youre most likely then going to make a '
 'continuation bet especially in the small blind when the player in the big '
 'blind has way more chips than you Just move allin with acehigh Youll win the '
 'pot',
 'without a fight most of the time I wont make that mistake again Good read by '
 'both players An interesting hand came up earlier in that same tournament the '
 'Season  Borgata Poker Open between WPT champion Jordan Cristos and Luis '
 'Nargentino The blinds were  Luis in the cutoff with a  made it  to go '
 'Everyone folded to Jordan in the big blind with  who  to  Jordan is known to '

 'Jordan led out for  a tiny bet considering the size of the pot and after '
 'mild consideration Luis raised to  thus setting Jordan allin Jordan then '
 'went in the tank and after some time made the call He turned up  and his '
 'opponent turned up KJ Wow Both opponents read each other perfectly neither '
 'believing the other had an ace while fighting for the pot The turn was a  '
 'and a K appeared on the river knocking Jordan out Sometimes even when you '
 'make a great read for your tournament life like Jordan did you get unlucky '

 'Gus Hansen became a superstar early on the WPT not only because he won three '
 'times but because his aggressive style wowed everyone He reminded me of Stu '
 'Ungar because it seemed liked he played every pot Besides stealing a lot of '
 'blinds and antes when you are ultraaggressive you get paid off when you make '
 'a hand because your opponents always think you are bluffing In the firstever '
 'event on the WPT at Bellagio with five players left blinds were  when John '
 'Hennigan with  limped with Q  Gus with  called on the button with  offsuit '
 'Freddy Deeb with  called from the small blind with KJ and Chris Bigler  '
 'checked with   The flop was  with two spades Freddie and Chris checked and '
 'Hennigan bet  Gus called Freddie folded and Bigler went allin for  Hennigan '
 'called and then Gus moved allin over the top Hennigan then folded Gus '
 'knocked Bigler out with his better two pair A few hands later Freddie with  '
 'raised to  under the gun It was folded around to Gus with  in the big blind '
 'who  to  with a  offsuit thus setting Deeb allin Even though he was getting '
 'about the right price to call unless Gus had specifically two aces Deeb '
 'opted to fold Against a super aggressive player like Gus I think you have to '
 'go allin in this situation even with what you feel might be a marginal hand '
 'like  From stealing to value betting When you talk about a list of the most '
 'aggressive players ever you simply must include Stu Ungar Jack Strauss Gus '
 'Hansen Phil Ivey and Vanessa Selbst and you should also put Galen Hall on '
 'your list The guy is relentless In the Season  WPT World Championship at '
 'Bellagio playing  it was folded to Galen with  on the button and he raised '
 'it to  with  offsuit Tony Gargano with  called from the big blind with  The '
 'flop was  rainbow Galen bet  and Tony called The Q came on the turn and '
 'Galen fired again this time  Tony called On the river a  came off Galen went '
 'from bluffing to value betting as he now bet  Tony called again and his eyes '
 'opened wide as he saw Galens hand Being aggressive wins you a lot of pots '
 'you wouldnt otherwise win',
 'Perhaps Tony thought Galen might have an overpair but if he did feel he had '
 'the best hand I dont really fault Tony for walking the dog here Its a little '
 'dangerous but you can make a lot of money by just calling and letting '
 'aggressive players like Galen keep the lead where they keep bluffing at the '
 'pot Theres a real good chance that Galen would have fired a third shell on '
 'the river even if he did not improve to a pair The continuation bet or lack '
 'thereof The continuation bet where you raise preflop and bet on the flop no '
 'matter what comes is one of the most powerful plays in poker Its tough for '
 'an opponent to keep playing when they miss the flop which will happen '
 'around  of the time if someones continuing to bet in front of them Heres a '
 'hand from Season  at Bellagio Playing  Phil Ivey on his record setting  WPT '
 'final table with  opened UTG for  with  Everyone folded around to John '
 'Caridad who with  called from the big blind with KQ The flop was  John '
 'checked as did Ivey A queen came on the turn and again both players checked '
 'The  came on the river and Caridad bet  Ivey paid him off Ivey was steaming '
 'because he didnt make the continuation bet on the flop where he likely would '
 'have won the pot and then paid off  after giving his opponent a free card '
 'Its not often that you see Ivey make mistakes Many players would think they '
 'were unlucky that their opponent outdrew them on the turn but Ivey didnt '
 'blame bad luck He knew he lost this hand because he played it poorly From '
 'attempted steal to getting lucky In the Season  BestBet Open in Jacksonville '
 'FL the blinds were  when Darren Elias with  raised it to  up front with AK '
 'James Calderaro with  right behind him made the call with   and everyone '
 'else folded The flop was  rainbow Elias bet  and Calderaro in an effort to '
 'take the pot away raised it to  Elias called Ooops The turn card was the  '
 'giving Calderaro a flush draw Both players checked Raising on the flop gets '
 'you a free card on the turn most of the time The Q came on the river Elias '
 'checked and Calderaro bet  Elias paid him off and did a doubletake when he '
 'saw what Calderaro raised him with on the flop Attempted steals are fine but '
 'getting lucky to hit runner runner to win the pot is really sweet Two aces '
 'Stu Ungar once said to me Sexton all two aces are good for is to win a small '
 'pot or lose a big one In the Season  Parx Open Poker Classic playing  after '
 'two folds Chris VanDeursen with  opened the pot for  with the   It was '
 'folded to the small blind where Andre Nyffeler with  looked down at AA and '
 'just called a play Im not fond of as it prices in the big blind with big '
 'pairs you usually want to charge your opponents to see the flop Chris Lee in '
 'the big blind with  with  also just called The flop was  rainbow Andre led '
 'out for  Lee with three tens just called as did VanDeursen The  came on the '
 'turn and Andre with his aces bet  Lee now raised it to  VanDeursen folded '

 'Be careful what you wish for In the Season  World Poker Finals at Foxwoods '

 'players a flush Both checked The  came on the river and Kathy bet  EG went '

 'its better to miss your hand This hand reminds me of one of my favorite '
 'poker stories and an important one for you to remember especially if youre a '
 'PotLimit Omaha player When drawing to a kinghigh flush in PLO a wise man '
 'once said I saw a man lose seven riverbottom farms drawing to kinghigh '
 'flushes in PLO He missed the first four and made the last three Leading out '
 'and blocking bets can pay off During the Season  Festa Al Lago at Bellagio '
 'playing  Chris Loveland with  raised to  from the cutoff with  offsuit It '
 'was folded to Andreas Walnum with  in the big blind who called with   Many '
 'would debate about calling out of position with   The flop came  with two '
 'spades Andreas checked and Chris made the continuation bet for  Andreas '
 'called The  came on the turn and now Andreas led out for  which was less '
 'than one third of the pot When an opponent leads out in this situation it '
 'doesnt pass the smell test to me Why didnt he raise on the flop And if he '
 'had a good hand why wouldnt he check on the turn Chris folded and Andreas '
 'picked up the pot Theres an old poker axiom that Andreas utilized here If '
 'youre going to check and call its probably better to just lead out and bet '
 'Still when an opponents action doesnt pass the smell test you might try '
 'doing something besides folding Floating an expert play Floating is when you '
 'call a bet on the flop with no hand and no draw with the intention of taking '
 'the pot away from your opponent on a later street Its a terrific play when '
 'applied in the right situation for example when you know your opponent '
 'always makes a continuation bet after raising preflop but then checks on the '
 'turn when called on the flop but its a play that only the best players will '
 'use because it takes a lot of heart to make Its beautiful to watch when it '
 'works In the Season  WPT World Championship with five players left and the '
 'blinds  action was folded around to Matt Matros with  in the small blind and '
 'he limped with a  offsuit Hasan Habib with  with a  checked his option The '
 'flop was KQQ Matros led out for  and Habib called floated The  appeared on '
 'the turn and Matros checked Habib now bet  and won the pot when Matros '
 'folded Habib correctly figured that if Matros had any kings or queens in his '
 'hand or any pair he would have raised preflop Knowing that a float was '
 'perfect in this situation Knowing when to call Doyle Brunson has been the '
 'man in poker for many years Hes a twotime WSOP world champion',

 'exciting win for me in WPT history was when Doyle won the Season  Legends of '

 'day is the oldest player to ever win a WPT title At the Legends Doyle was '
 'headsup with Lee Watkinson with the winner getting  Playing  Watkinson with  '

 'checkraised it to  and then Lee went allin much to the delight of Doyle who '
 'doubled up after an  hit on the river Checking and calling on the flop was '
 'the part that confused Lee He just didnt put Doyle on a strong hand To give '
 'you an idea of how clever Doyle is I saw him play a hand  years ago in a '

 'showed a jack and as he was folding said Doyle youre so lucky As Doyle was '
 'raking in the pot he smiled and said I know it That hand made a big '
 'impression on me as it got me thinking about maximizing opportunities Doyle '
 'knew the guy made a straight on the turn when he raised and rather than '
 'raise him back with the nuts on the turn as many players would do and split '
 'the pot he just called hoping the board would pair on the river This might '
 'give him a chance to bet on the river and win the pot which is exactly what '

 'to see if I could find a better way to teach my students how to develop the '
 'fundamental skills required to s ucceed at poker While watching training '
 'videos of world class players play in real time is great I thought the lack '
 'of interactivity was a problem I decided to develop interactive quizzes so '
 'my students could compare their skills to mine in real time get ting '
 'immediate feedback on spots where I disagree with their strategies After '
 'putting in just a bit of time working on their games my students started '
 'seeing improvements and eventually significant life changing wins Jonathan '

 'protecting against flush draws The only time a large bet does not maximize '

 'It is important to first try to figure out the small blinds limping strategy '
 'In the high stakes games at this point in time most players limp with their '
 'entire playable range from the small blind when everyone fo lds to them '
 'Keeping that in mind against an extremely wide range you should raise your '
 'best hands for value While A  is far from premium it can extract significant '
 'value from the opponents worse A x hands as well as various hands containing '
 'two some what coordinated cards If for some reason you thought your opponent '
 'planned to limp with the intention of reraising you should be more inclined '
 'to check to ensure you get to see the flop When choosing your raise size '
 'pick an amount he would call with s ome portion of his range while forcing '
 'him to fold some amount of the time Notice if you minraise he will call '
 'essentially every time and he wont be making much of a mistake due to his '
 'excellent pot odds However if you raise too large he will only put money in '
 'with h ands that dominate yours ',

 ' Score  Check  Points Bet   Points Bet   Points Bet   Points Both betting '
 'and checking are fine but in general you should use a small bet that forces '
 'your opponent to play somewhat straightforwardly by making most of his junk '
 'and m arginal hands fold While checking behind is perfectly fine you will '
 'often find your self in a difficult spot if he bets the turn and river Also '
 'you have lots of backdoor draws so betting can never be too bad unless you '

 'checking with the intention of giving up is fine If you think he will rarely '

 'is an interesting spot because in reality you sh ould likely continue '
 'betting the turn with Q  and   but there is no way for your opponent to know '
 'that is the strategy you are likely to employ You sh ould however '
 'definitively check behind with T T which improved to a set When figuring out '
 'which hands to bluff on the river you should strive to have a  in your hand '
 'because having a  ma kes it much less likely your opponent has the straight '
 'While your overall river range should rarely raise because most of it will '
 'be either marginal made hand s or junk you should raise as a bluff from time '
 'to time because there are also a few premium hands you want to raise for '
 'value Since most of your hands that have a  also have a pair it is fine to '
 'bluff with all your unpaired  although that may not be the case if you use '
 'an overly aggressive preflop strategy that includes raising all combinations '
 'of   and   It is difficult to know which raise si ze is best but in general '
 'most players will call a raise with the same range when faced with an all in '
 'or almost an all in often making the smaller size ideal when bluffing just '
 'dont let your opponents know your strategy You raised to  Your opponent '
 'folded Kc  which he was also bluffing with It is impossible to know whether '

 'While calling may seem like a good idea because in general you dont want to '
 'play a large pot with A J against what is likely a strong early position '
 'raise since all your opponents play well it is too likely that someone yet '
 'to act will reraise forcing you to fold Also the initial raiser could easily '
 'have yo u dominated which is not where you want to be So folding is a '
 'perfectly viable option Reraising is also a decent option While it will '
 'often result in the initial raiser going all in it will put him in a tough '
 'spot with the weaker part of his range such as   AJ KQ and   That said if he '
 'is simply going to go all in with his entire preflop raising range either '
 'calling or folding is a much better strategy because you will usually not be '
 'getting the correct pot odds to justify calling an all in',
 ' You  to  Everyone folds around to the preflop raiser who pushes allin for  '

 ' Score  Fold  Points Call  Points The first thing you should consider when '
 'deciding whether or not to call an all in are your pot odds This time you '
 'have to put in roughly  to win a pot that will be  if you call meaning you '
 'need to win  of the time to break even  While calling may be tempting '
 'because you beat all your opponents bluffs and are flipping against the '
 'medium pairs you must make an easy fold Against a reasonable range '
 'including   A Js A Qo and K Qs your AJo only has  equity If the opponent is '
 'instead pushing   A Ts A   A Jo KJs and K Qo your AJo still only has  equity '
 'making it roughly break even So unless the opponent is an absolute lunatic '
 'you should fold You decided to fold Your opponent had T T one of the few '
 'hands you were flipping against Even though you should have called if you '
 'knew your opponents exact hand folding will work out well for you in the '
 'long run because you were in bad shape against your opponents range',

 'Both calling and folding J  are perfectly fine options when facing a small '
 'raise from late position but when playing against strong opponents who are '
 'not raising with only premium hands it is important to develop a bluffing '
 'range In general you should call with a decently wide range from the big '
 'blind when facing a small raise so if your opponent is inclined to  bet or '
 'fold when facing a reraise your bluffs s hould be hands that are on the cusp '
 'of playability This often includes offsuit K x Qx and suited J x hands While '

 'your b et size you have to determine if you are going to bet once with the '
 'intention of giving up if called or multiple times If you plan to bet once '
 'you should bet large but if you plan to barrel on various turns you should '
 'bet smaller Also you will tend to find that most strong players are '
 'unwilling to release even marginal pairs to one bet which should lead you to '

 'have preferred to see a di amond on the turn a King is not the worse card as '
 'it gives you a gutshot straight draw While betting on this turn feels a bit '
 'optimistic because your opponent will never fold an Ace and most of his '
 'Queens should have at least a gutshot straight draw to go along with it if '
 'you consider your entire range you will see that you have a significant '
 'range advantage Assuming you want to remain balanced you should continue '
 'betting this hand mainly because you certainly want to keep betting your '
 'sets and two pairs When choosing your bet size you should choose an amount '
 'that either sets up a reasonably sized river all in or ensures your opponent '
 'will fold all his non premium hands You bet  This time the opponent folded '
 'Qd  which is one of the hands your turn bet targeted If your opponent called '
 'your turn bet you should almost certainly continue betting the river again '

 'prove you wrong The only time I ever won a pot against Dominik Nitsche was '
 'with this play He is  times the poker player I am but when I check raised A '
 'K on a similar board I knew hed underestimate the value portion of my range '
 'and sure enough he called down with a weak pair In this hand however your '
 'kicker is weak So you should call to control the pot size Its also a good '

 'behind with  big blinds each Should you  Check Bet ',
 ' Score  Check  Points Bet   Points There is a great deal of merit in leading '
 'the turn here On the flop your opponent was likely to bet with his entire '
 'range because you only completed from the big blind and then checked to him '
 'On the turn however he is likely to check back many draws thinking you often '
 'have an Ace or an  that isnt folding due to the innocuous turn card If you '
 'lead however you must bet the river Otherwise you perfectly define your hand '
 'for him allowing him to make optimal bluffs and value bets In this ha nd '
 'against a solid opponent you should check Your opponent is a little too '
 'solid to always pay off a turn bet with just a draw He may not pay off a '
 'thin river value bet as often as the young gunslingers do either',
 ' You check He bets   Shou ld you Call Raise to ',
 ' Score  Call  Points Raise to   Points You can check raise turned flush '
 'draws on occasion in tough cash games especially if your stack is a little '
 'shallower In that case you are playing with the same player s consistently '
 'and dont want your check raising range on the turn and river to only contain '
 'value hands In a tournament setting where you will play only a few hands '
 'with your specific opponent there is no need to work in bluffs like that',

 ' Score  Check  Points Bet   Points If you lead out it will look exactly like '

 'induce a raise from their opponents missed draws The only problem is thats '
 'an extremely difficult play to time correctly You could easily bet and then '
 'call a raise only to give A Q a ton of your stack Im not good enough to '

 ' You check Your opponent bets  Should you  Fold Call',
 ' Score  Fold  Points Call  Points I am a huge fan of folding in this spot If '
 'there is one thing I have been working at this last year its been not to '
 'give away a river bet At face value this seems like a basic call You have '
 'tons of chips there are multiple missed draws possible you have top pair Why '
 'are you folding Well pocket Aces on avera ge makes you about   big blinds '
 'per deal Have you ever heard a guy say Oh I could win poker tournaments too '
 'if I got dealt Aces four times like that one kid Well every time you bet  '
 'big blinds on the river and get called by a worse hand you j ust dealt '
 'yourself Aces Every time you call a  big blind bet on the river and are '
 'wrong you just got dealt Aces while you were in the restroom Its actually '
 'worse than that but to keep things simple it is a good visualization '
 'technique to realize ho w important river bets are to both win and save '
 'Think about it What is he betting that you beat Missed draws Think of all '
 'the missed draws List them out K Q of hearts How many combinations are there '
 'of that hand One The answer is one Now how many AK combinations are there '
 'There are eight Two suited combinations and six unsuited ones KQs K Js K  Q '
 'Js Q  Q     All those missed flush draws account for exactly one type of top '
 'pair You havent even gotten into the A Q and AJ combinations Also most of '
 'his weaker Aces that he would continue betting have made two pair',
 ' If you dont know what to do on the river just fold People are awful at '
 'bluffing and they call too often Most people subconsciously pick this up and '
 'adj ust their river betting ranges to expect more calls Dont pay them off',
 ' Stuck In The Small Blind You have the pleasure of having a young German pro '
 'who is ridiculously good at poker seated to your direct left He seems to '
 'have an answer to everyones standard plays He is focused and disciplined It '
 'folds around to you in the small blind with the pro in the big blind You '
 'have J  Should you  Fold Call Raise to  Raise to ',
 ' Score  Fold  Points Call  Points Raise to   Points Raise to   Points I '
 'raised to  The young German reg looked at me like I was an idiot He grumbled '
 'You really dont want to play with me do you and folded He was right I didnt '
 'want to play with him and thanks to the mathema tics of this play I didnt '
 'have to I have asked many world class professionals with which hands they '
 'would continue against a  big blind raise Most tell me that if they knew '
 'nothing about their opponent they would fold hands as strong as A  I proba '
 'bly would too because nine times out of ten the  big blind raise is a huge '
 'hand thats afraid of being cracked like Q Q or J J However if they are '
 'folding A  they are begging to be exploited They are folding  of the time or '
 'more and this raise despite its large size only needs to succeed  of the '
 'time to be immediately profitable If your opponents have a hole in their '
 'game where they are going to fold too often you might as well put them in '
 'that spot and make them fold too often',
 ' The Un changing Board This hand took place in Las Vegas in a small stakes '
 'tournament at Planet Hollywood The player in the big blind is a bored '
 'regular from around the area The action folds around to you with   in the '
 'cutoff and you raised to  Only the big blind calls The flop comes Jh  He '
 'checks You bet half pot with your backdoor draws and he calls The turn is '
 'the Jh  essentially changing nothing He checks to you with  effective big '

 'Check Bet  Bet ',

 'barrel in this situation but Ive gradually added it to my repertoire The '
 'reas on I have done this is because deep stacked regulars will not fold Ace '
 'high on hit ormiss boards like this one anymore They also never fold Ace '
 'high from the big blind to a preflop raise That means on this flop the vast '
 'majority of the opponents cal ling range is dominated by Ace highs that are '
 'unlikely to call a second barrel So barrel away just as you would with your '
 'strong hands and pick up the almost free pot You bet  and your opponent '
 'quickly folded',

 'Introduction There has been a lot written recently particularly in eBook '
 'format regarding how to beat small stakes poker tournaments Most books '
 'suggest that you either play an overly tight strategy hoping to trap your '
 'opponents who never fold or an overly loose strategy hoping to steal lots of '
 'pots from your opponents who fold too often In reality you should play a '
 'strategy that maximally exploits your specific opponents I hate to be the '
 'bearer of bad news but there is no silver bullet as many of these eBooks '
 'suggest Guides that aim to teach you a default set of hands to play from '
 'each position are certain to fail you in the long run because each and every '
 'time you sit at a poker table you play against a different set of opponents '
 'For example if you elect to play an overly tight style and you employ that '
 'strategy against players who will never pay you off when you make a strong '
 'hand you will blind out guaranteeing failure If you instead play overly '
 'loose against opponents who play in a manner that traps you you will spew '
 'off your stack You should not accept the idea that sometimes your strategy '
 'will simply fail when you get unlucky to be against the wrong type of '
 'opponents It is also worth mentioning that you should raise with a '
 'drastically different range based on your stack size Hands such as  and   '
 'are excellent when you have a',
 'deep stack because of their potential to win a large number of chips if you '
 'flop well However if you have a  big blind stack they become quite poor '
 'especially from early position because if you get lucky to flop well you '
 'cannot win enough to justify losing the amount you lose when you dont '
 'connect with the flop or when you get reraised and have to fold before the '
 'flop One of the best things you can do to improve your tournament skills is '
 'to learn how to increase your levels aggression That being said aggression '
 'must be implemented intelligently to be effective The key to using '
 'aggression effectively is knowing when to apply it and when to get out of '
 'the way To get a free  video and  PDF from me with tips on how to increase '
 'your levels of aggression visit FloatTheTurncomincreasingaggression The '
 'secret to success in poker is to tailor your playing style to your specific '
 'opponents Playing according to a simple hand chart doesnt work because your '
 'opponents are not all playing the same way Also you will find that most of '
 'these books lay out an overly simplistic strategy for playing after the flop '
 'Again this will fail miserably because it doesnt account for opponents '
 'tendencies',
 'As a simple example suppose you raise with A J to  big blinds out of your  '
 'big blind stack from middle position and only the player in the big blind '
 'calls The flop comes J   Your opponent checks Against almost all opponents '
 'you should make a continuation bet of around  big blinds which is roughly  '
 'of the size of the pot Lets assume you make that bet and your opponent calls '
 'The turn is the J   Q Your opponent checks At this point your play should '
 'vary widely based on your opponents tendencies Against tight players who '
 'will fold almost all hands worse than yours if you bet you should check '
 'forcing them to stay in the pot with lots of hands that you crush Against '
 'loose players who never fold any made hand or draw to a turn bet you should '
 'bet to get value from worse made hands and to protect your hand from various '
 'river cards that could give your opponent the hand Lets assume you are '
 'against a loose player and you decide to bet  of the pot again Your opponent '
 'calls The river is the J   Q  Your opponent checks Your play now depends on '
 'how prone your opponent is to call on the river with his marginal hands If '
 'he will call a river bet with an overly wide range of marginal made hands '
 'such as  and  you should make a thin value bet It is important to bet an '
 'amount that is likely to get called by these junky made hands In this '
 'situation a bet of around  of the size of the pot should get called a large '
 'portion of the time If your opponent will usually fold all hands worse than '
 'yours besides perhaps JT and  you should probably check',
 'behind because if you get called it is too likely that you no longer have '
 'the best hand This simple example shows how mindlessly thinking I have top '
 'pair so I should bet does not work If you were to bet the turn and river in '
 'this scenario against a tight opponent you are almost certainly burning '
 'money because he will only call you with a better hand If you fail to make a '
 'thin value bet against a calling station on the river you are leaving money '
 'on the table If you fail to alter your play based on your opponents '
 'tendencies you will not win the maximum your winning hands and you will lose '
 'more than you should with your losing hands My goal is to teach you to crush '
 'your opponents not merely win a small amount from them by playing '
 'robotically As with all of my poker training content my goal is to teach you '
 'to think for yourself so you will be able to select the best possible play '
 'in all situations you encounter for the rest of your poker career While I '
 'could certainly teach you to play a like a mindless robot grinding out small '
 'amounts of money in the small stakes games my goal is to teach you to be a '
 'big winner I want to see you succeed and move up to the middle and high '
 'stakes games where you have the opportunity to win lifechanging money While '
 'there are no preflop hand charts in this book which I am sure many of you '
 'have come to expect from poker books in your quest to find one that actually '
 'works I provide numerous examples that will give you a solid grasp of how I '
 'attack small stakes tournaments For a more indepth analysis of my default '
 'poker strategies I strongly suggest you check out my bestselling tournament '
 'book series Secrets of Professional Tournament Poker You can get the '
 'audiobook version of Volume  for FREE simply by',
 'clicking the link and following the instructions Nothing makes me happier '
 'than to hear from my students who started off small and grinded their way to '
 'the top as I did many years ago when I deposited  onto PartyPoker and rose '
 'through the ranks eventually winning large sums of money and experiencing '
 'success in all aspects of life If I can do it you can too I aim to set you '
 'on the right path so you do not waste countless hours listening to authors '
 'who lay out a flawed formula for you to blindly follow While some of these '
 'simple strategies may have worked  years ago when many players were awful at '
 'poker they will not work today because the average player is competent at '
 'the game During the first few years of my poker career I played using what '
 'was effectively an advanced system I eventually came to the realization that '
 'I was not winning at the highest rate that I thought was possible While '
 'following an intelligently crafted system will likely win you money it will '
 'only win you a little Playing like a robot in todays games does not produce '
 'significant results You must realize that if you win at roughly  return on '
 'investment which is about the highest rate you can expect to win at by '
 'following a mindless strategy you will break even or lose money after paying '
 'the rake For example if you normally play  live tournaments and  of the '
 'buyin goes to the rake which is fairly standard in most casinos a  return on '
 'your  investment means that you will win  minus the  you paid to the rake '
 'making you a  loser even though you are better than your opponents',
 'If instead you achieve a  return on investment which can only be '
 'accomplished by getting well out of your comfort zone and blatantly '
 'exploiting your opponents weaknesses you will quickly progress from the '
 'small stakes games to the middle stakes games where you can start winning '
 'serious money Notice by winning  per game even after paying  for rake you '
 'profit  on average While  per game may not sound like a lot if you play well '
 'and win that amount on average every time you play your bankroll will '
 'quickly grow',
 'Focus on your opponents In order to win large amounts you must focus on your '
 'opponents You have to keep your eyes and ears open actively observing their '
 'tendencies If you only pay attention to your own two cards your position and '
 'your chip stack you are certain to fail in the long run Fortunately for you '
 'in the small stakes games most of your opponents will be oblivious to what '
 'you are doing giving you free reign to do whatever you want You must make a '
 'point to diligently pay attention the action during each and every hand that '
 'takes place at the table Paying attention only when you are involved in a '
 'pot will not give you enough reliable information to get well out of line '
 'which is mandatory if you are to maximize your equity You have to be mindful '
 'while playing poker If you are mindlessly grinding you are not playing '
 'optimally I strongly suggest that you either take mental notes about '
 'everything you see your opponents doing assuming your memory is good or '
 'write notes in a notepad if your memory is bad Because I recognize and '
 'accept that my memory is bad I write down every hand I play as well as a '
 'decent amount of the hands I witness at the poker table While I occasionally '
 'get teased for actually taking the game seriously I exploit my opponents '
 'better than almost anyone That seems like a fine tradeoff to me',
 'When taking notes on your opponents it is especially important to record '
 'what each specific player does incorrectly For example if you see someone on '
 'separate occasions making very small and very large continuation bets on the '
 'flop you should assume that those bet sizes mean something If you pay '
 'attention long enough you will be able to see a few showdowns and figure out '
 'if a particular bet size correlates with a hand of a specific strength Once '
 'you figure out what your specific opponent is doing incorrectly you can take '
 'steps to exploit his weakness which is how you will produce a large profit '
 'in the long run For example if you know your opponent continuation bets '
 'small on the flop with strong hands and large with weak hands you should '
 'fold all of your nonpremium made hands to small continuation bets When '
 'facing a large continuation bet you should raise with your weak hands '
 'forcing your opponent to fold earning you the pot With your strong hands you '
 'should call because if you raise your opponent will fold making it '
 'impossible to extract additional value on the turn and river Before moving '
 'forward there is a concept you must grasp if you want to win at any form of '
 'poker If you do not understand this concept you are certain to fail once you '
 'progress beyond the small stakes Pay attention this is important You must '
 'make a point to always think in terms of ranges meaning you must accept that '
 'your opponents will play various hands in a similar manner For example if a',
 'supertight player raises from first position you should not assume he has a '
 'specific hand such as AK You should assume he has a range of hands such as '
 'AA KK QQ J J and AK You can then narrow that range as the hand progresses '
 'based on your opponents actions Obviously looser players will have much '
 'wider ranges on all betting rounds making them more difficult to play '
 'against There will be more discussion about ranges throughout this book '
 'simply because you cannot analyze a poker hand without assigning your '
 'opponent a range When you have your opponents range crushed such as when you '
 'have a straight and you think the best hand your opponent can realistically '
 'have is one pair you do NOT want him to fold You win at poker by making your '
 'opponent fold when you are beat and by getting value when you are decently '
 'far ahead Suppose you raise to  out of your  stack at  with A T from middle '
 'position and only the big blind calls The flop comes A   The pot is  Your '
 'opponent who you know nothing about decides to bet into you for  This is a '
 'scenario where if you raise your opponent will probably only call with a '
 'flush draw or a strong made hand unless he is a calling station who cannot '
 'fold any sort of marginal holding We will assume that is not the case This '
 'means that if you raise and get called you are either against a draw that '
 'has roughly  equity meaning you are not too far ahead or against what is '
 'likely a better made hand meaning you are way',
 'behind Even though you probably have the best hand with your top pair when '
 'you raise your opponents flop bet and he continues in the pot you are '
 'usually in either marginal or bad shape Of course if your opponent decides '
 'to reraise you are in even worse shape A much better play is to call forcing '
 'your opponent to stay in the pot with a wide range of hands that you crush '
 'including A  and   While you will occasionally get outdrawn you will also '
 'extract huge amounts of value by giving your opponent a chance to make '
 'mistakes on the turn and river Notice that your opponent may think his A  is '
 'the best hand and continue betting on the turn and river for value because '
 'he may assume you would always raise with a better hand on the flop He could '
 'also have total air such as K  and decide to continue bluffing because he '
 'knows you cant have the nut flush draw or simply because he feels like '
 'running a bluff By raising the flop and forcing your opponent to fold his '
 'hands that are drawing thin you force him to play perfectly You make money '
 'by exploiting your opponents errors not by inducing him to play well',
 'The three player types who play small stakes tournaments There are primarily '
 'three types of players who play small stakes tournaments There are those who '
 'play too many hands those who play too few hands and those who play roughly '
 'the correct amount of hands in an intelligent manner While many of these '
 'players have similar traits they all have distinguishing characteristics '
 'that allow you to syphon away their money assuming you are paying attention '
 'and adjusting intelligently',
 'Those who play too many hands While players who play too many hands come in '
 'numerous varieties you can generally break this category of players down '
 'into those who play too many hands too passively and those who play too many '
 'hands too aggressively Each player type must be looked at separately because '
 'you exploit them in drastically different ways',
 'Those who play too many hands too passively The main type of player you will '
 'encounter in small stakes poker tournaments are those who play too many '
 'hands too passively These players frequently limp in and call raises with a '
 'wide range of marginal hands hoping to connect well with the flop It is '
 'important to realize that these players usually have marginal hands when '
 'they act in a passive manner because they almost always raise and reraise '
 'with their premium hands Just because someone is active does not mean they '
 'are aggressive It is quite easy to be involved in many pots while still only '
 'investing significant money with premium hands That is exactly what these '
 'players do They try to make a premium postflop hand cheaply before investing '
 'a lot of money Of course the type of hand that each specific player '
 'perceives as strong varies quite a bit Some will only want to put a lot of '
 'money in the pot with the nuts and others will blast their stack in with any '
 'junky top pair As stated earlier you must pay attention to your opponents so '
 'you can develop a plan for how you should exploit them It is impossible to '
 'develop a sound plan if you have no clue what your opponents are doing',
 'You beat this type of player by assuming they play straightforwardly Of '
 'course they will bluff you from time to time but you will usually make the '
 'right decision if you assume they are playing in a faceup manner When this '
 'type of player calls your bets you should tend to assume they have marginal '
 'made hands This should lead you to value bet relentlessly especially with '
 'hands that have their calling range crushed Whenever you have a decent top '
 'pair or better you should almost always continue value betting Always be '
 'sure to size your bets such that your opponent can realistically call with '
 'worse made hands When this type of player decides to apply pressure you '
 'should tend to get out of the way unless you have a premium holding that is '
 'in good shape against their bettingraising range If you know your opponent '
 'is betting and raising with mostly nut and nearnut hands it is tough to be '
 'ahead of that range Do not fall into the habit of paying these players off '
 'with strong but crushed holdings such as top pair For example suppose you '
 'raise to  big blinds with K Q out of your  big blind stack and a loose '
 'passive player calls on the button The flop comes K T  You should usually '
 'make a continuation bet of around  big blinds If your opponent calls you '
 'should usually bet again on most turns Suppose the turn is the K T   You '
 'should bet around  big blinds If your opponent calls you can assume he has a '
 'worse K a T or a draw If he raises you can confidently fold assuming he has '
 'you beat with some sort of two pair or set that he decided to slow play on '
 'the flop This turn bet allows you to extract value when you are ahead while '
 'also getting relatively',
 'accurate information that will let you know when you are crushed Assuming '
 'the river is a reasonably safe card any card besides an A J or  you should '
 'make a fairly small value bet of around  big blinds or  of the size of the '
 'pot You are making this bet with the assumption that your opponent will fold '
 'all of his missed draws call with all of his one pair hands and either call '
 'or raise with hands that are better than yours While the T may appear to be '
 'a scary river card because it improves middle pair into trips you should not '
 'automatically assume that your opponent has exactly the one hand that beats '
 'yours Of course if your opponent raises your river value bet unless you have '
 'some sort of read that lets you know with a high degree of certainty that he '
 'is bluffing you should fold It is important to realize that when you value '
 'bet on some of these rivers such as a T     or  you could have the worst '
 'hand However you will find that your opponent will call your small bet often '
 'enough with a losing hand to justify making the value bet When value betting '
 'your bet needs to get called by a worse hand at least  of the time to make '
 'the bet profitable In this scenario it almost certainly will succeed at '
 'least  of the time That being said if you know your opponent only calls '
 'river bets with premium hands you should strongly consider checking with the '
 'intention of calling if your opponent bets on these marginal rivers If the '
 'river is a bad card an A J or  you should usually check and see what your '
 'opponent does If he bets you should vary your play between calling and '
 'folding depending on your opponents specific tendencies although folding is '
 'usually the',
 'intelligent play Whenever the river is great for your opponents range and '
 'bad for your hand if your passive opponent bets you should usually assume he '
 'improved to a hand that crushes yours Notice that if you bet significantly '
 'larger perhaps around  of the size of the pot which is what most nonthinking '
 'players do your opponent will fold most of his one pair hands meaning he '
 'will usually only call when you are beat By making a large bet you force '
 'your opponent to play well which is a disaster for you Remember you dont '
 'want to make it easy for your opponent to play well You will often find that '
 'some of these players will call on the flop and the turn with a wide range '
 'hoping to either find out where they are at by the river or improve their '
 'junky holdings such as A high or bottom pair into a strong hand Against '
 'these players you should be very prone to make river bluffs especially if '
 'you know that your opponent will raise on an earlier betting round with his '
 'premium holdings meaning when he calls your flop and turn bet he usually has '
 'a marginal made hand that he will fold to a sizable river bet Against these '
 'players you should usually make your river bets a bit larger than in the '
 'previous example because you are trying to make your opponent fold most of '
 'his marginal hands The last thing you want is to bet small on the river with '
 'a bluff and have your opponent call with bottom pair For example suppose you '
 'raise to  big blinds out of your  big blind stack with Q ',
 'J A player who you know likes to stick around until the river with a wide '
 'range calls on the button The flop comes K   You bet  big blinds and your '
 'opponent calls The turn is the K    You bet  big blinds and your opponent '
 'calls The river is the K     Should you bet or check If you decide to bet '
 'how much should you bet Seeing how you lose to almost all hands and your '
 'opponent could realistically fold a   A or marginal pocket pair if you bet '
 'you should make a somewhat sizable bet of around  big blinds or  of the size '
 'of the pot This will force your opponent to put in a significant amount of '
 'his stack to make a hero call that will only win if you are bluffing Of '
 'course if you are known to be a habitual bluffer you should be more prone to '
 'give up when you miss On the other hand if you are known to be a tight '
 'player you should certainly bluff Always be sure to factor in the way your '
 'opponent perceives you before making any bet Interestingly if you improve to '
 'a straight or flush on the river you should bet for value Since you expect '
 'your opponent to fold to a large bet you should make a smaller bet of '
 'around  of the size of the pot If you improve to middle pair you should also '
 'make a  pot bet for value because you expect most of your opponents range to '
 'be worse than your middle pair This is an example of playing a blatantly '
 'exploitable strategy which means that if your opponent knows what you are '
 'doing he can crush you If he knows that you are bluffing when you bet  pot '
 'he can simply call with his entire range of made hands',
 'and raise with all of his trash When you bet  pot he can fold all of his '
 'marginal made hands Clearly if your opponent knows what you are doing you '
 'have a major problem However you will rarely stumble into this exact '
 'situation too often You will find that you rarely make it to the river and '
 'when you do your opponents will not be paying too much attention to your '
 'exact bet sizes Most small stakes players dont pay attention to what is '
 'going on at the table when they arent involved in the pot which is one of '
 'the main reasons why most of them never progress beyond the small stakes '
 'games If you play with the same group of strong players on a regular basis '
 'you should tend to make bets that are unexploitable or at least much more '
 'difficult to exploit This means that you should make bets of the same size '
 'with all of your hands whether they are strong or weak In the previous '
 'situation you should tend to make the  pot bet because most of the time you '
 'will want this type of player to fold on the river In general you want to '
 'figure out the result you want most of the time and tailor your bet size to '
 'achieve that result Some players of this type will display obvious bet '
 'sizing tells meaning they make a specific bet size with their strong hands '
 'and a vastly different bet size with their weak hands For example they may '
 'bet  pot with their middle and bottom pair hands and  pot with their top '
 'pair or better hands Others will raise or checkraise with top pair or better '
 'while calling with their worse made hands Whatever they do try to',
 'figure out what their bet sizes mean and act accordingly until you have a '
 'reason to believe that they have altered their betting patterns which will '
 'likely never happen Once you figure out what your opponents are doing '
 'incorrectly you can adjust your strategy to exploit them',
 'Those who play too many hands too aggressively This type of player is '
 'similar to the previous type of player in that they play a wide range of '
 'hands and see a lot of flops However they tend to do so in an aggressive '
 'manner which makes them much more difficult to play against than their '
 'passive counterparts Instead of being able to assume these players play in '
 'an almost blatantly faceup manner you have to assume they are bluffing at '
 'least some percentage of the time This makes it much more difficult to '
 'accurately assess their ranges These players act in an aggressive manner '
 'because they have learned that most of their opponents play in a '
 'straightforward manner They also know that most of their opponents will not '
 'want to call multiple bets without a premium holding This leads them to bet '
 'whenever they sense weakness which is primarily when their opponents check '
 'Against the average player in small stakes tournaments this is an excellent '
 'strategy to apply These players are usually winners in the small stakes '
 'games although they will get crushed once they move up and face players who '
 'know how to combat them You can beat this type of player in a few ways The '
 'primary way to beat them is to',
 'induce them to try to bluff you Of course if you induce your opponent to try '
 'to bluff you you should not fold whatever you have unless the board runs out '
 'as poorly for you as possible which shouldnt happen too often if you choose '
 'your spots well The most obvious way to induce an opponent to bluff into you '
 'is to check as if you have a weak hand and are going to concede the pot For '
 'example suppose you raise to  big blinds out of your  big blind stack with A '
 'T from middle position and an aggressive players who play too many hands '
 'calls on the button The flop comes A   You make a standard continuation bet '
 'of  big blinds and your opponent calls On most turns you should strongly '
 'consider checking instead of betting for value While this is often referred '
 'to as controlling the pot you are actually inducing a bluff against this '
 'type of player because you should expect him to fold most of his marginal '
 'hands if you bet However he will usually bet if you check By checking you '
 'get him to put much more money in the pot compared to when you check which '
 'is exactly what you want to happen when you probably have the best hand The '
 'turn is the A    You check and your opponent bets  big blinds into the  big '
 'blind pot This is a scenario where lots of amateur players elect to '
 'checkraise trying to force their opponent to fold all of their draws While '
 'your opponent will probably fold his draws he will also fold all of the '
 'hands that you crush such as     and KJ Instead of checkraising you should '
 'checkcall with the intention of checkcalling all rivers',
 'When you call your opponents turn bet dont look overly happy or act in a '
 'fast manner as if calling is the only option that makes sense That could tip '
 'your opponent off to the fact that you have a strong holding Instead act as '
 'if you have a tough decision with a hand such as JJ or  Remember you want '
 'your opponent to bet again on the river While you will get outdrawn roughly  '
 'of the time when you play your hand in this manner you will find that most '
 'of your aggressive opponents cannot resist the opportunity to try to push '
 'you off your obviously weak hand When you show up with top pair on the river '
 'most of them will be shocked thinking that the only way to play top pair is '
 'to bet it for value and protection on all three streets By checking you will '
 'crush these opponents Notice that in this example there are not too many bad '
 'turn and river cards for you While an  or  would complete the most likely '
 'straight draw the other cards are fairly safe If instead of AT on  you had '
 'AT on  you should be much more inclined to bet for value and protection on '
 'the turn because there are numerous cards that could come that could easily '
 'give your opponent the best hand Always try to think about how the hand will '
 'play out if you take each possible betting line If the board could easily '
 'run out terribly for you you should probably bet for value and protection If '
 'the board will usually run out decently well for your hand and your opponent '
 'will play in an aggressive manner with a wide range if you check you should '
 'check to induce a bluff',
 'While it may seem like checking is the only way to induce a bluff you can '
 'also bet into some of your aggressive opponents and induce a bluff For '
 'example suppose a player who plays too many hands in an aggressive manner '
 'raises to  big blinds out of his  big blind stack from middle positon and '
 'you call from the big blind with   The flop comes J   While going for a '
 'checkraise is a fine play betting into your opponent is also a good option '
 'against this type of player If you checkraise or even checkcall your '
 'opponent will know that you at least have something However especially if '
 'you have an aggressive dynamic with your opponent if you bet into him for '
 'around  big blinds he may think that you are trying to push him off his hand '
 'which he probably knows should not be too strong on this board He may decide '
 'to represent a J or he may simply think you cannot withstand immense '
 'pressure resulting in him either raising the flop or calling the flop and '
 'then taking an aggressive action on the turn So you lead for  big blinds and '
 'your opponent raises to  big blinds At this point you should go into '
 'calldown mode You do not want to let your opponent think that you have a '
 'premium hand by reraising You also dont want him to fold because most of his '
 'range is drawing nearly dead Of course he will outdraw you occasionally when '
 'he improves to a straight but that is a risk you must be willing to take if '
 'you want to maximize your expectation from your premium holding On the turn '
 'you should again checkcall with the intention of checkcalling the river '
 'giving your opponent the maximum number of opportunities to spew off his '
 'chips If',
 'he checks behind on the turn he either has nothing which will not call a '
 'river bet or a marginal made hand If you check the river if he has J he will '
 'probably bet for value and if he has worse than an J he probably wont call '
 'if you bet assuming you have some sort of strong hand that can beat middle '
 'pair So if the turn checks through you should check the river Interestingly '
 'if you check the river and your opponent bets depending on the turn and '
 'river card you may want to only checkcall because you could be beat and most '
 'opponents will assume that you must have a premium hand to checkraise the '
 'river This means that your opponent will probably only call a checkraise on '
 'coordinated boards with overly premium hands most of which you lose to For '
 'example if the board runs out J     you should checkcall If it runs out J   '
 'T A you should usually checkraise Another way you can induce an aggressive '
 'player to bluff is by making a tiny bet into your opponent that looks like a '
 'classic blocking bet A blocking bet is a small bet placed with a marginal '
 'made hand usually on the river to induce your opponent into calling with his '
 'strong hands while making it difficult for him to bluff Using blocking bets '
 'in this manner is almost always a bad idea in todays games because most '
 'players will play well against them However if you know your opponent is an '
 'overly aggressive player who will attack any sign of weakness turning the '
 'concept of a blocking bet on its head is an excellent idea Suppose one of '
 'these players raises to  big blinds out of his  big blind stack from',
 'middle position the Button calls and you call with A  from the big blind The '
 'flop comes A   You check the initial raiser bets  big blinds the Button '
 'folds and you call The turn is the A    Both players check The river is the '
 'A    J This is an excellent spot to make a tiny bet of around  big blinds '
 'into the  big blind pot because your aggressive opponent probably doesnt '
 'have an A because he checked behind on the turn This bet will result in your '
 'opponent calling with any sort of made hand which is an excellent result and '
 'either folding or raising with his absolute junk If he folds he will become '
 'suspicious that you bluffed him perhaps allowing you to get unwarranted '
 'action on future hands If he raises you can happily call because you know '
 'that in his eyes you look as if you have a weak made hand and are trying to '
 'get to a cheap showdown It is important to size your river bet to induce '
 'your opponent into doing what you want him to do If you bet  big blinds on '
 'the river instead of  your opponent will almost never raise as a bluff which '
 'is what you are trying to induce Instead your opponent will call with all of '
 'his reasonably strong made hands and fold everything else A large bet leads '
 'to much worse results for you compared to the tiny bet Always try to '
 'quantify what your opponent will do when facing bets of all sizes then pick '
 'the one that works out best for you The other main way to take advantage of '
 'this type of player is by bluffing them when the board is good for your '
 'range and bad for their range You have to realize that this type of player '
 'plays a wide range of hands meaning they could have anything Even',
 'though they could conceivably connect with many more flops than a tight '
 'player around  of the time this type of player will miss the flop This '
 'should lead you to attack their continuation bets fairly often especially '
 'when you should have a strong range For example suppose one of these players '
 'raises to  big blinds out of his  big blind stack from early position the '
 'Cutoff calls and you call with A J from the big blind It is worth noting '
 'that it is usually wise to call when you are out of position with hands that '
 'play reasonably well after the flop Most amateur players reraise with decent '
 'high card hands like AJ and KQ because they are usually best at the moment '
 'Especially when you are out of position this is usually not a good enough '
 'reason to justify bloating the pot The flop comes    You check the initial '
 'raiser bets  big blinds and the Cutoff folds This is an excellent spot to '
 'checkraise to around  big blinds with a wide range of premium made hands '
 'draws and the occasional bluff Anytime you have the backdoor nut flush draw '
 'which you have with the A you should at least consider bluffing Even if you '
 'didnt have the A you should bluff in this situation from time to time '
 'because it is so easy for you to have a strong hand while at the same time '
 'it is so difficult for your opponent to have a strong hand Even if he has AA '
 'he cannot be thrilled to pile money into the pot because he could be against '
 'a straight set or straight flush draw Whenever you can put your opponent in '
 'a terrible spot with the top of his range especially if your opponent thinks '
 'you are relatively tight and',
 'straightforward you should do it If your opponent happens to call your flop '
 'checkraise you should usually continue betting if the turn is a spade Q J '
 'T    or  By betting you can easily represent that you either had the nuts on '
 'the flop and are still happy with your hand or that you have improved to a '
 'premium hand on the turn You do not need to bet too large on the turn '
 'because if you happened to have the nuts instead of a bluff you would easily '
 'be able to go allin by the river by making a small turn bet Notice if you '
 'had the nuts you would not want to let your opponent off the hook on the '
 'turn by betting too large So bet around  big blinds out of your  big blind '
 'stack into the  big blind pot If your opponent decides to call your turn bet '
 'you will have a tough spot on the river You should tend to bet again only if '
 'you think your opponent will fold most of his range If your opponent is a '
 'calling station someone who rarely folds any sort of made hand you should '
 'not have bluffed in this situation to begin with Always remember to pick '
 'your spots well and only run bluffs when there is a reasonably high '
 'likelihood of success',
 'Those who play too few hands While players who play too few hands come in '
 'numerous varieties you can generally break this category of players down '
 'into those who play too few hands too passively and those who play too few '
 'hands too aggressively',
 'Those who play too few hands too passively This type of player rarely puts a '
 'chip in the pot especially after the flop without what they perceive to be '
 'clearly the best hand You will find that these players are deathly afraid of '
 'losing their entire stack Some of them will even fold superstrong hands such '
 'as AK on  if you apply enough pressure That being said some of these players '
 'will never fold hands they think are strong They assume that since they '
 'rarely enter the pot they have to win almost every hand they play Be sure to '
 'pay attention to your specific opponent and quantify exactly which mistakes '
 'he is making Trying to bluff someone who is unbluffable is a devastating '
 'mistake These players usually do not defend their blinds well especially if '
 'you raise and then make a postflop continuation bet They refuse to continue '
 'after the flop without at least a pair If they checkcall they usually have '
 'top pair or worse They typically make your decisions easy by checkraising '
 'with hands that are better than top pair allowing you to easily fold when '
 'you are beat If you are lucky enough to find one of these players who will '
 'checkcall the flop with middle pair and worse but checkraise with top pair '
 'and better you can fire the turn every time your opponent checkcalls the',
 'flop allowing you to steal the pot whenever your opponent doesnt improve to '
 'trips or two pair Most of these players think that the goal of a poker '
 'tournament is to get in the money locking up a mincash This mindset is the '
 'exact opposite of what you should have While getting in the money is nice '
 'the real goal is to finish in the top three spots winning a large number of '
 'buyins If you mincash in a  person tournament  of the time and lose all of '
 'the rest of them you will lose money in the long run However if you win  of '
 'the time and lose the rest of them you will win a ton of money If you want '
 'to succeed at poker you must embrace the fact that you will experience large '
 'swings to your bankroll There are lots of ways to crush this type of '
 'opponent mostly by taking advantage of the fact that they will fold too '
 'often You will find that most of these players are quick to fold when facing '
 'a preflop raise when they are in the blinds If they happen to call preflop '
 'they will usually fold to a postflop continuation bet If one of these '
 'players is in the big blind and the players between you and the big blind '
 'are not too wild especially if you have a reasonably tight image from middle '
 'or late position you should raise to roughly  big blinds with a wide range '
 'hoping to steal the blinds For example from middle position hands such as A  '
 'K  and   should usually be folded if the players yet to act play reasonably '
 'well However if they are mostly tight and passive you should happily raise '
 'expecting to steal the blinds most of the time If one of your opponents '
 'decides to reraise you should fold',
 'because your hand is certainly crushed by their range From late position '
 'your raising range should be even wider Taken to the extreme if you are on '
 'the button and both players in the blinds are overly tight and passive you '
 'can raise with any two cards In general though from any position you should '
 'not fret about folding the absolute worst hands such as   and  It is good '
 'for your image to show your opponents that you can fold from the button from '
 'time to time People usually dont mind if you steal a decent amount but if '
 'you steal every single time they will start to become aware of your strategy '
 'If you raise with a junky hand and one of the tight passive players calls '
 'you should almost always make a continuation bet of around  of the size of '
 'the pot which will be around  or  big blinds This will give you an excellent '
 'price on your bluff while still getting your opponent to fold almost every '
 'time he fails to improve on the flop If your opponent calls your flop bet '
 'unless you have a strong hand you should tend to give up Against the rare '
 'player who plays too few hands too passively but is a bit sticky after the '
 'flop meaning he rarely folds to continuation bets you should probably fire a '
 'second barrel on the turn especially when scary cards arrive If you raise '
 'preflop and get multiple callers you should usually play in a '
 'straightforward manner betting when you have something decent and getting '
 'out of the way when you miss Since most of these players really want to get '
 'in the money you should look to exploit',
 'them late in the tournament whenever you are approaching a payout jump Do '
 'not be afraid to reraise them with a decently wide range especially when '
 'they make a raise from late position where they could conceivably be '
 'stealing For example suppose you are almost in the money and one of these '
 'players raises to  big blinds out of his  big blind stack from the button '
 'You are in the small blind with K  This is an excellent spot to at least '
 'consider reraising to around  big blinds If your opponent  to perhaps  big '
 'blinds or allin you can easily fold because you are certainly in awful shape '
 'If he calls you can bet  big blinds on the flop and usually steal the pot Of '
 'course if your opponent continues to the turn you should give up unless you '
 'have an overly strong holding because in order for your opponent to call '
 'your flop bet he should have a strong hand that he is willing to put his '
 'stack in with That being said do not get too wild against this type of '
 'player Especially when there is a ton of money on the line some of these '
 'players will only enter the pot with hands that they do not plan on folding '
 'to any amount of aggression These players may be so tight that they will not '
 'even consider stealing the blinds from late position Instead they patiently '
 'wait for AA KK QQ JJ TT  AK or AQ and then try to get their stack in You '
 'crush players who play this tight by folding This may sound counterintuitive '
 'but every time you do not give these players action when they have a premium '
 'hand you save a ton of money Coupled with stealing their blinds relentlessly '
 'they will slowly',
 'get ground down losing roughly  big blinds per orbit That  big blinds per '
 'orbit number comes from the fact that these players will play around one in  '
 'hands that they are dealt If you never give them action without an equally '
 'premium hand they will win the blinds once every  on average while '
 'forfeiting their blinds once every nine hands For example at  it costs  to '
 'play each orbit which works out to on average  chips per hand If a tight '
 'player successfully steals  once every  hands he will steal  chips per steal '
 'attempt on average This will result in him losing  chips per hand or  chips '
 'per orbit Using this strategy if he has a reasonable stack of  chips he will '
 'lose  of his stack in only  hands As the blinds continue to increase his '
 'stack will diminish even faster This is why most of these players are '
 'decently good at getting in the money before the blinds get too high but '
 'terrible at winning the tournament once the blinds get big which in turn '
 'makes them terrible at winning money in poker tournaments While it is not '
 'too costly to only play premium hands when the blinds are small compared to '
 'your stack as the blinds increase losing  big blinds per orbit is a disaster '
 'This is why you see lots of excellent players implementing a snug strategy '
 'early in the tournament but an almost maniacal strategy once the blinds get '
 'high When the pre flop pots become significant you simply must fight for '
 'them especially if your opponents will let you run them over If you dont you '
 'are certain to lose money in',
 'the long run Of course the math is not quite that simple because these '
 'players will occasionally get action whenever their opponents play poorly by '
 'getting involved with vastly inferior hands Notice they will effectively '
 'break even in situations where two players both have premium hands because '
 'all players will get the same amount of premium hands in the long run If you '
 'know a guy is only entering the pot with premium hands especially once the '
 'stacks get short refuse to give him action unless you also have a premium '
 'hand You dont have to enter the pot simply because your hand is normally '
 'playable against the average opponent For example suppose a player who plays '
 'too few hands too passively raises to  big blinds out of his  big blind '
 'stack from second position You have AQ in middle position You should easily '
 'fold While this may sound incredibly tight to some readers you must realize '
 'that AQ is in marginal shape at best against this players likely strong '
 'raising range In fact you should even consider folding decent pairs such as  '
 'in this situation Not only do you have to worry about the initial raiser but '
 'you also have to take into account the players yet to act who will each pick '
 'up a premium hand around  of the time Even though hands such as AQ and  are '
 'normally quite playable they could easily be crushed by this players early '
 'position raising range Therefore you dont want to reraise and calling will '
 'lead to situations where you are frequently dominated postflop You should '
 'fold and wait for a better spot',
 'If you fail to pay off the tight passive players you will slowly grind them '
 'down in the long run Do not impatiently donate your stack to them',
 'Those who play too few hands too aggressively This is the second most common '
 'player type after those who play too many hands too passively that you will '
 'encounter in small stakes poker tournaments These players have usually '
 'studied a few of the older poker books that say that tight is right These '
 'older poker books suggest waiting around for a strong hand before applying '
 'extreme pressure hoping to either win the pot with no contest which is not '
 'actually a good result when you have best hand you want to get value or get '
 'allin with what should be the best hand but often isnt when a ton of money '
 'goes into the pot Clearly these players have huge holes in their games that '
 'you can exploit These players tend to vastly overplay marginal made hands '
 'such as top pair and overpairs When they make a hand they think is strong '
 'they want to pile their stack into the pot as fast as possible before the '
 'board gets too scary It is not uncommon to see these players raise to  big '
 'blinds out of their  big blind stack with a hand such as AQ get one caller '
 'from the blinds and flop  They then continuation bet  big blinds and face a '
 'checkraise to  big blinds Instead of considering their opponents '
 'checkraising range they hastily either reraise small to  big blinds with the '
 'intention',
 'of getting allin on the turn or simply push allin on the flop They are '
 'usually shocked when their opponent shows them either a set or  Instead of '
 'taking time to realize that they played their hand poorly they curse the '
 'poker gods for their bad luck By blasting their stacks in whenever they have '
 'a strong hand they give their opponents huge implied odds They are simply '
 'not capable of folding strong hands that are fairly difficult to make '
 'Obviously if you are crushed by your opponents range which should be quite '
 'strong if they recognize you are a tight aggressive player you should fold '
 'all but your absolute best hands when a lot of money goes into the pot You '
 'can easily beat this type of player by playing against them primarily with '
 'overly premium hands such as KK and AK and hands that have huge implied odds '
 'such as  A  and   You want to play the premium hands because they have even '
 'a tight range crushed and you want to play the implied odds hands because '
 'you frequently get paid off whenever you improve to a strong postflop hand '
 'Of course if the stacks are shallow the implied odds hands lose a lot of '
 'value because you will not be able to win too much even when you hit You '
 'want to make a point to avoid hands that are easily dominated against this '
 'type of opponent A  and K T are particularly bad because it is relatively '
 'easy to make a strong but dominated hand such as with KT on  The last thing '
 'you want to do is play hands that frequently either lose large pots or win '
 'small ones When facing a raise from a tight aggressive player unless your '
 'hand is almost certainly ahead or has a ton of postflop potential simply '
 'fold and wait for a better spot',
 'If you happen to find yourself in a situation where you have a decently '
 'strong but not amazing postflop hand make a point to not lose your entire '
 'stack when your tight aggressive opponent clearly wants to put a lot of '
 'chips in the pot For example suppose a player who plays too many hands too '
 'aggressively raises to  at  from middle positon out of his  stack You decide '
 'to call on the button with K Q The blinds fold It is worth noting that you '
 'should almost never reraise with this hand before the flop against this type '
 'of player The flop comes K   Your opponent bets  and you call Folding would '
 'be too tight as you could easily be against numerous worse hands such as TT '
 'and AQ The turn is the K    Your opponent bets  At this point you should be '
 'concerned that you could have the worst hand While you could make a case for '
 'folding against the tightest players who only continue betting on the turn '
 'with top pair top kicker and better made hands you should usually call one '
 'more time to see what develops on the river It is mandatory that you '
 'formulate a plan for the river before you call on the turn If your opponent '
 'bets a third time you should probably fold giving him credit for KJ or '
 'better Of course you beat KJ but you lose to everything else Sometimes your '
 'opponent will accidently turn a worse made hand into a bluff Dont let that '
 'bother you Most of the time when you will be crushed If your opponent checks '
 'on the river you should probably check behind unless you are',
 'confident your opponent would bet with AK and better meaning his checking '
 'range consist entirely of hands that you beat So the river is the K     Your '
 'opponent bets  Sticking with the plan you should fold While you may have the '
 'best hand some small percentage of the time you are almost certainly beat '
 'Remember a penny saved is a penny earned Be aware that you should almost '
 'never make this fold versus a loose player who is prone to betting with a '
 'much wider range either for value or as a bluff You should also not fold '
 'versus players who vastly overvalue strong preflop hands that failed to '
 'improve after the flop such as JJ or AQ on the K     board Always take your '
 'opponents tendencies into consideration Since these players tend to be a bit '
 'too tight before the flop you can slowly grind them down by stealing their '
 'blinds whenever you find an opportunity Do not be afraid to attack their '
 'blinds even from early or middle position especially if the players between '
 'you and the blinds are relatively tight Suppose everyone folds to you in the '
 'cutoff and you look down at   The effective stack size is  big blinds The '
 'Button Small Blind and Big Blind are all players who play too few hands You '
 'should strongly consider raising to around  big blinds If you get reraised '
 'you should fold If one player calls you should almost always make a  big '
 'blind continuation bet on the flop If multiple players call you should '
 'usually play in a straightforward manner after the flop Remember your goal '
 'is to steal the',
 'blinds When you face too much resistance dont be afraid to get out of the '
 'way Of course if the Button Small Blind and Big Blind dont like to fold '
 'before the flop you should easily fold your awful  Similarly to how you '
 'should combat tight passive opponents and loose passive opponents when a '
 'tight aggressive player decides to reraise you before the flop or apply '
 'significant pressure after the flop unless you are getting huge implied odds '
 'with a hand that has a decent chance to improve you should fold Remember you '
 'win a huge amount of equity by staying out of trouble when your opponents '
 'range has you crushed For example you raise from the hijack seat to  big '
 'blinds out of your  big blind stack with A J The Button a tight player who '
 'plays his strong hands too aggressively decides to reraise to  big blinds '
 'This is situation where you should make an easy fold You are usually '
 'dominated and when you arent you have to play a tricky hand out of position '
 'that will fail to connect with the flop  of the time While going allin would '
 'be an option against a loose aggressive player against a tight player it is '
 'not a good idea because your opponent will play perfectly calling with his '
 'hands that beat you and folding those that dont While the reraiser in this '
 'example could easily exploit you by reraising with a much wider range you '
 'can rest assured that most of these players will rarely get out of line They '
 'have been taught to reraise with their strong hands and fold everything else '
 'Those are their rules and they are sticking to them Of course if you notice '
 'that your',
 'opponent is constantly reraising you despite your assumption that he should '
 'be playing a snug range you may need to reassess your read and start '
 'fighting back',
 'Those who play roughly the correct amount of hands in an intelligent manner '
 'While these players tend to quickly move up from the small stakes games to '
 'larger buyin games where they can win more money all good players must start '
 'somewhere These players tend to be on the tighter side while being capable '
 'of running welltimed postflop bluffs and getting away from hands that are '
 'reasonably strong but obviously crushed One sign of a strong player is that '
 'they usually win a lot of small pots especially on the turn and the river '
 'without a showdown while at the same time rarely playing a large pot without '
 'a premium holding One of the main ways to beat this type of player is by '
 'applying significant pressure in intelligent spots where your range should '
 'be stronger than your opponents For example suppose one of these players '
 'raises from early position and you call on the button If the flop comes    '
 'and your opponent bets this is an excellent spot to raise with an overly '
 'wide range because the board should be much better for your range than your '
 'opponents',
 'Especially in the small stakes games many of these players are well versed '
 'in the idea of betting for value with a reasonably wide value range with the '
 'intention of folding if raised Use their dependence on this play against '
 'them Suppose one of these players raises from middle position and you call '
 'in the big blind with   The flop comes A   You check your opponent bets and '
 'you call The turn is the A   T You check and your opponent bets again Seeing '
 'how you almost certainly have the worst hand at the moment calling is not a '
 'good idea However you could checkraise as a semibluff assuming the stacks '
 'are deep enough that you have some fold equity If you know that your '
 'opponent would value bet any A on the turn with the intention of folding if '
 'he gets raised you should checkraise with a wide range of hands that are not '
 'quite good enough to continue checkcalling with Another way to exploit these '
 'players is by folding when it is clear they want to put a lot of money in '
 'the pot Assuming you know that your specific opponent rarely attempts '
 'somewhat wild flop and turn checkraises if he checkraises you do not be '
 'afraid to make a big fold Of course if your opponent is somewhat wild after '
 'the flop you should be a bit more prone to see a showdown While trying to '
 'exploit every player you encounter is a good idea it is usually a good idea '
 'to avoid strong players and focus your attention on crushing the weak '
 'players who are easily exploitable Remember you win money at poker because '
 'your opponents make mistakes If your opponents do not make many mistakes you '
 'will not win much of their money',
 'Assuming you are one of these strong players which you either currently are '
 'or are working to become you must be keenly aware of how your opponents view '
 'you Remember each specific opponent will have his own perception about you '
 'Perhaps you won a big pot with no showdown against a player who may now '
 'think you are capable of bluffing Even though you may have won the pot with '
 'a legitimately strong hand he will be suspicious Maybe another guy at the '
 'same table lost a sizable pot to you when you called his bluff with middle '
 'pair He may think you are a calling station Perhaps you have folded your big '
 'blind to the same players preflop raise a few orbits in a row because you '
 'had trashy cards He may think you are overly tight in the blinds It is '
 'important to realize that the way your opponents perceive you is based on '
 'what they see not what you see You have to look at the world from your '
 'opponents point of view You will find that this is initially a difficult '
 'thing to do but if you constantly practice you will get better at it over '
 'time If your opponent expects you to be tight you should bluff more often If '
 'you have played very few hands recently feel free to get well out of line '
 'and play a marginal hand as if it is the nuts Suppose you have been somewhat '
 'tight recently and decide to raise from middle position with  to  big blinds '
 'out of your  big blind stack A loose aggressive player who loves to reraise '
 'reraises you to  big blinds from the button This is an excellent spot to '
 'reraise to around  big blinds It will put the Button in a difficult spot '
 'with most of his nonpremium range because it looks as if you are willing to '
 'get your entire stack in Of course if the Button decides to put his stack in '
 'despite your aggression you should get out of the way You must accept that',
 'sometimes your bluffs will fail even if you have been playing a tight '
 'strategy Another time you can get well out of line is when in the past '
 'against a specific player you have had premium holdings most of the time If '
 'a specific player thinks that you only play strong hands unless he is a '
 'calling station he will make big folds to you on the turn and river when you '
 'take a line that he only thinks you would take with a strong hand If your '
 'opponent thinks you are crazy you should tend to value bet with a much wider '
 'range than normal especially if your opponent will refuse to fold A high or '
 'better regardless of the board When you have a reasonable idea of how you '
 'think your opponents expects you to play it is wise to play your premium '
 'hands as your opponent thinks you would play your bluffs and your bluffs as '
 'he thinks you would play your premium hands',
 'Pay attention I cannot make it clearer that you simply must pay attention to '
 'what your opponents are doing if you want to succeed at poker You should '
 'actively quantify the mistakes your opponents are making and what you can do '
 'to exploit those mistakes If you find yourself thinking My opponent is bad '
 'then you arent quantifying your opponents weaknesses well Instead you should '
 'think something along the lines of My opponent calls with a wide range '
 'preflop and on the flop and then plays much too tightly on the turn This '
 'means I should bet almost every time on the turn when my opponent calls my '
 'preflop raise and my flop continuation bet Or perhaps My opponent in the big '
 'blind folds his big blind to  big blind raises almost every time but '
 'frequently calls when I raise to  big blinds I should raise to  big blinds '
 'because that will result in me stealing the blinds much more often By '
 'quantifying what you can do to succeed against each player you will be '
 'better able to develop a game plan that will allow you to exploit your '
 'opponents as much as possible It is important to realize that as you improve '
 'your opponents will have fewer and fewer flaws in their game If you do not '
 'work hard at developing your observation skills in the small stakes games '
 'you will not be adequately prepared when you move up I realize that giving '
 'your full attention to poker while at the table is not easy I suggest',
 'that you make a game out of trying to put each player on a range of hands '
 'and seeing if you are right when the cards sporadically get turned faceup '
 'This will keep you focused on the game and improve your handreading '
 'abilities at the same time Another tip is to do something at the start of '
 'every hand that signifies to you that you need to focus Some players snap a '
 'rubber band around their wrists and others move a chip from the top of one '
 'stack to the top of another stack Whatever you do do not be lulled into a '
 'trance by the dealers shuffling or the constant sound of chips banging '
 'together I also suggest that you dont shuffle your poker chips whether or '
 'not you are involved in a pot While this action may seem innocuous enough '
 'you will find that it is purely a distraction If you are distracted you will '
 'not focus as well as possible If you find yourself not paying attention '
 'while you are playing gently scold yourself and resolve to make the most of '
 'your time at the poker table Do not be too hard on yourself though It is '
 'incredibly easy to lose focus If you improve a little bit each time you play '
 'given time you will be excellent',
 'Specific tendencies you will encounter in small stakes tournaments While all '
 'players are different you will likely discover that there are a few key '
 'leaks that small stakes players have in addition to the ones that have been '
 'previously discussed which keep them from succeeding In this section I will '
 'outline some of these devastating traits that your opponents will display on '
 'a regular basis Remember you will only discover these traits if you are '
 'actively paying attention If you are constantly playing on your phone or '
 'watching TV you will miss out on this equity Suppose you see that a player '
 'raises with a wide range of hands before the flop but folds when he is '
 'reraised unless he has a premium hand Against this type of player you should '
 'frequently reraise forcing him to fold most of his range For example if '
 'someone with this tendency raises from middle position and you are in late '
 'position do not be afraid to reraise to around three times your opponents '
 'initial raise This will apply a lot of pressure and frequently result in you '
 'winning the pot without seeing a flop If your opponent calls your reraise '
 'you should probably make a postflop continuation bet that is roughly the '
 'size of your preflop reraise on most',
 'boards If your opponent is still in the pot at that point you should assume '
 'he has a decently strong hand You should get out of the way unless you also '
 'have a strong hand As long as you use this play sporadically it will remain '
 'hugely profitable Suppose you see that a player raises with a reasonable '
 'range before the flop and then continuation bets on the flop  of the time '
 'When he gets raised or checkraised he only continues in the pot if he has '
 'top pair or better This is an excellent player to raise or checkraise on the '
 'flop with a wide range especially on boards that should not be good for the '
 'preflop raisers range For example suppose someone with this tendency raises '
 'from middle position and you call on the button Pretty much no matter what '
 'the flop comes you should at least consider raising if your opponent '
 'continuation bets You could also call your opponents continuation bet then '
 'bet the turn if he checks to you or raise his turn bet if he fires again '
 'Since your opponents range is wide if he doesnt defend well against raises '
 'he will frequently concede the pot to you Suppose you know your opponent '
 'raises to  big blinds before the flop with exactly JJ and TT You know that '
 'this player raises to  big blinds with every other hand in his raising range '
 'You also know that he will never fold JJ and TT preflop to any amount of '
 'aggression as long as you do not go allin If you reraise small he will '
 'usually reraise allin not wanting to get outdrawn by what he thinks is your '
 'obvious AK Since your opponents hand is effectively face up when he raises '
 'to  big blinds you',
 'should fold all of your trash that is drawing thin call with your hands that '
 'have huge implied odds as well as with your over cards and reraise with '
 'premium pairs JJ and better If you know more about this opponents postflop '
 'tendencies you should consider calling with a wide range of hands with the '
 'intention of stealing the pot when an over card comes if you know your '
 'opponent will give you credit for having him beat If your opponent will '
 'never fold regardless of the board because he views JJ and TT as super '
 'premium hands you should only play hands that have your opponents narrow '
 'range crushed or hands that have the proper equity or implied odds to '
 'continue These examples should get you started thinking about all of the '
 'possible ways to exploit your opponents tendencies once you become aware of '
 'them If you make a point to figure out when and where your opponents are '
 'making errors if you are willing to get out of your comfort zone you will '
 'succeed in the long run',
 'Conclusion After reading this book you should be wellequipped to tackle the '
 'small stakes tournaments As long as you remain mindful while at the table '
 'and actively quantify your opponents tendencies you will be on the road to '
 'beating the small stakes and moving up to the middle stakes I have a wealth '

 'well in most situations you should adjust them to take your specific '

 'charts show which hands to play when everyone folds to you The Facing RFI '
 'charts show how to play when someone raises before you The RFI vs  charts '
 'show how to play when you RFI and then someone yet to act  The charts '

 'using a  big blind initial raise size a  size that is  times the opponents '
 'raise and a  size that is  times the opponents  From out of position use a  '
 'big blind initial raise size a  size that is  times the opponents raise and '
 'a  size that is  times the opponents  These charts are an excellent default '
