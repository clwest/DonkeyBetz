[Document(page_content="in this video i'll be outlining an efficient and comprehensive method to study solver solutions which may be particularly helpful for those that are new to solvers and don't know where to begin to start with i should note that when reviewing the sim we never want to focus solely on how our specific hand is being played because when we analyze a hand this way we lose the context of what is driving the overall strategies right the same hand may be played in completely different ways depending on the context such as the prior action the positions of the players and the spr so instead to develop a deeper understanding of range construction and counter strategies we need to review how the entire range is being played for both hero and villain on each street now obviously analyzing each individual combination in both players ranges is not really feasible so i have three practical tips for you to focus on at each decision point to help maximize your study efficiency the first tip is to focus on the tendency of the overall range and the predominant bet sizes being used and the reason why we do this is to help train our intuition on how board textures interact with ranges and how that in turn affects strategies so in this case we have a button versus big blind single raised pot in a six max game and we see that on this ace king 10 rainbow board the solver is playing quite aggressively in the button shoes on the flop betting almost 75 of the time including by using the large full pot sizing with high frequency obviously this is a board that's going to favor the pre-flop aggressor who has a huge nut advantage at the top of the range with all the straights sets two pairs and strongest top pairs that being said the big blind has an advantage in this middle part of the range with moderate equity which warrants some amount of checking the second tip is to focus on where the cutoff points exist between different actions between calling and folding checking and value betting realizing and bluffing etc etc and the reason why we do this is because once we know where the cutoff points are we will have a general sense of how hands on either side of the threshold should be played without having to analyze them individually so for example in this case when the big blind is facing a half pot c bet we see a pretty distinct cutoff point between calling and folding at third pair and if we isolate these combos we see that 100 of these hands with either a gut shot or a backdoor flush draw are calling and all other 10x combos without this additional incremental equity are pure folds and the final tip when reviewing a sim is to focus on where the bluffs are coming from right we never want to show up in any spot where our opponent knows that we have zero bluffs because we'll lose a ton of ev on our value bets so unless you're playing a total scrub you should always have some bluffs in every spot and we can look to the solver for cues on finding the best bluffing candidates so for example on this potential turn barrel spot for the button if we isolate the unmade hands we see that the solver is heavily prioritizing bluffing withdraws which makes intuitive sense since these hands have the potential to suck out on the river in fact if we group all of the draws together we see that the ev regret for betting three quarters pot is less than one percent which means that if you wanted to simplify your strategy and bet 100 of all of these unmade hands the maximum amount you would lose in expectation against a gto opponent is less than 1 10 of a big blind similarly if you decided to just check and give up with all of your unmade hands without a draw the ev regret is zero this means that you can simply check all of the combos within this group without having to examine each one individually to try to figure out if any of them are bluffing some small percentage of the time so hopefully these three tips can help you guys get more out of your solver study and this method of analyzing sims can even be used with other solvers it's just 10 times more efficient when using gto check so that's the video for today thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced", metadata={'source': 'Ab5P4aQEarI', 'title': 'How to Review Solver Sims  | GTOx Fundamentals', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 12591, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ab5P4aQEarI/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2021-01-28 00:00:00', 'length': 263, 'author': 'Finding Equilibrium'})]
[Document(page_content="in this video i'll be going over a method to simplify learning and implementing gto strategies one of the most common ways people learn poker is through pattern recognition for example when we see a flop with all high cards we understand through experience that the pre-flop aggressor has an advantage on this board and should generally be doing a lot of seabedding however since there are almost an infinite number of different situations that exist in poker finding spots where all of the exact same variables repeat themselves as highly unlikely which makes pattern recognition difficult so to address this problem we can take a page from the world of artificial intelligence by using a technique known as bucketing bucketing is used by ai to group together hands of similar strength thereby reducing the number of variables that need to be contended with and simplifying the game for example on this king 73 two-tone board ace king of diamonds and ace-king of hearts are strategically identical as they have the exact same showdown strength and neither has a backdoor flush draw so attempting to individually reason about each of these combos separately doesn't add any value in reality most players likely bucket hands without even realizing it right when playing in real time most players primarily think in terms of how their category of hands should be playing instead of how their specific combo should be playing for example instead of thinking about how ace king of spades should be playing on this board most players will think about how their top pairs or top pairs with strong kicker should be played however unlike computers which can easily implement using thousands of buckets humans can manage far less which creates a dilemma since there's a trade-off between simplifying strategy by utilizing fewer buckets and maximizing ev so in practice the goal for each player as he progresses in his experience and learning should be to make his analysis more and more sophisticated and granular by gradually increasing the number of buckets he uses which in turn will increase the eb of his plays so let's take a look at an example to see how bucketing works in practice in this hand the lojack opened in a 6 max cash game in the small blind called the flop is king 10 7 rainbow and the small blind needs to decide whether he should bet or check in this case most experienced players would likely quickly check on this board without much thon in reality what these players are doing is that they're actually bucketing 100 of their hands together to be played the same way because they recognize the fact that they're out of position and at a significant range disadvantage and we can confirm that this highly abstracted simplified strategy is optimal by checking the range eb regret value which tells us how much the small blind would lose in expectation against the gto opponent if it chose to check 100 of its hands in its range which in this case is zero however when we get to the low jacks decision we see that the strategy is much more mixed and complex how should a relative novice constructive sea betting strategy here when memorizing all of these different frequencies is not possible well we can greatly simplify our strategy through the use of bucketing but we want to do it in a rational and not in an arbitrary way by focusing on the most important concept in all poker ev for example let's start by creating a bucket for our strongest hands first when we bucket together all of our sets we see that the eevee regret for betting a number of different sizings is relatively low this means that if we decide to bet full pot with 100 of our sets in this spot the maximum amount of ev we would lose compared to the gto solution is 0.9 percent of the pot or about four or one hundredths of one big blind or if we chose to bet quarter pot with one hundred percent of our sets the maximum amount of eevee we'd lose is zero big blinds but instead of trying to develop a unique strategy for our sets and for each of the other hand classes in our range which would still be quite complex what if we wanted to simplify things further well let's try to add our two pairs to this bucket now we see that if we bet quarter pot with percent of our sets and two pair combos the maximum amount of eevee would lose is point two percent the pot or less than one one hundredths of a big blind now let's add in over pairs and the eevee regret for betting all of these combos quarter pot remains the same but what happens when we add in top pairs well now we see that the eevee regret for all actions has jumped significantly to over five percent so in this case we've probably simplified the strategy too far and our initial bucket of strongest hands should probably just consist of sets two pairs and over pairs all of which we'll just bet quarter pot but we can't stop here because we need to construct a strategy for the remainder of our range so let's reset the filters and create a bucket for our next tier of hands starting with top pair and we'll keep adding classes until we reach the point where further bucketing results in a significant ev loss which in this case is at the weakest pairs so we see that when we create a bucket consisting of top pairs under pairs second pairs and third pairs and simply decide to check all the combos within this bucket we only lose point nine percent of the pot compared to the gto solution which makes intuitive sense since one of the primary incentives for middle strength hands is to realize without growing a huge pot and finally let's bucket the weakest hands in our range together and we see that betting quarter pot with all of these combos results in zero ev loss which also makes sense as these hands have limited showdown value and therefore should benefit significantly by getting the opponent to fold so instead of trying to reconstruct our entire range combo by combo we see that through the use of bucketing we're able to greatly simplify our strategy by creating three wide classes that can be played in the same way without significant ev loss now some of you gto wizards that are watching at this point are likely thinking to yourself that actually this type of simplified strategy is exploitable and doesn't maximize ev since it's overly polarized and affords poor coverage on various runouts and you would be right but everyone needs to start somewhere and we don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good additionally once a novice player is able to build a solid foundational understanding of equity distributions by using just a handful of buckets in this way he can then advance towards expanding the number of buckets he uses in an incremental manner so for example if we wanted to add a bit more refinement to our strategy and check some strong hands to protect the middle part of our range we can start by deciding to check some of our sets that are blocking the greatest proportion of our opponent's calling range in this case pocket tens and we see that although checking all of our sets would lead to a major ev loss if we decided to only check some of our tens the ev loss is relatively small we could also try to add a bit more complexity into our strategy by betting some of our top pairs right we could decide to bet with some or all of our top pairs with the strongest kickers which we see results in low eb regret and then decide to check all of our top pairs with weaker kickers that have a high ev regret for betting but a low ev regret for checking we can also mix some of our middling hands into our bedding range by choosing to bet some of these combos with a backdoor flush draw which only results in 0.1 percent of bb regret and then just check all of these combos without a backdoor flush draw which generally prefer not to bet additionally we can differentiate between pocket pairs and non-pocket pairs right when we click on our middling pairs we see that pocket eights and nines are mostly checking whereas 7x although weaker in rank is actually playing much more aggressively likely because non-pocket pairs have more outs to improve on turns and rivers by using a bit of a merged strategy in this way and adding some mid-strength hands into our betting range we gain a bit of ev through protection and also by having better coverage on various runouts and finally instead of simply betting all of our unmade hands we could refine our strategy a bit by mixing them across the board right we see that the ev regrets for betting small and checking are relatively insignificant so we could for example use a blanket thirty percent check seventy percent bet mix with all of our unmade hands which although would not be replicating gto perfectly which is impossible it would ensure that we have sufficient draws and bluffs throughout different branches of our game tree so as we can see bucketing is an essential tool which can be used to simplify and tame the impossible complexities of gto strategies and this type of bucketing system is scalable since the number of buckets each player chooses can be modulated according to each player's experience level so that is the video for today thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced", metadata={'source': 'TqL7Z5hrbIc',

[Document(page_content="in the last video posted on this channel we reviewed a high stakes hand between limitless and stefan11222 which included a lot of discussion of blockers and unblockers some of you have had questions about these concepts so in this gto check fundamentals video we're going to step back to define what blockers and unblockers are and when they should and should not be used so let's start by defining what a blocker is given that there are 52 unique cards in the deck when we're holding a particular card it makes it impossible for our opponent to also hold that same card which in turn prevents or blocks our opponent from making certain hands and this is why the phrase card removal is often used in the context of blockers because when we hold a particular card it removes certain combinations from our opponent's range so for example i recently played a six max test hand where i raised on the cutoff with six of diamonds six of clubs the button three bed tonight called in this case although typically the button's three betting range should look something like this since i was holding a six of clubs it was impossible for him to hold any of these suited combos or pocket 6 combos so in other words the cards in my hand were blocking my opponent from holding these combos which in turn changed the probability distribution of his range in unblocker is essentially the reverse of a blocker where when we're holding two specific cards we do not block other combinations in our opponent's range that do not contain our cards so in this case my pocket sixes were unblocking all the combinations in my opponent's range that did not contain a six of clubs or six of diamonds such as ace ten of clubs or pocket kings or jack 10 suited etc etc so now that we've explained what blockers and unblockers are why are they important well all of the rational decisions we make in poker are entirely dependent upon the probability of our opponent holding or making certain hands and so when we possess cards that prevent our opponent from holding or making certain hands it shifts these probabilities and therefore our strategies should also change as a result we should also note that blockers and unblockers can be positive or negative factors depending on whether the relevant card removal effects strengthen or weaken our opponent's range generally blockers and unblockers have the most significance in spots where we need to rationally differentiate between similarly situated hands that are near a point of indifference a point of indifference exists when a group of similar hands is on the border line between two or more actions examples include a hand with low equity that's near the borderline of giving up or bluffing a medium strength hand that's near the borderline between realizing and thin value betting or strong hand that's near the borderline between value betting and slow playing in these situations usually due to how the player's ranges match up we often will not be able to play all of the combos within our class the same way with a pure strategy or else we would be unbalanced and end up losing some ev so to maximize our ev we need to mix the hands in our class between two or more actions and the most logical way to determine this mix in many instances is by availing to blockers and unblockers so let's use this hand as an example to explain further i ended up checking the flop the button c bet i called and the turn was a five of clubs and i checked again now for the sake of discussion let's assume that the button had a random king high and he needed to decide whether he should bear all well if we isolate his king high hands we see that the strategy is mixed although the button has a significant advantage in over pairs this board is not great for him as the cutoff actually has a significant advantage in sets the upshot of this is that the button should not be betting all of his range or else he would be way over bluffing but he still needs some bluffs to support his value and protection bets so how should the button determine which king high hands should barrel and which should check back while on the flop and turn one of the primary drivers of bluffing will be draws and we see that the solve is essentially bluffing all of the king high combos with a straight draw but these draws only comprise a handful of combos so the button will need to find some bluffs elsewhere however when we isolate the king high combos without a draw we see that the ev regret for each available action is greater than one percent meaning that if the button decided to just arbitrarily choose one of these actions over the others or randomly mix between these actions he could potentially lose a significant amount of ev so how should the button decide which king highs he should bet so that he has adequate bluffs and which king highs he should check so he isn't over bluffing well one factor that the solver will often use to differentiate between similar potential bluffing candidates is unblockers that is in a bluffing scenario the solver will often play more aggressively with a hand when that hand does not block the weaker combinations in the opponent's range that are more likely to fold when facing a bet and for those that are newer to the concept of unblockers the gto check solver provides this scatter chart that can be used to help point us in the direction of which hands have better unblocking properties compared to others the x-axis of this chart plots each hand in the button's filtered class in this case king-high combos with no draws based on the hand's unblocker score which is a metric designed to approximate unblocker effects for each such hand the unblocker score simply measures the aggregate percentage of ev that such hand does not block from hands and villains range with lower equity with a floor of 35 percent so in this case since these king i hands have less than 35 percent equity the unblocker scores measuring the aggregate percentage of ev from the cutoffs range with less than 35 percent equity that each of the buttons king high hands does not block in contrast for a hand like third pair which has around 50 equity the unblocker score measures the percentage of ev from the cutoffs range with less than 50 equity that such hand does not block so in a potential bluffing scenario such as this one all other things being equal the button wants a higher unblocker score because it means that his hand removes a lower percentage of the cutoff's weaker combos that are likely to fold if we isolate the buttons combos with the highest unblocker scores we see that although the strategy is still mixed it's betting over 75 percent of the time and the eb regret for betting three quarters pot or full pot is now less than 0.5 percent this means that if the button wanted to simplify its strategy and blanket bluff all of these combos with these sizings the most he would lose an expectation against a gto opponent would be point four percent of the pot or around point one big blinds now let's instead brush the buttons king eye hands with lower unblocker scores and we see that the betting percentage has dropped down by more than half to around 30 percent so what is the difference between these two groups well it seems quite clear that the hands with the higher unblocker scores tend to contain a club and the hands with the lower unblocker scores tend to not contain a club and in fact if we filter out clubs from the hands with the lower unblocker scores we see that the eb regret for simply checking 100 of these combos is now zero so why is this well the most prevalent weaker hands in the cutoffs range that would have likely floated a flop bet were combos with two overs and a backdoor flush draw and since there were no clubs on the flop the cutoff should have been much more likely to float the flop with hands that contain two spades diamonds or hearts so on the turn much of the weaker portion of the cutoff's range will consist of suited combos containing spades diamonds or hearts that fail to improve right when we filter for the cutoff's weaker hands and then filter by suit we see that the aggregate weight for combos with a spade heart or diamond are around 0.5 but the aggregate weight for these combos with a club is four times less as a result when the button is holding a spade diamond or heart it decreases the probability that the cut off is holding one of these weak hands by a much larger degree compared to if the button was holding a club so in other words holding a club unblocks a greater portion of the kadas folding range compared to the other suits and therefore among this class of hands mathematically speaking the button has a greater probability of getting a fold if he holds a club versus a heart spade or diamond so that was an example of using unblockers in the context of a bluff what about blockers well let's navigate to the cutoff's turn decision facing a three-quarter pot barrel here we see that essentially all combos that are third pair or better are defending and most straight draws are also calling additionally there is also a small proportion of ace highs without a draw that are defending as well so let's examine which ace highs are calling and which ace highs are folding and try to figure out how this mix is determined when we brush the ace high combos with lower unblocker scores we see that although most of these combos are folding one combo stands out in particular which is the ace jack of clubs that's actually calling with very high frequency so why is ace jack of clubs calling most of the time but the other ace jack suited combos are essentially pure folds even though all of these combos have the exact same showdown value and there are no flush draws available well when we focus just on the ace jack suited combos we see that there's a pretty clear distinction among these hands along the y axis which measures each hand's blocker score for each combo within the selected hand class in this case ace jack suited the blocker score calculates the aggregate percentage of ev that such combo blocks from hands and villains range with higher equity so in this case ace jack of clubs has a higher blocker score compared to ace jack of spades diamonds or hearts when we search the stronger portion of the buttons range which contain either an ace of clubs or jack of clubs we see that the aggregate weight is 1.2 whereas the aggregate weight for the other asex or jack x combos are slightly less and to understand why this is we need to retrace the buttons actions back to the flop which is an exercise that you'll often need to do when trying to understand the impact of card removal on the flop when we hone in on the buttons over pairs we see that over pairs containing a club are actually betting with a slightly higher frequency compared to other over pair combos and the reason for this is likely because holding a club unblocks some of the over cards plus backdoor flush draw combos in the cutoffs range that are likely to continue when facing a bet in other words the solver prefers slow playing the over pairs that contain a heart spade or diamond because holding these suits decreases the probability that the cutoff will be able to call with a weaker hand and this in turn means that there will be fewer over pair heart spade and diamond combos in the bedding branch of the buttons game train hence when the cutoff holds ace jack of clubs on the turn it is blocking a greater proportion of over pair combos in the buttons range compared to ace jack of spades diamonds or hearts and thus by virtue of card removal the cutoff's likelihood of facing a stronger hand is decreased which means he should have a greater incentive to call now some of you exploitative wizards that are watching this are likely thinking to yourself that actually i'm really splitting hairs here and then in real life most players strategies are not refined enough to differentiate actions between suits in this way and so blockers and unblockers in this spot may not be relevant and you would be right and this raises a very important point that we need to be mindful of when it comes to using blockers and unblockers although card removal is a very important concept that nearly all strong players consider regularly we need to be careful of how we use them for a couple reasons first we should note that blockers and unblockers typically only change probability slightly unless ranges are very narrow and oftentimes other microanalysis factors namely rank kicker or draw equity will supersede the impact of blockers and unblockers when determining strategies at the start of this video we mentioned that card removal generally only has relevance near points of indifference which exists when two or more actions have the same or similar ev in these instances blockers and unblockers will shift the probabilities and evs just enough to push a hand towards one of the actions over the others but oftentimes the shift in evs will actually be relatively small for example when we go back to our hand we see that although the solver is calling with ace jack of clubs nearly 100 of the time and folding the other ace jack suited combos nearly 100 of the time the eevee differences for calling between all of these combos is less than one big blind in theory even if the ev of calling for eighth jack of clubs was one one hundredths of one big blind the solver should actually call with it one hundred percent of the time because the solver is supposed to always take the action that has the highest ev and the evf folding is always zero so the takeaway from this is that we need to keep things in perspective to avoid placing too high of a priority on card removal and this is why in the gto check system blockers and unblockers are only considered as the last step of the analysis when hero's class of hands is being played with a mixed strategy based on the macro and mesoanalysis so for example we see that top pair in this spot is essentially a pure call despite the fact that the combos in this class have different blocking and unblocking properties so scrutinizing carb removal to differentiate strategies among our top pairs would be putting the cart before the horse a second caveat to note is that the effect of blockers and unblockers is very sensitive to the assumptions we make about our opponent's range if our opponent is not playing gto the point of indifference will shift or in certain circumstances disappear entirely this is because the points of indifference at the nash equilibrium are determined assuming that our opponent is playing a perfectly balanced strategy and if they're not our borderline hands will generally prefer one action over the other because the evs between our options will no longer be the same so going back to our example in this spot the solver is determined based on villain's construction of value and bluffs that in addition to calling with most of our made hands and draws to avoid being exploited the cutoff also needs to call with some stronger ace highs but calling all of the stronger ace highs would be overcalling so the strategy is mixed based significantly on blockers and unblockers however if for example we knew with certainty that the button under bluffs the turn then all of these points of indifference would shift to pure folds and our cutoff point for calling would move towards higher equity hands and if the opposite were true and we knew that the button over bluffs the turn then all of these points of indifference would shift to pure calls and our cutoff point for calling would move towards lower equity hands now this doesn't mean that blockers and unblockers would become totally irrelevant right they still may be relevant at the new 0.7 difference however using card removal to determine strategy with this particular class of hands would be a mistake and the cutoff would be better off utilizing exploitative information to make his decision in this specific spot so that is it for our summary on blockers and unblockers which i hope will be helpful for many of you thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced you", metadata={'source':

[Document(page_content="in this video we'll be providing an overview of two of the most important concepts in poker equity and ev as well as a new related concept which you may have heard me discuss in prior videos called evie regret in his seminal work expert heads up no limit hold'em will tipton defined equity as the share of the pot that a player expects to win on average if all betting is stopped and both players check to showdown in other words equity measures the likelihood or probability of our hand winning or tying against all of our opponent's possible hands across all possible run outs without taking into account future betting action knowing our likelihood to win is important because poker in essence is a game where we place wagers based on who we think will have the best hand at the end of the game to draw an analogy imagine if an nba team were going to play a high school team and you had the opportunity to bet on the game at even odds but the team you're allowed to bet on is chosen randomly if you had the opportunity to bet on the nba team you would bet an infinite amount because their likelihood to win would be very high but if you instead had the opportunity to bet on the high school team you would likely not bet at all because their likelihood to win would be very low similarly in poker putting aside bluffs and traps the higher equity your hand has generally speaking the more incentivized you should be to wager on winning by placing bets into the pot as such equity is the most commonly used measure of hand strength and it's particularly useful because it's expressed as a percentage between 0 to 100 and therefore you can compare hamstrings very easily across different scenarios however since equity does not take into account future bets its usefulness in practice is somewhat limited in reality unless everyone's all in players can place bets and cause others to fold thereby denying the realization of that equity so a hand like ace of spades seven of diamonds on this queen five two two tone board may have decent equity since it would be relatively likely to win if we fast forward it to showdown but unless we make a pair it will be very difficult for us to realize that equity if our opponent places one or more bets which equity does not take into account and this is where ev or expected value comes into play another seminal work the mathematics of poker defines the expected value of an action as the value of each potential outcome from taking such action multiplied by its probability all sum together a solver calculates ev for each combination within our range by playing out a single hand across all possible runouts and all possible strategies and counter strategies billions of times over and adding up the weighted average of all of the possible outcomes in terms of chips won or lost whether it be a showdown or upon a fold so unlike equity which focuses on the raw value of a hand eevee focuses on the relative value of each available action for a hand and takes into account all possible chance elements and future bets and folds going back to our example we see that although ace of spades seven of diamonds has much higher equity compared to jack of clubs ten of hearts this combo actually has significantly greater average ev because with both the backdoor flush draw and backdoor straight draw it has a better chance of realizing or even over realizing its equity since in addition to making a weak pair it has a chance to improve on many turn cards and make a very strong hand and win a bunch of chips on the number of rivers whereas ace of spades seven of diamonds has a much lower probability of making a very strong hand and even if it pairs its ace it will often be dominated and end up losing a lot of chips so although unlike equity ev is expressed in chips and not as a percentage and therefore it's more difficult to compare evs across different scenarios since ev tells us the average number of chips we should expect to win when taking an action when we make decisions at the felt we should always be striving to take the actions that we estimate have the highest ev making it the most important metric in poker and this brings us to the third concept for this video which is eb regret now you won't find evie regret defined in any literature on game theory or in any google search because it's a concept that we created to help simplify learning gto strategies the genesis of ev regret was born from the struggles that i personally went through to learn gto given poker's enormous complexity i knew that if i wanted to master gto i would have to learn it incrementally so i focused primarily on my biggest gaps in knowledge first which were the spots where there were major inconsistencies between the strategies that i thought were optimal and the strategies that were actually optimal as calculated by the solver and since ev is the most important metric in poker i used it as the primary measuring stick to assess the degree of this deviation if my strategies in a spot resulted in very large ev losses compared to gto i would pay special attention to the spot in an effort to understand why the solver was using a different strategy and then refine my logic accordingly however my strategies led to an error that resulted in a relatively small led loss i would typically focus much less attention on the spot because i knew there would be plenty of other areas that i could study and gain more ev which would be a much more efficient use of my time right often the strategies determined by the solver are the result of how the player's ranges uniquely match up against each other down to fractions of combos so small eb losses may be the result not of an inherent flaw in strategic logic but rather due to not being familiar enough with the spot to know where the exact cutoff points lie which is more of a matter of practice and repetition for example let's assume that in this hand the action went check check on the flop the turn was the five of hearts and the big blind needs to decide if he should check again or bet while holding ten of clubs jack of hearts a common logic that might be employed in this type of spot could be something to the effect of the following with jack high we have no showdown value and the button is likely not to be very strong after checking a flop that was favorable to him so we should try to bet to get a fold and in terms of the sizing we want to target mainly ace high type of hands that would have checked the flop so we're going to bet two thirds pot and we have plenty of 5x and queen x in our range that will support this sizing now this strategy sounds somewhat reasonable but how do we test the validity of our hypothesis well we can examine the evs for the different actions for our combo since as noted earlier eevee tells us how much we should expect to win by taking each action in this case we have five available actions that 150 percent of pot that full pot that two-thirds pot bet third pot or check with the optimal frequencies for each action displayed under the action columns and the ev of taking each such action displayed in the next column to the right here we see that the ev for betting two-thirds pot with this combo is .2993 big blinds this means that if we decide to bet ten of clubs jack of hearts two-thirds pot against all of our opponents possible hands and counter strategies and across all possible river cards on average we should expect to win 0.2993 big blinds but of course since eb is not standardized as a percentage like equity it's only valuable as a measurement tool when we can compare it to the evs of our alternative actions in this case we see that the action with the highest db is actually to bet 150 percent of pot however the ev difference between betting 150 percent versus betting two-thirds pot is only around 0.01 big blinds so this is a situation where i think we can conclude that either play is generally solved or approved and therefore it wouldn't make much sense to spend a ton of time trying to figure out why the solver prefers the larger bet here but does the fact that we have confirmed that our play for our specific hand was solver approved mean that the logic we use for making our decision to bet all jack hi hands and below was sound not so fast if we check another jack hi combo such as jack of spades aided diamonds we see that the eev for checking is significantly higher than all of the betting options so if we had stopped our review after only checking the strategy for our particular hand 10 club jack of hearts it would have likely reinforced the idea that our overall logic was sound but it wasn't it was overly simplified the reality is that the big line arrives at the turn with essentially 100 of its range because it wasn't really donking the flop and so it has a ton of weak combos in its range many of which have better bluffing properties such as numerous straight and flush draws so we can't just bluntly bluff all of our combos that are jack high or below if we want to avoid overbluffing in this case even though ten of clubs jack of hearts doesn't have a draw it's a particularly good combo to barrel because it blocks both flush draws and will be a strong bluffing candidate on club or hard rivers but not all combos in this class share these attributes in other words checking a sim to see if how we played our specific hand was solver approved has limited usefulness because it's highly unlikely that we will ever encounter the exact same spot with the exact same combo ever again however it is much more valuable to check a sim to see if our logic or the heuristics we use to make our decision or solve are approved because generalized heuristics can be applied to a variety of spots that share common characteristics even if we have never studied those specific spots before and the only objective way to check if our logic is solver approved is by analyzing the strategies for all of the combos that fit within our heuristic however as you can probably imagine checking all of the evs for each such combo can be extremely tedious and time consuming although peel solver which is the solver that i primarily use to learn gto does have an eb comparison function you can only compare two actions at a time and you can't compare evs for select groups of hands so as the old saying goes necessity is the mother of invention and thus we created the eb regret algorithm to do this work for us instantaneously for each available action for a filtered group of hands evie regret compares the eevee of such action against the eevee of all other available actions for such group of hands if the ev of such action is the highest the ev regret is zero because it means that we will have no regrets to take that action over the other available options however when the eb for an alternative action is higher eb regret calculates the maximum amount of ev will lose expressed as a percentage of the pot by taking such action over the alternatives and so if we take a look at the class action table which calculates the average optimal frequencies and ev regrets for each action for the class of hands selected by the user we see that the eb red for checking this specific hand is zero since this is the action with the highest ev for this particular hand this means that if we decided to use a pure strategy and just check this combo 100 of the time in this exact spot then we would not lose anything in expectation against a gto opponent in contrast we see that the ev regret for betting third pot is 4.1 percent of the pot which is due to the fact that the ev of betting one third pot is significantly lower than the action with the highest dv in this case checking this means that the amount that we should expect to lose on average for betting third pot instead of checking would be around 0.2 big blinds against the g2 opponent now obviously just calculating the ev regret for a single combo like this doesn't really add much value the true usefulness of this metric becomes apparent when we're able to quickly measure the max ev loss across larger groups of hands without having to analyze each hand individually for example if we remove the filter for this specific combo the class action table has now recalculated the average frequencies and eb regret for all of the jack 8 off combos in our range and we see that the ev regret for checking all of these combos is just 0.5 percent of the pot which means that if we decide to simply check each of our jack ate off combos in this spot we won't be losing much in ev and we're able to ascertain this instantaneously instead of having to examine each of these combos individually but of course grouping just our jack adolph combos together and analyzing their strategies isn't all that useful either right in this type of spot is there really anyone that would devise a unique strategy specifically for their jack eight off combos alone no it's much more likely the case that most would devise a strategy for a larger region of their range such as hands with little to no showdown value so let's zoom out even further by focusing on all of our unmade hands which are not ace or king high and now we see that the ev regret for betting two-thirds pot with all the hands in this class is greater than five percent of the pot which means that the logic we employed here to bet all hands jack high and lower two thirds pot will lose us a maximum amount of around 0.24 big blinds of ev compared to the gto solution so ultimately you can view eb regret as a sort of quantification of opportunity cost there's an inherent trade-off when learning poker between simplification and ev retention and since the human race is not a monolith gto check leaves it up to the individual user to determine his own appropriate balance between simplification and eb retention some people have more experience or greater capacity to process information than others so it'd be silly for us to try to ordain a one-size-fits-all approach to learning also not everyone is interested in employing perfect gto strategies for example if you're trying to exploit a player that you believe over folds on turns then a .24 big blind eb difference may be small enough such that when your opponent overfolds the ev of betting increases to the point that it actually surpasses the eevee of checking for all of these hands and in that scenario it would be more profitable to just bet all of these trash hands indiscriminately on the other hand if you're playing against a more balanced opponent that will have some traps in the range that you don't want to blast off against you can use evie regret as a measuring stick to help refine your strategies for example if we group all of these hands that have some sort of draw on the turn now we see that the ev regrets for betting two thirds pot full pot and 150 percent pot are one percent or less and then when we isolate our nothing hands without a draw the ev regret for checking all of these hands is 1.3 percent of the pot and the only hands in this class that are betting with high frequency have both a heart and a club so we could for example add more nuance to our logic by instead of simply bluffing all jack-high hands and below in this type of spot decide to bluff all jackai hands and below with a draw or which contain both flushed blockers and then give up with the rest now obviously this type of heuristic by definition will not be perfect in every situation also using eb regret in this way simplifies strategies by essentially looking through the solver's complex mixed frequencies however frequencies are still important for purposes of balance so completely ignoring them can open up one to being exploited that all being said it's impossible to memorize gto frequencies for the entire game and everyone needs to start somewhere so sacrificing some precision in a spot where simplifying does not result in a large ev loss will likely be a rational decision for most so that they can spend more time focusing on other areas where they have larger leagues so in summary equity ev and now ev regret are tools that we can use to objectively measure the strength of our hand and the profitability of our actions which greatly enhances our ability to rationally and efficiently analyze our strategic decisions that is a video for today thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced you",

[Document(page_content="pop quiz you're playing a six max cash game and you're in the low jack and look down at 10 of diamonds queen of clubs you roll high so you decide to open 2.25 x and the big blind calls assuming the big blind checks to you should your sea betting strategy be similar on these two boards the answer is that the optimal c betting strategies on these boards are actually very different in fact ten of diamonds queen of clubs specifically is bet nearly 100 of the time on the ace jack 6 rainbow board and checked nearly 100 percent of the time on the ace jack 5 2 tone board if you're interested to learn why this is this video is for you in poker strategy videos you'll often hear people talk about range advantage as a critical factor in determining strategies so what exactly is range advantage and why is it so important well to start we should probably define what a range is in the first place since each player's dealt two cards face down that the other players cannot see poker is known as a game of incomplete information this means that in the vast majority of cases we don't exactly know where our cards rank relative to our opponents however we still need to make betting and calling slash folding decisions based on our probability of winning the pot so the logical way to address this dilemma is by assigning certain cards to our opponent that he's likely to have based on his prior actions which is referred to as range construction right initially everyone has an equal probability of receiving all the 1326 potential hand combinations in the deck but once players start to take actions we can make rational judgments about the types of hands the player should or should not have based on such actions for example i recently played a test hand in a six max cash game where i was cut off and opened with sixes my opponent on the button three bet and i called in this case when the button three bet he's signaling that he likely has a strong hand that doesn't mind playing for a large pot in other words unless he's mike possible it's very unlikely that he's holding a hand with very poor equity like 7 deuce off so we can rationally remove some of these hands by process of elimination the collection of all possible hands a player likely has at any given point is his range and range advantage generally refers to a situation where one player likely has a greater percentage of stronger hands in his range than the other given the board texture and we emphasize that the range advantage is determined by having a higher percentage of strong hands not based on having a higher absolute number of strong hands this is due to the fact that poker is a game of probabilities so we want to know who has the higher likelihood of holding the best hand which is determined by percentages and not absolute values so going back to our example the flop was eight seven three rainbow i checked he bet half pot and i called the turn was a five i checked again he bet three quarters pot and i called with the open ender the river was a nine completing my straight and i shoved just over pot now at first glance this may seem like a crazy donk shove and i frankly wasn't sure if it was good at the time but when i ran this hand through the solver i was surprised to see that the solver actually shoves over one third of its range on this river and the reason for this primarily is range advantage after calling the three bet out of position and calling two moderate to large bets on the flop and turn most of the hands that i likely had in my range at this point were smashing this river as we can see by the darker shade whereas although the bun also has strong hands here he's quite broadway heavy particularly with over pairs so the probability of villain checking behind was likely quite high so despite the fact that the button was the aggressor on all three streets prior and had a major advantage the whole way due in large part to the single card on the river the range advantage completely shifted in my favor thereby warranting taking a very aggressive line right if we take a look at the equity tiers we see that over half my range has greater than 75 equity and nearly one quarter of my range is comprised of straights so in other words range advantage can be thought of as a sort of barometer of how aggressive a player can be in a given spot in conjunction with other factors such as position and spr this is because when we have a range advantage it means that the probability of us holding a stronger hand is increased which in turn means that our opponent should be more likely to fold right this column here shows the percentage of hands our opponent should be folding at the equilibrium to each of these bets which is quite significant and when our opponent is more prone to fold this gives our bluffs and on earlier streets our protection bets a greater incentive to fire which in turn provides cover for our value bets to play aggressively as well so for example if we isolate just the combos that are shoving with greater than 50 frequency which we can do by clicking here we see quite clearly how the sauber is pairing its bluffs with its value bets in this spot right we see the jack high straight and top set being flanked by these 9x bluffs we see the 6x straights being flanked by these ace five and five four bluffs and finally we have pocket fours and pocket deuces which are being turned into bluffs likely due to the fact that they are unblocking some of the weaker made hands that dylan is likely to fold such as 9x and some over pairs and unfortunately in this case after a long tank our opponent did end up folding so we'll never know what he had so now that we have a general idea of what range advantage is let's go back to revisit our pop quiz from the start of this video where the lojack had a c betting decision on two ostensibly similar looking boards one thing to note is that on both boards the lojack actually has a very significant advantage at the top of the range but on the ace jack 5 2-tone board the solver is doing a lot more checking so why is this well if we examine the lower equity tiers although the in-position player does have an advantage throughout the advantage is not as significant and this is why you'll often see people break down range advantage into two categories a nut advantage and a general equity advantage a player has a nut advantage when he has the higher percentage of the very strongest hands that will often want to get stacks in by the river and a player has an equity advantage when he has a stronger range overall usually including among lower tiered hands on the flop when the in-position player has both the nut and equity advantage the solver will often bet nearly its entire range with a small sizing as we can see in this aggregated report showing the c betting frequency for the lojack against the big blind across all possible flops this small bet leverages the in position player's advantage throughout the range which will often be on very dry boards to obtain a greater percentage of folds for its bluffs and protection bets since the big blind will typically have fewer hands that can continue on these boards even against a small bet and since the aggressor's stronger hands do not want folds they also have an incentive to bet small to induce calls thus on these types of boards most of the in-position players weak medium and strong hands will often have the incentive to merge towards one small sizing in contrast when the in-position player has a nut advantage but not necessarily an equity advantage throughout the range the solver may not range bet small because such a bet will not be as effective to fold out villains plentiful moderate equity hands so instead the solver will often use relatively larger sizings in a more polarized manner additionally on low connected boards a greater proportion of the big blind range will have decent equity which means more calling and this in turn means the in position players range advantage and fold leverage is diminished resulting in more checking so going back to our hand the five instead of the six and the two tone board instead of the rainbow board provide the big blind with a number of decent equity hands that will not likely fold to a small bet as they have the ability to make strong hands on later streets specifically the big blind has a number of wheel draws as well as flush draws that the in position player does not have particularly since the ace and jack are suited which blocks some of the in-position player's strongest flush draws and unblocks the out-of-position player's weaker flush draws accordingly the out-of-position player's advantage with these draws increases its overall equity in the middle to lower portion of the range this coupled with the fact that ace high boards tend to mitigate range advantage and also reduce the need for protection result in a lot more checking on the ace jack 5 2 tone board with a more polarized betting range so that was a very high level summary of one of the most important concepts in poker range advantage which will often significantly influence how we should play our individual hands thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced you", metadata={'source': 'P0jy6yML308', 'title': 'Range Advantage Explained |

[Document(page_content="the gto vs exploitative cold war is over yes there are a select few that continue to wage this war primarily those who either do not understand game theory or that profit off of ignorance but this debate is now largely one-sided as far as i'm aware there is no player that actually understands game theory who believes that exploitative information should be totally ignored when it's available while it is true that you can become a winning player by utilizing a purely gto or a purely exploitative style the truth is to maximize your eevee regardless of the stakes or type of game you play you should become proficient at both some abstracted form of gto should serve as your foundation and exploitative adjustments should be layered on top when appropriate and we can learn how to effectively do both by using solvers as most of you know the primary function of a solver is to calculate unexploitable gto strategies but solvers can also calculate strategies that maximally exploit an opponent's known weakness through its node locking feature which we'll demonstrate in this video now to explain what node locking is it may make sense to refresh our recollection on how gto strategies are calculated by a solver simply put a solver calculates the gto strategies for two players let's call them player a and player b by simulating a hand scenario billions of times over in each iteration that's played the solver gradually shifts each player's strategies towards plays that make the most chips and away from the strategies that lose the most chips until it reaches the point that no further chips can be made on average by changing either player's strategies further this point is referred to as the nash equilibrium and the resulting strategies are commonly known as game theory optimal which cannot be improved assuming neither player shifts his strategies which he will have no incentive to unilaterally do but what happens when our assumption is wrong and player b deviates from his perfect gto strategy because he knows no better well in most cases this will mean that player a's gto strategy will no longer be the best strategy that maximizes his expectation against player b player a's gto strategy will still be effective and unexploitable but it will no longer be the most profitable and this is where no locking comes into play node locking allows us to isolate player b's deviation from gto and then recalculate the strategies for player a to identify the actions that will maximize his profits against player b's leak sounds amazing right well although node locking is an extremely powerful tool there are a few caveats that we should note about its use which we'll highlight through an example so this is a six max test hand i played where the small blind raised and i called in the big blind with queen jack off the flop was queen 10-8 rainbow the small blind checked and i checked back the turn was the ace of diamonds the small blind bet around 75 pot and i called the river was a seven of clubs and a small blind over bet around 1.5 x pot and after a long tank i called and got shown a seven for two pair according to gto my call was a pretty clear error although it didn't result in a huge ev loss the solver is showing some frequency of calling with queen jack off but it's doing so minimally and the eb for calling all of these hands is negative so you can assume that they are just pure folds one of the factors that i considered in my decision making process was that i thought this particular opponent may have been over bluffing now obviously in this instance i ended up guessing wrong but for the sake of discussion what would have been the most profitable play on average if my assumption about my opponent overbluffing turned out to be true well we can use node locking to find out now you can't node lock within the gto check browser but what you can do is download the file for your solved hands and explore the full game tree and load lock turns and rivers with the free version of simple post flop so here we're looking at the small blinds perfectly balanced gto betting strategy on the river and to node lock all we have to do is right click on the action where we think the player has a leak select edit strategy and then a pop-up will appear which will allow us to modify the small appliance strategy so since we want to see how my strategy should change if my opponent is over bluffing let's isolate the small blind's trash hands and let's say for example that instead of betting 25 big blinds seven percent of the time on average with king six suited the small blind was betting 25 big blinds 15 of the time with this combo we just need to type 15 into this box click king 6 suited and then press apply and now we see these lock icons appear meaning the strategy has been fixed and then the last step is to recalculate the river to see how the solver shifts its strategy to exploit this over bluffing imbalance by the small blind and now we see that my calling frequency shoots up over 2x compared to the gto calling frequency when we alter the small blinds bluffing strategy just a tiny bit the impact of the big blind's calling range is quite substantial including turning queen jack off into a pure call so obviously node locking is a very powerful tool because it allows us to precisely calculate the optimal way to exploit a known leak but what about those caveats i mentioned earlier well the first caveat is that what we are doing when we node lock is we are essentially fixing our opponent's leak as a new rule in the game that our opponent must abide by indefinitely however in reality our opponent is free to change his strategy at any time and if he does and we don't recognize it quickly enough we will be exposed to counter exploit so in other words when we change our strategies away from the baseline to exploit we are intentionally making our own play imbalanced which can then be taken advantage of which note locking does not account for the second caveat is that when you lock the strategy for a particular node but leave the rest of the game tree unlocked the solver will compensate for the handicap strategy by altering its actions in other branches of the game tree to recover as much of the lost eevee resulting from the leak as possible but in reality if your opponent is significantly imbalanced it will be highly unlikely that he will be able to adjust and compensate in other branches in the same way as a solver this means that the strategy that we have no locked and have recalculated our strategy against is not the actual strategy that our opponent will be using to precisely replicate fixed imbalances in our opponent's strategy you would actually need to no lock the entire game tree across all possible actions and run outs which is not possible to do and the third caveat is that in order to node lock with precision you need to know the exact imbalance or leak of your opponent which of course is not knowable right there is no mode with the solver where you can generally lock a player's strategy based on him being loose or tight or bluff heavy you need to modify specific combos within his range down to the percentage point which will essentially be an arbitrary guess and as we saw with our example when we changed the bluffing frequency by just eight percent for a single cluster of combos that was only present in the range a fraction of the time the big blind's calling strategy dramatically shifted by more than double the upshot of this is that if our guest regarding the imbalances of our opponent's range is wrong our resulting adjustment could be a huge mistake so do these caveats mean that node locking is useless well no no locking is still the only way to objectively calculate how to exploit an imbalanced opponent so this tool still can be very helpful if we are thoughtful about how we use it and i have a few suggested tips on how to do this in a practical way the first tip is instead of focusing on trying to memorize and implement the specific frequencies produced by the solver after a node lock we should focus primarily on the direction of the solver's adjustment for example in this case when our opponent bluffs too much relative to his value combos and the size of the bet the solver's adjustment was to expand our calling range now that may be obvious even without node locking but what is less obvious are the peripheral effects in other nodes of the game tree which the solver can help us identify for example instead of my opponent over bluffing let's assume that i as the big blind will always over bluff in this type of spot by 2xing the pot when the out of position player checks to me at the equilibrium when facing a small blind check the solver bets 2x pot around 3 percent of the time what happens when we node lock the big blind strategy to 2x the pot with 50 percent all of its unmade hands well in addition to the small blind increasing its calling frequency significantly downstream we see that the solver also increases its checking frequency upstream right the big blinds leak only occurs after a small blind check so the solver stuffs a greater proportion of its range into the checking line to take advantage of this including by doing more slow playing with its two pairs and top pairs which will now get additional ev by bluff catching the second tip is that once we know the direction of our adjustment we should shift all of our hands that were mixed at the equilibrium to pure strategies along that direction and the reason for this is that at the nash equilibrium to achieve perfect balance and unexploitability the solver allocates certain frequencies to certain actions and fills up these frequencies in a very precise way by mixing in combos that are at the threshold between such actions for example when facing the small blind river bet the solver allocated just enough combos to cause to avoid being exploited and that exact defense frequency required that the combos that were the most marginal calls where the evs of calling and folding were the same be played with split frequencies in other words the solver couldn't just call all of the big blinds marginal hands or else it would be over calling and it couldn't fold all of them or else the big blind would be over folding so these threshold hands are mixed just enough to get the solver to the appropriate defense frequency however once the equilibrium is broken all the hands that were indifferent and mixing between calling and folding from a gto perspective will now strictly prefer to call since the solver only mixes strategies between two actions in theory when the evs of such actions are the same so when the small blind deviated from his perfectly balanced gto strategy by over bluffing even slightly the eevee of the big blind calling will also increase slightly and since the eva fold is always zero this means that all of the borderline hands will now be pure calls because in theory the solver always takes the actions that produce the highest dv and the third and final tip is that after shifting all of our cutoff hands from mix to pure we should assess where the new cutoff point should be based on the degree of our opponent's deviation the greater our opponent's deviation from gto the farther we should adjust our cutoff points which means that some of our combos may shift from being pure to being mixed and some of our combos may shift from being pure in one direction to being pure in another direction for example in our original node locked hand the degree of the small blind's deviation was relatively minor we increased the bluffing frequency of a combo that was in the range a fraction of the time by only eight percent and this resulted in the solver moving the cutoff point for calling to around third pair but what happens when we increase the bluffing frequency for this one combo to 50 percent well we see that the cutoff point for the big blind calling is now at weak pair all of these 8x combos turn into pure calls because their evs for calling increased a few big blind across the board due to the greater degree of imbalance in the small blinds bluffing range and this highlights why even when we're facing an imbalanced opponent knowing the baseline gto strategy can still be quite useful ultimately the main thing that changes when we exploit an imbalanced opponent is the cutoff point between different actions in relation to our range all of the fundamental principles that drive gto strategies such as range advantage position sbr card removal etc still apply and when we are well studied in theory we will have a better sense of range construction and how these cutoff points should shift due to our opponent's imbalance based on our assessment of where additional ev is being generated from so that is a video for today thanks for

[Document(page_content="this video is the second of a four part series covering the components of gto check in this video we're going to provide an overview of the gto check solver dashboard and an in-depth look at the charts in the first level first let's talk about the overall philosophy behind the structure and layout of this dashboard as was mentioned in the first part of this video series solvers calculate the strategies that maximize the average number of chips each player is expected to win over the long run assuming that each player is doing his best to adjust against his opponent and win the most number of chips possible when solvers were first publicly released around 2015 they caused a major sea change in the poker community and as a result strategies have improved significantly across the board we no longer have to guess what the correct play is in a vacuum we can easily obtain mathematically derived strategies that are proven to be effective there is however one inherent flaw in the strategies calculated by solvers in reality solvers are not very sophisticated machines they have only one function to simulate a hand countless times over with the sole objective being to follow the strategies that win the most chips over the long run solvers don't have any sort of formal strategy or system of play that we can learn from they just identify the lines that make the most profit through brute force and then they spit out the resulting data in the form of numbers it's up to us humans to decipher what this data means so that we can apply it to our games in practice and given that there are more possible scenarios in poker than there are atoms in the universe this is an enormously complex task so what we have done with gto check is we have taken years of solver work and research and devised a system that's designed to structure the solvers outputs in a manner that we believe is most conducive to learning the fundamental principles that drive these profit maximizing strategies and the way we accomplish this is through a system of scalable simplification that is we start our analysis at the highest level of abstraction possible and we only move on to the more granular when doing so is necessary to improve our strategy significantly so what do we mean by abstract and granular well in order to understand this we first need to step back and define what a range is and why it is important since poker is a game of incomplete information where each player's cards are dealt face down in order for players to make rational decisions they must assess the likelihood of their opponents holding certain cards the collection of all possible hands a player is likely to have is called his range this range is shaped by a player's actions at previous decision points and affected by new community cards so for example if in a cash game the hijack 3 bets the lojack it would be unlikely that the hijack has a hand like 10 deuce offsuit or queen 3 off suit but it's very possible the hijack would have aces or kings or ace king and if the flop comes king king jack there's a high probability that the hijack will have made a strong hand on this board including over pairs trips full houses and quads and so when the low jack is deciding whether he should call a c bet holding a marginal hand like pocket sixes for example he needs to think about the very real possibility that he may be behind the way a strategic player does this is by assessing how the hijacks range of possible hands intersects with the board and every player even the most unsophisticated one does this at some level even when you're playing against grandpa for pennies he will know that certain boards favor the pre-flop aggressor and this will affect the decisions he makes what differentiates the best players in the world is that they're able to make this type of assessment very accurately by deftly gauging the opponent's range of possible hands at each stage of the game so when we're playing against a strong opponent who is making decisions based on our likely hands in order to make his life difficult we should be simultaneously also thinking about the possible hands in our range and how they want to play at each decision point because this exercise will help us disguise our actual holdings and this is one of the reasons why you often hear the concept of balance being closely associated with gto when we balance our range by playing groups of hands with disparate strength similarly it makes it very difficult for our opponent to put us on a particular holding or to figure out our overall strategy and ultimately poker is a game of subterfuge and deception so this concept is critically important for example we've all played against old man coffee that never bluffs and only bets on the river for value this player is easy to play against because his range and strategies are very transparent we know he always has it so we can easily overfold when he shoves the river we can avoid playing like old man coffee by always being conscious of our range and balancing it so that we can potentially have a variety of different holdings at any given time however the reality is that in real time it's impossible to balance each combination in our range in any sort of precise manner so the way we simplify this balancing process is that instead of trying to formulate a unique strategy for each individual hand we craft overarching strategies that apply to groups of hands in our range and sometimes we can even utilize the same strategy indiscriminately with all of the hands in our range which greatly simplifies the game for example here is a gto check report for a 6 max 100 big blind three bet pot where the in position player is the aggressor as described in the first part of this tutorial series this report shows the average range frequencies for each player across all 1755 strategically unique flops so here we're looking at the hijack c betting strategy after three betting the lojack and when we sort by flops where the hijack bets quarter pot most often we see that there are a number of boards where the solver is betting essentially its entire range with this sizing each of these values and accompanying bars show what percentage of the player's range takes each action when playing optimally so in this case on a king king jack rainbow board the optimal strategy is for the hijacked to bet quarter pot 92.84 percent of the time which for simplification purposes we can assume is 100 of the time in other words instead of trying to devise a strategy for each of the combinations that the hijack is actually dealt in the spot five six of hearts or pocket tens or ace queen off etc etc he can simply see bet all of these hands quarter pot on these dry king high boards or paired broadway boards and his play will be in alignment with the optimal profit maximizing strategy thus this type of abstraction greatly simplifies the game because it means that when we know the one optimal strategy for the entire range we also automatically know the optimal strategy for each individual combination within the range as well of course this type of abstraction won't always be possible we can't just blindly play all of the different hands in our range the same way in every situation and just get away with it against most opponents more often than not different hands in our range will have drastically different incentives which adds complexity to our strategies for example let's instead find a flop where the hijack is doing a lot of mixing such as this 876 rainbow board on this type of board certain hands in the hijacks range will have a strong incentive to bet such as the nut straight that wants to begin building a pot other hands like king seven of clubs don't really want to start blasting off on this board and would rather try to get to later streets or showdown however it is impossible to know or devise a unique strategy like this for each of the combinations in a player's range across scenarios so what are we supposed to do we can't simplify things and play our entire range the same way in a spot like this but at the same time we can't craft the unique strategy for each single combination in our range either because that is not humanly possible this is where gto check's philosophy of systematic simplification comes into play that is even if we can't simplify things by playing our entire range the same way we can still utilize abstractions so that we can play groups of hands within our range the same way this technique is called bucketing and i've made a separate video covering this topic which i will link in the description below essentially bucketing just means that we create a class of hands with similar strength attributes and play them the same way instead of trying to individually reason about each combination that's within the class so for example this board generally favors the lojack caller because his range of likely hands is smashing this board with straights sets and two pairs so we generally don't want to build up a big pot particularly with our middling hands but instead of trying to devise a unique strategy for each of our middling hands like ace seven of clubs or king eight of diamonds we can just bucket them all together and play them the same way by checking the flop and this strategy will be generally consistent with the optimal strategy for each individual combination within this class and this encapsulates the central thesis of the gtl check solver dashboard it is a system of cross filtering charts which allows us to slice and dice a player's range to generate custom classes of hands with varying levels of abstraction and objectively measure whether grouping such hands in this manner retains fidelity to the optimal solution the default state of the dashboard is unfiltered which means it's showing data for all of the hand within both players ranges however chart by chart we can start to apply filters that break down these ranges across various categories such as by their equity or ev by hand segments by the presence or absence of various draws by card removal characteristics or by suits or specific card ranks our goal is to use these charts and filters to identify strategies that we can apply to the broadest group of hands possible because as we've discussed this simplifies the game and this concept of starting with the abstract and advancing towards the granular is natural to the human mind and it's how we tend to make sense of a complex world and also how we most efficiently learn intricate subject matters and this applies to poker strategy as well whether players are fully aware of it or not everyone actually uses bucketing outside of a few exceptions players devise strategies not for specific combinations but rather for categories of hand classes for example in this hand a player in the hijack isn't going to devise a unique strategy specifically for ace of clubs queen of hearts and then differentiate that strategy with how he would play asa club's queen of diamonds all players will bucket these hands together in a category for class of hands such as two overs without a backdoor flush draw or a strong ace or ace queen off etc etc each person has their own unique way of bucketing hands but all do it what distinguishes the top players from beginners is that just like every other skill or area of learning experts will understand and be able to execute on a more granular level compared to beginners who start out at a very abstracted simplified level and we believe that poker players should study the same way that they naturally learn and play so how in practice do we use these filters to move from the abstract to the granular well the reality is users can filter their ranges and create classes in any way that suits them and the gtojek solver allows for tremendous flexibility in this regard but to assist users with developing a systematic method of reviewing and analyzing hands the dashboard has been deliberately structured in three levels of decreasing abstraction from top to bottom the first level is the highest level of abstraction which we refer to as the macro analysis and it focuses on the strategies of the overall range the second level is called the mesoanalysis and it focuses on the strategies for hand classes and finally the third and final level is the microanalysis which focuses on the strategies for individual combinations so how do we know when we should be progressing through these levels and moving from an abstract strategy to a more granular one well just like the solver each and every poker player's sole objective regardless of whether you're playing live or online mtt cash heads up or whether you're playing against strong or weak opponents should be to maximize the number of chips you have at the end of the game and there's a metric produced by the solver which actually precisely calculates this amount known as expected value or eb for short when a solver simulates a hand it tracks the number of chips it wins or loses for each trial based on the actions taken during such trial expected value measures the average number of chips each action will yield by the end of the game over the course of billions of trials so the way we decide when we should be refining our abstractive strategy and getting more granular is by focusing on the point when the abstracted strategy starts to lose a significant amount of expected value compared to the optimal strategy and in the gtl check solver this is measured through ev regret now i've done a separate video on ev and ev regret which i will leave a link in the description for but generally for each action available to the player to act ev regret measures the maximum amount of expected value that player will lose if he chooses to take such action with 100 of the hand within the player's range or class of hands and this value is standardized by dividing it by the size of the pawns so going back to our example of hijack vs lojack in a three bag pot on a king king jack board we see that the evie regret for the hijack betting each and every single combination in its range quarter pot is zero this means that no matter which hand the hijack is actually holding whether it be four or five of spades or ace nine of clubs or pocket queens if the hijacks simply decide to bet all of these hands quarter pot his strategy will essentially be in perfect alignment with the solver's optimal strategy in contrast on the 876 board the ev regret for betting the entire range quarter pot is a whopping 15.3 percent meaning that if the hijack decided to bet all of the hands in this ranged quarter pot in this spot he will lose a maximum of 2.8 big blinds compared to the optimal strategy which is quite significant so in a scenario like this the idea is that we need to refine our strategy by making it more granular and we do this by breaking down our strategy into hand classes and we will continue to break down our range into smaller and smaller pieces until we reach the point where we find a group of hands which when we play them the same way will not result in a significant eb loss compared to the optimal strategy now this of course raises the question of what constitutes a significant ev loss that should prompt us to drill down to more granularity well this question depends entirely on each individual user and this flexibility is how gto check provides a very elegant solution to the problem that persists with both training materials and tools which is that they are not customized to each user's individual experience level and ability to absorb information since the abstracted strategy is the simplest and the granular strategy is the most complex beginners should choose a relatively high eb regret threshold perhaps somewhere around three percent this allows someone new to gto to get their feet wet with theoretical concepts without getting inundated with all of the minutia of the solver's intricate strategies however if you're a more experienced player you'll want to set your eb regret threshold lower perhaps somewhere around one percent this allows more advanced players to incrementally capture more and more ev from the gto strategies which will be helpful to gain small edges against tougher opponents who are able to exploit imbalances and as a player progresses in his knowledge of gto he can gradually lower his eb red threshold in lock stack one caveat we should note here is that when we bucket hands together we are potentially running the risk of straying from the optimal frequencies defined by the solver for example in certain scenarios the solver may show one action as having zero ev regret for a class of hands but the solver is nevertheless splitting its frequencies for such class among multiple actions this may occur for example if there is one or a handful of combos within the class that strictly prefer to take the action with zero eevee regret but the majority of other combos in the class mix between multiple actions in these sorts of instances although choosing to take the action that has zero evie regret with all the combos within the class will not make a player vulnerable against an opponent who himself is playing gto this strategy may be exploited by an opponent that is closely tracking frequencies so in these instances even if the e regret for a particular action is low it may still make sense to refine the class further so we have now established that we can greatly simplify our learning of gto by developing overarching strategies that can be applied to broad groups of hands or even our entire range to certain circumstances but how do we actually execute these strategies when we're sitting at a table without these charts in front of us well as mentioned earlier it's our philosophy that players should learn poker in the same manner that they play and so gto checks tri-level system is not only a methodology of learning it also provides a structured way to analyze hands which focuses us on the most important factors that drive ev maximizing strategies for every single strategic decision at the felt and for the remainder of this video we're going to delve into the first most abstract level the macro analysis you", metadata={'source': 'zIg9I74DyX4', 'title': 'How to Systematically Simplify GTO: From Beginners to Experts',

[Document(page_content="today we've released another update to the gto check solver dashboard the equity graph has been revamped to conform more closely to the type of equity graph that many are familiar with which has been implemented in some form in a number of solvers and other tools in the past this graph plots each hand within both players ranges depicting its rank in each player's overall equity distribution the y-axis shows the equity of each plot at hand scaled from zero equity at the bottom to 100 equity at the top and the x-axis shows the percentile strength ranking of such hand from weakest to strongest left to right based on its relative weight within the distribution so for example in this hand which is from a six max cash game where the small blind three bet the button the nuts are pocket eights on this board so if we isolate just the pocket eights we see that the equity of this hand is very high and it's at the 100th percentile of the small blinds range this type of graph can be quite useful to help us understand how ev maximizing strategies are driven in a number of ways for one it provides a very clear visualization of the strength of both players ranges at a glance which allows us to better assess how overall range compositions affect strategies so in this case we see that the ranges are quite symmetrical throughout most of the range up until around the 70th percentile which represents hands with around 60 equity or less the ranges are very similar it's only when we go above this point that the ranges start to diverge where for the next 25 or so of the range the small blind has a clear advantage likely primarily due to its over pair advantage and then at the very top of the ranges the in position player appears to retake the advantage however since this segment represents such a small part of the range it isn't very easy to make out so we've added this zoom bar at the bottom which allows us to hone in on select portions of the equity distribution to take a closer look all we have to do is brush in the area we want to focus on and then this chart will redraw so that the view becomes much more fine-grained and then we can brush this area where the in position player has the advantage which will isolate the specific hands in this region and now we can very clearly see the basis for the imposition player's advantage the buttons range contains more of the sets because he has fours and deuces which the small blind is unlikely to have as the pre-flop 3 better so the result of this dynamic where the ranges are symmetrical for most of the range and the button actually has the advantage with respect to the nuttiest hands coupled with the fact that the small blind is out of position results in a significant amount of checking by the small blind and when the small blind does bet it primarily uses the smaller quarter pot and half pot sizings another way this graph can be quite useful is that it allows users to create very precise buckets based on incremental equity so for example let's isolate the small blinds over pairs and then zoom in on this area and then let's brush the over pairs with the highest equity right at where this break exists not surprisingly these are the strong's over pairs queens through aces and we see that these hands are checking around 45 percent of the time on average and when they do bet they're splitting between the quarter pot and half pot sizings and because the eevee regret for all three of these options are relatively low just randomizing among these actions for this class should generally be fine now let's brush the next segment down which we see is comprised of tens through kings although queens and kings were also in the higher tier we see that the kings and queens in this tier do not contain the spade for the backdoor flush draw this tier of hands although checking around the same amount as the higher tier starts to utilize the larger three-quarter pot sizing and for the most part stops using the quarter pot sizing and then when we zero in on the lowest over pair tier which is comprised of nines and tens without a spade we see that the checking drops by more than half and this class starts utilizing the full pod sizing so why in the world are the stronger hands betting less often and utilizing smaller sizings whereas the weaker hands are betting more often and utilizing larger sizings well one of the primary reasons for this is protection as most of you know equity objectively measures the likelihood of a hand to win at showdown assuming both players check down so hands with higher equity are less likely to be outdrawn on later streets as such aces and kings and queens with a spade need relatively less protection and shouldn't mind seeing turns and possibly getting in multiple streams of value to grow the pond however there are many turns and rivers that will be terrible for nines and tens so these hands are more incentivized to bet bigger with a higher frequency to try to take the pot down now obviously these tendencies for these hands can easily and quickly be viewed by simply hovering over them in the heat map however this information by itself doesn't tell us why the solver is doing what it's doing and in the gtl check system we always want to understand the why because that logic and not these charts is ultimately what we will carry with us to use at the felt an equity will in many scenarios play a large role in explaining why the solver is doing what it's doing now let's see how these dynamics change when we get to the river after the small blind seabed's quarter pot and the button calls then the small blind checks a six of hearts turn the button that's 31 percent and the small blind calls and the river is the jack of spades now we see that the equity graph looks quite different the bottom 30th percentile of both players ranges are comprised of hands with lower than 30 equity and this group consists of a lot of two overs with hearts that on the flop were more likely to stab in the small blind shoes and call with the button shoes and which upgraded to a flush draw on the turn however after this point we see that the button has a pretty significant advantage for most of the rest of the range around 70 percent of its range is comprised of hands with around 65 equity or more whereas around 75 percent of the big blind range has less than 50 equity this makes sense since the big blind checked and the button bet the turn and also because the six and jack generally favor the buttons three bed calling range as he has a higher proportion of jackson sixes the net result of this is that the big blind is doing a lot of checking here over ninety percent of its range now let's move on to the buttons decision facing a check and isolate its top pairs which are mixing between checking and betting we can then hone in on the equity distribution of this specific class to try to ascertain how incremental equity is impacting the solver strategies and define the cutoff point between betting and checking so first if we isolate this cluster of combos at the very top of the distribution we see that these hands are betting essentially 100 of the time including by shoving over 40 percent of time so what do these hands have in common well they are all top pairs with top kicker which also contain the ace of spades flush blocker and then the rest of the top pairs all have around the same equity and are checking on average around 75 percent of the time with the hands betting most often being the other ace jack combos without the spade so in this node we see that incremental equity has a reverse impact for our top pairs when compared to its impact on the big blinds over pairs on the flop on the flop over pairs with higher equity were playing more passively because they didn't need as much protection as they were more likely to win at showdown whereas on the river since there are no more carts to come the sole focus of incremental equity with respect to the buttons top pairs is how far ahead these hands are compared to the big blinds range and whether they can be called by worse so in this quick video we showed just a few examples of how the new equity graph allows us to explore and dissect ranges which ultimately can be used to help us gain an understanding of how the solver is constructing its eb maximizing strategies", metadata={'source': 'tlQDDGx2YS4', 'title': 'Advanced Equity Analysis | GTOx Update', 'description': 'Unknown',

[Document(page_content="[Music] one of the biggest hurdles to learning to play theoretically sound poker is developing the ability to think in ranges to illustrate let's assume you're in a cash game in the cut off holding ace queen in a single raised pot on a queen queen 5 rainbow board what do you do the beginner would likely just auto bet based on the strength of their hand however from a theory perspective if you gave any answer to this question you would be wrong this is because the optimal strategy is heavily dependent on among other things how the ranges match up if villain was in the big blind then you would bet 100 of the time but if villain was on the button you would check nearly 100 of the time the reason for this discrepancy despite the fact that the cutoffs hand and range is exactly the same in both scenarios is because from a theory perspective we always want to take the actions that maximize ev which is determined by the probability of outcomes given the likely hands for both players or in other words the player's ranges however for many thinking in ranges can be difficult you have a limited time to act and in most situations the possible combos can number in the hundreds one common way to deal with this issue is to truncate your analysis by focusing on certain regions of the ranges that you think are the most prevalent since these are the hands that will impact the ev equation most significantly but there are a couple of potential pitfalls with this type of targeted analysis for one it's very easy to fall down a rabbit hole and get fixated on a handful of combos that may not be representative of the entire range this is especially true on the river where range construction requires an understanding of what the pre-flop ranges look like and how those ranges were subsequently altered on each street by player actions and the board cards keeping the universe of likely combos in your mind street over street can be overwhelming secondly even if you're able to accurately construct most of the player's ranges it can be difficult to then take the next step and estimate how to maximize ev with so many different combos floating in your head so today we're going to be discussing a concept that addresses both of these concerns range morphologies now range morphologies aren't new they've been discussed at length going years back however typically ranged morphologies have been analyzed in the context of very simplified toy games which have limited applicability to the full game of poker so we at gto check have developed more realistic paradigms of range morphologies for practical use and designed a new interface to help users build their understanding of this important concept this new interface is part of the launch of gto check 3.0 where we will also be introducing a new quick solving algorithm which allows users to calculate hundreds of hands in the cloud at a fraction of the previous cost check out the description if you want to learn more to illustrate the power of range morphologies we're going to analyze a few hands that i played during the course of testing so let's start by taking a look at one of the most common scenarios in poker where the button raised and i called in the big blind with queen nine of diamonds the flop came king king three i checked and the button bet third pot so not too surprisingly both of these plays are standard the big blind checks range and the button essentially bets range but let's stop to consider why this is the case when we take a look at the ranges and hand classes for both players juxtaposed they aren't too dissimilar both players have some trips some underpairs and a whole lot of trash so why are the strategies so drastically different between the two players well although position has some impact here the primary driver of these strategies is the range matchup between the players although the ranges on this board aren't completely dissimilar there are some key differences that have a significant impact to begin with the big blinds range is what we refer to as bottom heavy that is proportionally most of the range consists of trash and it is at a significant nut disadvantage a bottom heavy range is commonly created in one of two ways one when a player does not have the betting initiative limited bets have been placed meaning that his range is wide and the board either favors villain or is neutral so for example in most single raised or limped pots on many boards the big blind will have a bottom heavy range the second circumstance where a bottom heavy range is sometimes created is where a board dynamically and disproportionately creates many nudish hands for only one player for example when a run out gives villain many flushes or straights which renders hiro's range mostly trash offensively a bottom heavy range typically plays very passively and when it does bet it is usually on the smaller size defensively a bottom heavy range is often attacked with small sizings as we see is the case here on the flip side the buttons range is what we refer to as more balanced relative to the opponent's range with some weak some medium and some strong hands although the buns range is also wide as the pre-flop aggressor it has a not insignificant advantage at the top of the range with over pairs and a greater percentage of trips and this is a key difference a bottom heavy range is mostly capped whereas a balanced range will either have the nut advantage or at least have a significant proportion of notice hands himself additionally the button also has a greater percentage of stronger underpairs and less trash hence making it more balanced relatively speaking a balanced range will most often be created when a player has the betting initiative and the board either is favorable or neutral to that player a player without the initiative can also achieve a balanced range typically when the board becomes very favorable to him since the balance range is comprised of a full spectrum of different equity profiles defensively it can face a variety of bet sizings and raises targeting various regions of the range and offensively it may attack the opponent with a variety of sizes as well with the optimal sizing often dictated by villains range shape in cases like this where we have a balanced range versus a very bottom heavy range what we will often see is a small sizing used with very high frequency and we can understand why this is when we analyze each region of the balanced range from the eevee perspective first let's start with the button's weakest hands such as jack off queen 4 suited and 9 6 suited hypothetically if we were to play a passive checking strategy with these types of hands the most likely outcome is either we end up getting bluffed and forced to fold or we lose a showdown so the eevee of checking will be relatively low however since the big blind has a very bottom heavy range on this extremely dry board it means that the likelihood of him folding to even a very small bet is relatively high there's no straight draws no flush draws he has very few pairs and he can only draw to one over card in ace accordingly the buns ev for betting with its trash will be decent especially since from an efficiency standpoint a very small bet should result in a significant number of folds being out of position and at a significant nut disadvantage the big blinds simply will have a hard time defending with much of its range this concept of overfolding may seem foreign to those of you who have been indoctrinated in the church of mdf but the truth is that in most scenarios full percentage isn't dictated solely by the bet size range matchups also have a significant impact so since the ev for checking is low and the ev for betting is decent this means that basically all of the buttons trash will have an incentive to bet small in this spot to take the pot down now remember one half of the ev equations probability and the probability of getting folds versus this bottom heavy range is high now let's think about the buttons middling hands such as under pairs and 3x these hands are ahead of most of the big blinds range but they are very vulnerable to bad turns and rivers at the same time they don't really want to grow a large pot because if the big blind continues versus a large bet the button's middling hands will end up being behind most of the big lines calling range so when this class of hands can protect its equity by easily folding out a significant portion of the opponent's range with a small efficient bet the eevee for doing so will be relatively high and finally what about the button's strongest hands such as aces and king x well given that on this very dry board so much of the big blind range will struggle to continue these hands also don't mind betting small to entice asex and backdoor combos to stay in the pot and possibly pick up a draw or pair on later streets so from an ev perspective in this balanced versus bottom heavy matchup there is a strong incentive for all of the buttons equity classes to compress and utilize a small sizing throughout facing the small bet i decide to raise with my queen nine of diamonds and get the fold and we do see that the solver likes to raise this combo at a low frequency and it is in fact raising with around 23 percent of its range so why is this happening when the big blind has a bottom heavy range and is at a nut disadvantage well this is a good example of the full game of poker being much more complex and nuanced than a toy game model the reality is that most real life ranges in theory should have some mix of strong medium and weak hands they will just be weighted towards certain tiers of the equity distribution additionally this scenario highlights why nut advantage although important isn't everything and why thinking about the range as a whole is necessary for example both a balanced range and a polarized range which we will discuss later can have another advantage but they will often be played very differently given that the button is likely betting its entire range in this spot although its range is relatively stronger it is also quite wide itself with many hands completely whiffing on this board in other words the button's betting range being balanced has plenty of autofolds so we see that the big blind counter attacks with a number of underpairs and three x combos for protection king x hands that are happy to play a big pot and since there are no conventional draws on this board backdoor combos as bluffs such as the queen nine of diamonds i was holding here now let's take a look at another hand i played in the same button versus big blind configuration but where the range matchup is dramatically different due to the flop texture in this one i'm on the button with queens i raise and the big blind calls the flop is 1048 two-tone the big blind checks which we see is consistent with the strat on the king king three board but then i bet around three quarters pot and we see that the solver does like this larger sizing and is checking a significant portion of its range so why the stark difference especially when the player's ranges are identical to the prior scenario while the button's range is still likely bounced with the nut advantage and some medium and weak hands as well but on this board the big blind simply has a lot more equity it has plenty of 10x 8x and 4x it also has numerous flush draws and straight draws between the 4 and 8 and the 810 it also has a bunch of combos that have over cards and backdoor equity as well in short the big blinds range on this board is more aptly characterized as mid heavy a mid-heavy range is typically created in one of three ways one by being the pre-flop caller and the flop provides a number of weak connections to your range such as lower pairs and draws two by taking a passive check calling line versus multiple bets or three by having an ample proportion of nutted hands but choosing not to bet particularly when in position similar to a bottom heavy range a mid-heavy range is at a nut disadvantage and is therefore mostly capped so offensively it will generally play passively and when it does bet the bet will usually be small however unlike a bottom heavy range the mid heavy range isn't dominated by autofolds so defensively a mid-heavy range is typically attacked with larger bets from an ev perspective a small bed by the buttons weak and middling hands will simply not be as effective in terms of getting folds and the button's strong hands now have a plethora of decent equity combos and villains range that it can extract value from with bigger bets so here we see that the small bet is used at a much lower frequency instead the solver predominantly uses the 75 percent or even 120 sizings and the range is doing a good amount of checking this represents a more polarized betting scheme which typically will be the betting scheme that is used most often against mid heavy ranges and this is a good example of how understanding overall range morphologies can help guide us on how we should be playing individual hands unlike the last scenario since we're polarizing we won't be betting the middle part of our range with high frequency instead we'll be betting predominantly with our strongest hands including queens and some bluffs villain calls my bet the turn is the five of diamonds and the big blind checks again interestingly we see that unlike the flop the solver does a decent amount of leading now so why is this one thing we need to keep in mind is that ranged morphologies are not static and they can change depending on the runout if the turn river card is a brick then the range morphologies which were in place at the end of the immediately prior street will generally be retained in the new street which makes things a bit easier to interpret however when a out is very dynamic it can change the range morphologies for both players particularly when the run out uncapped a range that was mid or bottom heavy on the prior street which is exactly what happened here with the pre-flop ranges we use the big blind has seven six off in its range whereas the button only has 7 6 suited in its range which gives the big blind more straights the big line also has a higher percentage of two pairs including 10 5 and 10 4 suited and 8 5 and 8 4 suited in short this turn card uncaps the big blinds range making it more balanced prompting the solver to seize the initiative with a portion of its range by making a small bet and my range on the other hand is a representation of our final range morphology polarized as most of you know a polarized range consists primarily of very strong hands and very weak hands with relatively little in the middle a polarized range is typically created when a player has and maintains the initiative by betting across multiple streets usually with larger sizes designed to get stacks in by the river so in this case by being the pre-flop aggressor and continuing to bet on the flop with large sizing my range started to polarize because generally speaking mid-strength hands have a lower incentive to bet big since a big bet is more likely to cause villain to fold worse and only call with better now in this case the five turn depolarized my range to a certain extent by adding more strong hands to villains range which in turn weakened many of the hands in my range however overall my range is still mostly comprised of strong hands represented by the reddish colors and weak hands represented by the bluish colors because a polarized range tends to be mostly comprised of strong and weak hands most of the time the polarized range will be on offense since both of these classes of hands generally have a strong incentive to bet however in situations where a polarized range is on defense since the middle part of a polarized range tends to be lacking it will usually face smaller sizings targeting the trash portion of its range but in this case villain refrained from betting and so i continue with another three-quarters pot bet this lower card adds some lower pairs to the big blinds range such as 7 5 and 9 5 hearts on top of this when the big blind simply called my flop bet and refrained from donking on the favorable turn card it compressed his range towards the middle of the equity distribution even further the net result of all this is that the big blind range has become even more mid-heavy and so we aren't going to be using any small sizings in the buttons shoes we're betting three quarters pot or more to get max value with our strongest hands including our queens and to apply max fold leverage with our bluffs in an attempt to get the big blind to muck some of his weaker pairs and draws which it would be much less likely to do versus a smaller bet but the big blind calls the river is the seven of spades and then villain donks out 130 percent of the pot and i fold so according to the solver this donk by the big blind is simply not a thing it appears this was a case of someone playing based on the strength of his hand and not his range which as we said at the top is contrary to how theoretically sound strategies are constructed as we've established the big blind's range was very mid-heavy on the prior street and by calling the turn bet instead of raising we can remove even more of his strongest and weakest hands now this seven river does change the equities of both players to some degree since it brings in four to a straight which gives the big blind some nudged hands and diminishes the strength of many of my hands such as my pocket queens however overall the big blinds range by and large is still mid heavy and having placed three bets in a row my range in contrast is still mostly polarized and from a range morphology standpoint when a mid heavy range is matched up with a polarized range the mid heavy range particularly when out of position will rarely do any betting as it will typically go into pure bluff catcher mode allowing the polarized range to take the initiative remember a polarized range tends to be very offensive so even if the big blind had a straight here or some other strong hand checking to allow the polarized button to bet and then check raising would likely be the most profitable move in this case as mentioned the 7 isn't a total break because it does bring in a few straights and two pairs for the big blind which depolarizes the button's range to a certain extent but not quite enough for the big blind to donk out with an overbet particularly since the big blind should have donked or raised some of his 6x on the turn and the reason why in theory you don't want to form strategies based on the strength of your individual hand like this is because it will generally make you easier to play against as it narrows your range dramatically and magnifies the value of card removal from a theory perspective combos tend to like to move in groups because it helps with information hiding and this highlights why utilizing ranged morphologies can be very helpful if you're trying to play theoretically sound poker as mentioned it is very hard to retain in your mind all the likely combos in both players ranges from street to street it is much easier to keep mental tabs on the overall range shapes from prior streets and then in the current street reconstruct specific combos based on those morphologies to determine your strategy by going through the exercise of mentally categorizing each player's range it forces us to focus not just on specific regions or combos where it can be very easy to lose the force for the trees rather on how the range as a whole is constructed big picture and once we're able to categorize the overall range shape of both players developing an overarching ev maximizing strategy for our actual hand becomes much simpler because when certain ranged morphologies match up against each other they will often play in specific predictable ways [Music] [Music] you", metadata={'source':

[Document(page_content="if you're interested in poker strategy undoubtedly you've heard about an unbeatable style of play known as Game Theory optimal or GTO for short but if you're new to GTO you've likely been confused by all the fancy terms and complicated programs and charts they're often used when discussing this topic so in this video we're going to outline in a very simple way how virtually every single GTO strategy is constructed we should start out by highlighting the sole and solitary goal of all GTO strategies which is to maximize chips GTO is simply a scientific method to do just that it focuses on choosing the action for each hand in each scenario that is most likely to win the most chips so what does that mean as a practical matter well to make things a bit easier to digest let's categorize the types of hands you may get in poker as strong medium or weak and start with our strongest hands which will often include things like full houses flushes straights sets two pairs over Pairs and strong top pairs the primary source of winning chips and poker is by playing large pots when we have hands like these and so when we have a strong hand we'll often want to bet or raise over multiple streets however if we only bet and raise our strong hands at some point Discerning opponents will stop calling us with worse right in a live environment we've all played against old man coffee that has a five percent v-pip and only shows down with Aces kings queens and Ace King and we quickly learn to avoid this guy once he starts betting big and online figuring out if our opponents are only betting strong hands is even easier through the use of heads-up displays so in order to induce our opponents to call our bets when we're holding a strong hand we need to also sometimes bet with our weak hands also known as Bluffs and bluffing also has the extra potential benefit of getting our opponent to fold a better hand but if you've played poker for a while you've probably noticed that you will typically have a weak hand much more often than you'll have a strong hand this means that you can't just Bluff every time you're holding a weak hand or else you're discerning opponents will catch on to this and start taking stands by calling down lighter so the next question is how do you decide when to Bluff and when not to Bluff well you could just flip a coin and that strategy would probably actually be okay but there's an even better way you can differentiate between your weak hands by their specific characteristics or micro attributes this may include deciding to Bluff with a good draw which we refer to as incremental Equity but choosing not to Bluff with pure air for example on this turn We could decide to Bluff if we're holding Queen 10 of diamonds but choose to just give up if we're holding a several Hearts because we have a much higher chance to hit a big hand and win a big pot with the former due to its incremental Equity we can also choose to Bluff when our particular holding makes it more likely that villain will fold from a probability standpoint which we refer to as card removal so on this River we may choose to Bluff with Ace of Diamonds tennis clubs but choose to give up with Ace of Hearts tenor clubs because we're holding the ace of diamonds it makes it impossible for our opponents to have the nut flush which in turn increases the probability that we'll get a fold due to our hands card removal effects when you balance betting strong and weak hands in this way it puts villain in a predicament if he has the nuts then defending is easy but what about his medium hands such as second and lower Pairs and perhaps strong Ace highs if hero only bets strong hands then villain can comfortably just fold all his medium hands and if Hiro bets all his weekends villain can just comfortably call all his medium hands but if Hiro starts balancing his bets among strong and weak hands then villain is forced to call some medium hands and fold others if he doesn't then hero would be able to readjust by either under or over bluffing so how does villain decide which medium hands to call and which to fold well again he could just flip a coin but similar to the bluffing situation villain can improve his chances for calling or folding correctly by choosing hands that have positive incremental Equity or card removal properties for example facing an all-in shove for our tournament life we may decide to call with pocket fours but fold with 10 9 because holding the 10 reduces the probability that villain is holding a bluff like 10 7 10 8 Queen 10 or King 10 for example so now that we've talked about what hero should do with his strong and weak hands what about his medium hands well since hands in this category generally will have a decent but not great chance to be ahead of villain they generally do not want to play for a big pot and will often be comfortable checking down and just scooping what went into the middle pre-flop so these middling hands can often be played either way as a bet or check often depending on incremental Equity however since we just mentioned that our strong hands usually want to bet over multiple streets if we take a passive strategy only with our medium hands and the weak hands that we give up our Discerning opponents would know that when we check the likelihood of us holding a strong hand is zero or very low and he could leverage this information to apply maximum pressure against us making our lives miserable so to protect our passive lines we can start to also play passively with some of our strong hands also known as slow playing or trapping which sometimes also has a benefit of allowing our opponents to make a hand he likes on later streets whereas if we just bet he might just fold so how do we determine which strong hands to bet and which strong hands to slow play with again we could just flip a coin but even better we could choose to slow play our hands that one don't need much protection and or two that block villains calling range so for example we may decide to see bet with pocket Jacks but check pocket aces because Jax could benefit from protection from over cards on turns and rivers whereas Aces do not need the same protection on this dry board the villain likely did not connect with or In this River scenario we may decide to slow play pocket kings but bet pocket fives because holding two kings makes it much less likely that villain has top pair or in other words our hand block top pair which is a calling hand whereas a pair of fives is not and that is about it what we've just described in a nutshell is essentially how every single GTO strategy is constructed it doesn't matter if it's Heads Up full ring MTT or Cache GTO is mainly about maximizing our chips by balancing our strong medium and weak hands in a way that makes our Holdings and strategies very disguised and difficult if not impossible to take advantage of and the key in terms of a practical application of GTO all comes down to combo selection knowing which hands to fit within which bucket depending on its specific characteristics but before we conclude this video we should note a few caveats about GTO first notice how we discussed the need to balance our range in the context of facing a Discerning opponent in contrast if your opponent is not paying attention to what you're doing then you can usually throw balance completely out the window which is referred to as exploitative play second even if your opponents are Discerning a practical real-life application of GTO doesn't require perfect balance it requires just enough balance so that your strategies are not face up quote unquote true GTO strategies are calculated by a computer playing a single hand against itself billions of times over but in real life you aren't playing the same hand billions of times against your opponents which means that even if you don't find balance in one particular hand it probably won't matter as long as you maintain some semblance of balance over the long run additionally when the computer plays against itself it is Clairvoyant that is it knows the exact probability of hands its opponent can have and how frequently it takes each action but your real-life opponents aren't Clairvoyant some may not have even graduated high school so you don't have to worry as much about maintaining a perfectly balanced strategy and finally although the overall premise of GTO is relatively simple and straightforward the execution of it is not knowing how to optimally balance your strategy can be incredibly difficult as it will be impacted by numerous factors such as the player's previous actions board cards the stack to pot ratio and position and that's why you'll sometimes see 30 minute long videos going over a single hand on this channel in this video we only briefly touched upon how to rationally differentiate between the weak hands we Bluff versus the weekends we give up or the medium hands we call versus fold or the strong hands we bet versus trap the reality is that there's a whole world of complexity that goes into making these decisions to

[Document(page_content="in our last video we described at a very high level how GTO strategies are constructed in this video we will focus on how Theory deals specifically with one of the most important and difficult aspects of Poker bluffing so to start off recall that in our last video we mentioned that in any given scenario usually you can't just Bluff your weak hands 100 of the time because you'll end up bluffing way too much so you need to be selective about when you Bluff by choosing combos based on their specific characteristics you could think of this as a two-step process first you consider how often you should be bluffing in a particular spot and then you decide whether to choose your specific hand to Bluff with based on a consideration of probabilities the first step of this process is generally driven by two primary questions which player is more likely to have the strongest hand and does villain have a high likelihood of holding a weekend the player who has the higher probability of holding the strongest hand is more likely to get folds with his Bluffs and if villain has a high likelihood of holding a weak hand he's more likely to fold when facing a bet so in other words the answers to these questions determine how often we should be bluffing overall in a given spot to explain further let's take a look at an example let's say that we're on button holding Jack Knight of diamonds and we raise pre-flop and the big blind calls the Flop comes King seven Deuce rainbow what should the big blind do well as mentioned the first part of our two-step process is to consider how often we should be bluffing which is determined primarily by who is more likely to hold the strongest hand and what the likelihood is of Dylan holding a weak hand if we can use Game Theory programs to help train our ability to answer both of these questions for those unfamiliar what you're looking at is a GTO program which tells us for a given scenario how each player should play all of his possible hands to maximize chips across all possible runouts and actions of the players in this particular case we're looking at the GTO strategy for the big blind on the Flop on the left we have a graphical depiction of all the possible hands the big blind is likely to have based on his prior actions also known as his range and on the right are all the hands the button is likely to have based on his prior actions so for example since the button raised pre-flop it's very possible that he has a hand like pocket aces or Ace King but it's unlikely he raised with a hand like seven Deuce off and a hand like Jack Adolf is probably somewhere on the borderline which is why this cell is only partially shaded because the probability of the button raising with this particular hand pre-flop is not quite 100 and on the flip side because the big blind simply called the Rays pre-flop it's unlikely that he has a hand like Aces or Ace King but very likely he has a hand like pocket fours So based on this which player is more likely to hold the strongest hand well right below these grids are bar charts which categorize all the possible hands from above into classes by their strength so in this case the button has a higher probability of holding a set two pair over pair and top pair and when the opponent is much more likely to hold the strongest hand particularly when we're out of position playing passively overall will usually be warranted which is graphically depicted by this last row this row shows how often the big blind should be taking each possible action in this scenario so in other words in this spot button versus big blind in a single raised pot on a king seven Deuce rainbow board regardless of the big blind's specific holding he should be checking 100 of the time now let's move on to the button's decision after the big blind checks as we just established the button has a much higher likelihood of holding the strongest hand what about the likelihood of the big blind holding a weak hand well it's significant the big blind has an over 40 percent chance of holding a hand that is weaker than ace high the combined effects of these two Dynamics means that the buttons should be leveraging this probabilistic advantage to play very aggressively in this case betting nearly 100 of the time including with virtually all bluffing candidates now let's assume that the button bets small here the big blind calls and the turn is the Queen of Diamonds and the big line checks again now we're looking at the hands both players are likely to have on the turn based on the pre-flop and flop action and at each and every decision point we start our analysis all over again so who is more likely to hold the strongest hand well it's still likely to be the button because he's more likely as the pre-flop aggressor to hold Aces kings queens and king queen both suited in an off suit but as to the likelihood of the big blind holding a weak hand the answer has significantly changed from the flop because the big line called the buttons flatbed it means that the likelihood of him holding complete trash on the turn is much lower because he should have folded most of his air on the Flop accordingly overall the frequency of how often the button should continue barreling on this turn is also much lower which means we now need to move on to the next stage of our analysis to determine whether we should Bluff our specific hand but before we do that let's pause for a moment to sum up the first stage of our bluffing analysis by creating a general heuristic if and a given spot the opponent is much more likely to hold the strongest hand you can usually check most or all the time particularly when out of position but if you are much more likely to hold the strongest hand and your opponent is very likely to hold a weak hand you can usually bet slash Bluff most of the time in most other scenarios such as when it's unclear who's likely to have the strongest hand or when villain is not very likely to have a weak hand hero will generally want to bet slash Bluff some of the time and check some of the time and in that case the next step of our analysis is to determine whether to Bluff our specific holding based on its specific characteristics and there are three primary factors that should be influencing this decision from a GTO perspective one Showdown value two incremental equity and three card removal Showdown value generally refers to the likelihood of our holding winning the pot assuming that the game ends immediately so a flush has a higher Showdown value than a pair and a pair has higher Showdown value than ace high and ace high AI has higher Showdown value than King High and so on and so forth generally speaking the lower The Showdown value our hand has the more inclined we should be to Bluff it we call that in our last video we mentioned that GTO Soul function is to take the actions that will maximize chips on average when deciding between betting and checking the lower The Showdown value of our hand the lower the amount of chips will likely win by playing passively through checking which in turn means that in order for bluffing to be the action that wins the most chips the threshold will be relatively low for example if we look at the frequency of betting represented by red orange and yellow compared to the frequency of checking represented by Green there's a distinct pattern that emerges among the various hand classes we're likely to hold in this spot the classes of hands that bet most often are the strongest hands which is no surprise and our weakest hands with the lowest Showdown value these hands in the middle are predominantly checking this is due in part to the fact that the number of chips these middling hands can win by playing passively to Showdown is higher relative to the number of chips the weakest hands can win by playing passively to Showdown for example the average number of chips a hand like Jack 4 of Hearts is expected to win by checking is only 0.6 big blinds whereas the average number of chips a hand like pocket nines is expected to win is much higher 5.3 big blinds this means that the threshold for betting to be the play that is likely to win the most chips is much higher for pocket lines than it is for Jack four of hearts or in other words bluffing with Jack four of Hearts only needs to win us chips a small amount of the time to be the play that maximizes our chips on average now let's talk about our second Factor incremental equity which generally refers to the qualities of a hand that make it more likely to make a stronger hand on a later Street this can be in the form of a draw to a flush or straight or to a lesser extent a draw to a strong pair two pair or trips so if we isolate our weakest hands we see that a pattern also emerges with respect to the buttons likely hands that have a draw and that don't have a draw hands with a draw are bet with much higher frequency proportionally compared to hands without a draw and the type of draw also influences bluffing frequency based on the strength of the draw with combo draws betting nearly 100 of the time and cut shots betting at a much lower frequency and as for the last Factor card removal Let's Take It To The River where incremental Equity is no longer relevant since as a general matter incremental Equity is more important than card removal because the former Alters the likelihood to win much more significantly than the latter so let's assume that on the turn we BET our Jack Knight of diamonds with a combo draw the big one called and the river is a three of Spades the big blind checks what do we do well this card is a brick as it doesn't really change much in terms of which player is more likely to hold the strongest hand so let's skip right to the second stage of our analysis with no further streets to come the only relevant factors are Showdown value in card removal as for Showdown value we see a similar pattern to the turn where the hands in the middle are mostly checked and Bluffs are primarily coming from the weakest hands however if we look at the GTO recommendation for our particular hand Jack nine of diamonds we see that it is to check 100 of the time so why is this well it all comes down to card removal as you may recall from our last video card removal refers to the fact that when we are holding a particular card it makes it impossible for our opponent to hold the same card which changes to the likelihood of whether our opponent is holding a stronger or weaker hand in the case of bluffing we want to select combos to Bluff with that increase the probability that our opponent is holding a weaker hand so in this case let's think about the most likely hands that the big blind could have called bets pre-flop on the Flop and on the turn but would likely fold on the river one likely hand would be a sacks of diamonds which may have floated the small bet on the Flop and turn the nut flush draw other possible hands could be ace Jack or Ace 10 that had a draw to the nuts on the turn or Jack 10 particularly with the backdoor flush drum having missed their flush and straight draws a third Barrel by the button would likely cause villain to fold these types of hands in this spot so with that in mind in the button shoes from a card removal perspective we don't want to be holding a card that prevents or blocks our opponent from holding one of these busted draws and our combo Jack nine of diamonds makes it impossible for villain to hold Ace nine of diamonds and some combos of Ace Jack and Jack 10 which in turn means are holding lowers the probability that villain has a hand that will fold and therefore it is not a good candidate to Bluff with a better candidate would be something like 10 9 of Hearts which doesn't block the big blind's diamond drawings and only blocks some ACE 10 and Jack 10 Combos and this process of differentiating and prioritizing similarly situated hands based on their specific characteristics is essentially how all close theoretically driven decisions are made and the best players in the world are the ones that can accurately assess each player's range and perform this type of analysis quickly but knowing which hands are better bluffing candidates compared to others is only part of the equation we also need to know where to draw the line between the types of hands we Bluff with versus check do we Bluff our top 10 percent of bluffing candidates top 50 top 75 to answer this question we need to bring things full circle and revisit our first stage of analysis which tells us how aggressive we should be overall so to frame our bluffing analysis as an overarching heuristic in every single situation where you're considering whether or not to Bluff you should first think about which player is more likely to be holding the strongest hand and the likelihood of villain holding a weak hand to determine your overall level of aggressiveness and then unless you're bluffing 100 of time or zero percent of the time you should prioritize choosing to Bluff hands that have lower Showdown value and that have some form of incremental equity and or that have a higher probability of causing villain to fold due to card removal to draw an analogy you could think of the first step of this process as determining the size of your bedding slash bluffing bucket in certain scenarios this bucket will be very big and in other scenarios the bucket will be very small usually it will be somewhere in between and then in the next step you fill up this bucket in order of the hands that have the best specific characteristics for bluffing in other words the threshold for which of your bluffing candidates make the cut off to Bluff will be heavily impacted by how big your bluffing bucket is overall if the bucket is Big you can usually Bluff with both strong and weaker bluffing candidates but if the bucket is small you should generally be more selective with the hands you Bluff with and prioritize your strongest bluffing candidates so for example let's go back to the turn but instead of the turn being the Queen of Diamonds let's say it's the deuce of diamonds in this case from our first stage of analysis it's not so clear that the button has the higher probability of holding the strongest hand and because in part it's much more likely that the big blind is holding a deuce as a pre-flop caller and with the big line much more likely to have trips it diminishes the strength of many of the buttons value combos which in turn means that we can't Bluff as much because our Bluffs need to be correlated to our value beds for purposes of balance accordingly on this turn the bedding slash bluffing bucket for the button is going to be significantly smaller compared to the queen turn which means that the threshold for the quality of hands that we will want to Bluff with generally should be higher so in this case maybe we decide to only Bluff our strongest flush draws but not our weaker ones even though we don't have any straight draws to pull from and what happens if the turn is Deuce of Hearts instead of the deuce of diamonds well this card is for the same reasons more favorable to villain so our overall level of aggression should be similarly depressed but here we have no draws available does it mean that we don't Bluff no in GTO if we have any value bets we must also have love so the fact that we don't have great bluffing hands just means that we need to dig down even deeper on our list of possible bluffing candidates this time relying principally on card removal so in this case maybe for example we choose to Bluff with a hand like a six of Hearts because we would not be blocking a hand that the big blind may have floated the Flop with against the small bet like 9 6 or 8-5 a space which had the double back doors now before we end this video we should note that the factors we just discussed aren't the only ones to consider when bluffing and therefore you will find that sometimes the GTO strategies produced by solvers will not neatly fit within our heuristics for example GTO will often spread out its Bluffs among many different types of hands instead of allocating Bluffs linearly based solely on incremental Equity because doing this provides better board coverage allowing hero to make a strong hand no matter how the run out goes also GTO May sometimes prioritize bluffing hands with lower incremental Equity over our hands with higher incremental Equity use usually when there's a significant risk of villain raising but for those that are new to GTO it probably isn't wise to get too caught up in these exceptions especially if you're playing live or at lower to Mid Stakes remember our real life opponents aren't Clairvoyant like solvers and we aren't playing the same hand against then billions of times over so the same considerations that the computer must take into account when devising its strategies aren't going to be as important against most of our real-life opponents the most important factors that you should be considering in all blocking scenarios are the ones we highlighted in this video foreign", metadata={'source': 'e-W3brG_KcA', 'title': 'How To Bluff | GTO Primers',

[Document(page_content="in the first two videos of this GTO primer series we provided a high level overview of how GTO strategies are constructed in a process oriented way to determine whether or not to Bluff in this video we will discuss how Game Theory approaches the way most of the money is made in poker value betting specifically we will be focusing on close bet or check decisions if you have the nuts deciding to bet is usually a no-brainer putting aside slow playing which we will discuss in a later video but a lot of money can be won or Lost based on close value-being decisions which makes having a system to rationally decide these types of spots important fortunately because in GTO plus need to mirror value bets for purposes of balance the same framework we use to determine our Bluffs can also be used to determine our value bets that is first we estimate how often we should be value betting in a particular spot and then we decide whether to choose our specific hand value bet based on a consideration of probabilities and the first step of this process is identity article to the first step of our bluffing analysis where we ask two questions which player is more likely to have the strongest hand and does villain have a high likelihood of holding a very weak hand which informs our overall level of aggression as well as our predominant bed sizing to explain further let's go back to the hand we analyzed in our bluffing video here we're in a six Max 100 big blind game the button opens and the big blind calls but instead the button holding Jack 9 let's say we're holding King eight of hearts and the Flop is King seven Deuce rainbow as we discussed in the last video If in a given spot the opponent is much more likely to hold the strongest hand you can usually check most or all the time particularly when out of position so in this case even if the big blind is holding something very strong like pocket Deuces he should check his entire range however if you are much more likely to hold the strongest hand and your opponent is very likely to hold a weak hand you can usually bet slash Bluff most of the time using a small sizing so after the big blind checks because the button as the pre-flop caller is more likely to hold the strongest hand and the big blind has a high probability of holding a weak hand the button in theory should be playing very aggressively even if the button is actually holding something mediocre like pocket threes this isn't really a value bet it's more of a protection bet but the point remains in this situation you don't really have to worry about whether your hand is strong enough to bet you can just fire with the entire range now let's assume that the button bets small here the big blind calls and the turn is the Queen of Diamonds and the big blind checks again in this case although the button is still likely to hold the strongest hand the big blind is no longer likely to hold a very weak hand because in theory he should have folded most of his weak hands on the Flop so just like our bluffing analysis in this scenario the button will want to Value bet some hands and check others but how is this decision made well the same three factors that influence close bluffing decisions also influence close betting decisions Showdown value incremental equity and card removal generally speaking the higher The Showdown value our hand has the more inclined we should be to Value bet it we assess Showdown value by estimating where our hand ranks relative to villain's Equity distribution and this process without a doubt is the single most critical factor that drives value-betting decisions as a general heuristic in order to Value bet any hand it needs to be ahead of more than 50 percent of Dylan's defending range this is because we need the probability of villain calling with a weaker hand to be high enough to produce positive EV for our bet as a practical matter one way to determine this is to Simply imagine in your mind the types of hands a villain is likely to have that are weaker but strong enough to call the more hands you can think of the more likely it is that you should value bet so going back to our example because we've determined that the button is more likely to hold the strongest hand but villain is not very likely to hold a weekend we know that using a small bet size probably won't make much sense this is because we need need to use a sizing that gives our Bluffs effective fold leverage and against a range that is not likely to have a very weak hand it means that in order to induce folds we need to size up in this case with the big blind very likely to hold a decently strong hand like a top middle or weak pair or straight or flush draw the solver likes to bet very big 150 percent of the pot so with that in mind what are the likely hands that the big line can call with well we will discuss Bluff catching decisions in a future video but it's probably safe to assume that the primary threshold for where most would call a very large bed like this is around top pairs plus which probably means that if we need to be ahead of more than half of villain's defending range the bottom threshold of our betting range will likely be top pair at a minimum now the big one could also call with some weaker hands perhaps some strong Queen X combos some lower pairs that also have a draw and stronger combo and flush draws but probably not enough of these hands will call against this bed size towards value betting with less than top pair as a general matter so a very simplified strategy that we can Implement here would be to just continue betting with all top pairs plus while at the same time checking weaker made hands but we can refine this strategy even further by getting a bit more granular for example is King 3 really strong enough to over bet in this spot according to the machine no it's not and if you've played for a while intuitively this seems correct so how do we decide where to draw the line when it comes to our top pairs well that's where our next two factors come into play and our last video our primary focus when it came to incremental Equity were draws and we do see that if we isolate our lower pairs hands that also have a flush draw do bet some percentage of the time however in this case since the King on the board is the King of Diamonds we don't have any top pairs that also have a draw so instead we'll look to a different lesser form of incremental Equity to differentiate our combos our kicker if we isolate our top pair is we see a pretty clear pattern emerge where generally speaking the stronger the kicker the more aggressive the solver is with its top pairs with top top betting nearly 100 of the time and these top pairs with lower kickers checking most of the time the reason for this discrepancy is because if we assume that the most prominent calling region of villain's range is top pair then the kicker will make a huge difference in terms of whether our bet is winning or losing EV if we have an ace kicker it means that there's a very good possibility that we will be dominating our opponent and will be able to stack him by the river but if our kicker is weak then there's a good chance that we're just throwing good money after bad another heuristic that may be helpful in this regard is whether we feel like our hand is strong enough to stack off with assuming a clean run out if it clearly is then we should be more inclined to continue the barrel so that the stack sizes on the river are such that we can get all in with a reasonable bet however if it's not so clear that our hand is strong enough to play for Stacks checking will often be a viable option where perhaps we can check the turn and then bet the river or we can check the turn and allow the opponent to Bluff the river for us to hammer this point home let's assume that the button bet big the big blind called the river is a three of Spades and the big blind checks again whenever we're making a decision we start our analysis all over in terms of who is more likely to hold the strongest hand is still likely to be the button who was the pre-flop aggressor and barreled twice whereas the big blind has played passively to this point with calls and no raises however given the big blinds calls it's unlikely his hand is very weak which means the button won't be betting his entire range here so let's move on to the next step where the goal is to determine where our hand fits among our opponent's Equity distribution Although our hand was ahead of the vast majority of the big lines range on the Flop when the big blind called bets on both the Flop and turn it lowered the probability of the big blind holding a weak hand which in turn decreased the number of hands R king 8 is ahead of on the river which from a probability standpoint increase the likelihood our hand is behind villain accordingly Although our hands started out firmly as red with high equity on the Flop here now on the river it's orange with decent Equity but not quite strong enough relative to the big one's Equity distribution to fire another barrel and where are hand ranks and villains Equity distribution isn't only impacted by hands and villains range that drop off when he calls it can also be negatively impacted by stronger hands that are added to the top of villain's Equity distribution when he makes a draw so for example let's say that instead of the three of Spades which is pretty much a brick the river is the five of diamonds even though some of the buttons stronger top pairs fired a third Barrel on the three of Spades turn on this five of diamonds turn almost no top pairs bet because the equity of this entire class has been diminished by the potential flushes in the big blinds range in this case not only is our hand ahead of a smaller portion of buildings Equity distribution because the big blind should have folded many of his weakest hands on the Flop and turn our hand is now behind a greater portion of villain's Equity distribution because it's very possible that the big blind has made a flush this crams down the strength of our hand which is now represented by yellow with mediocre Equity that being said we do see a tiny sliver of top pairs that fire a third Barrel which brings us to our last Factor card removal according to the solver there's exactly one kind of top pair that can bet on this River top pair with top kicker that also has a diamond why because holding the ace of diamonds makes it significantly less likely that the big blind has a flush this is especially true since we bet so large on the turn which means that in theory the big blind should have folded some of his weaker flush draws similarly we see that Aces with the Ace of Diamond are virtually all betting but Aces without a diamond are checking essentially What's Happening Here is that by lowering the probability or blocking the big blind from having a flush it it incrementally decreases the number of hands the big blind is likely to have that are ahead of the button's hand which in turn slightly improves its rank vis-a-vis villains Equity distribution and the flip side is also true if we're holding a car that lowers the probability or blocks the big blind from holding a calling hand that is weaker it would slightly lower the rank of the button's hand vis-a-vis villains Equity distribution for example let's say that the river is the Ten of diamonds instead of the five of diamonds in this case not only is it possible that the big blind has made a flush that pushes our top pairs down the equity distribution now it's also possible that the big one has made a straight which pushes down our top pairs even further here we see that virtually no top pairs or repairs or even two pairs bet even with the ace of diamonds blocker instead the threshold for Value bending has moved up to a set but interestingly we see that among our sets pocket Deuces and pocket sevens basically bet all the time whereas pocket Queens which are stronger only that some of the time so why is this well this is a function of card removal in this case the queen blocks some of the potential Bluff catchers that the big blind may call with such as Queen Jack and queen nine that blocks our straights or in other words the buttons Queens remove some of the weaker portion of the big blind's Equity distribution which in turn very slightly decreases the strength of this hand but holding pocket sevens or pocket Deuces would have little to no impact on the big blinds Equity distribution from a probability standpoint so to sum things up when facing a close value-baying decision we should first assess how aggressive we want to be overall and our predominant sizing by estimating who is more likely to hold the strongest hand and whether villain is likely to hold a very weak hand then assuming that we aren't betting all or none of our range we then rank where our hand fits relative to villain's Equity distribution and if the decision seems close we combo select by focusing on incremental equity and card removal so that is is a video for today thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced [Music]", metadata={'source': 'i_tD83peBBk', 'title': 'How To Value Bet | GTO Primer', 'description':

[Document(page_content="[Music] foreign ly we reviewed one of the best folds in poker history where Doug Polk was able to get away from a flop straight versus Phil hellmuth's higher straight today we'll be reviewing what perhaps is the worst fold in poker history not too surprisingly this hand comes from the Hustler Casino live stream where players are cold calling 10 big blind raises with eight seven off and Jack nine off let's go let's go five-way action heading to the flop picture I have heard Nick has Ace key again this time he has two overs in a gutter Mike X is open-ended what else we got going on Patrick's got a gutter ball dark net is gonna bet two thousand with craps on Queen 10-6 into four opponents gonna call Patrick's out of there have you had enough Mike Epps no he's just gonna call guess who has the best hand cream Dark Knight who gets this kind of value with threes Dark Knight uh oh Bertucci turns Broadway with the nut flush draw get the Dark Knight could slow down he can yeah 4400 Mike X now has a pair still open-ended has a flush draw Andy trying dead it makes a good fold can The Dark Knight get away from these two red threes I don't know if I could fold these threes four four Forty Four Hundred can't blame him for continuing here you beat twos in case Nick has those you got this that's 4 400. buttons it just has like that much right here okay I disagree I think in this instance you want to tell them great 15 large wow [Applause] Nick nods his head he's gonna draw to the nuts in case he's behind he's not he just needs to fade his cards somehow falling off the table turn Broadway [Applause] a little redraw to the nut flush you guys had 14 shots of tequila I think put in the call and then call the river fold fold wait what nice hand thank you oh no now in all seriousness I don't think this is actually the worst fold in poker history although it is pretty bad obviously from the comfort of our homes we can see that puffy jacket was just making a horrendous Bluff but if we try to put ourselves in Nick's shoes it is possible to come up with a plausible explanation for his play I.E exploitation so pre-flop under the gun limps and Dark Knight over limped Nick then raised large two other players called and then the limpers called at this point what did Dark Knight's range look like well although ranging a live opponent can be extremely difficult it's probably safe to assume that he would do this primarily with hands like lower pocket pairs as he was holding and a variety of suited combos maybe something like this on the Flop Dark Knight then dunks out into four other players with a relatively large 78 pot bet so what are some plausible hands they could be doing this with perhaps something like a random Queen X that wants protection or some sort of draw like King Jack Jack nine or a flush drum the turn is a jack of clubs Dark Knight checks Bertucci bets a bit over half pot and then Dark Knight raises 3.4 x and Nick folds so what on Earth was Nick thinking here well he likely assumed that the probability of Dark Knight bluffing here was relatively low and that his line was probably value heavy with flushes if true from a purely exploitative standpoint it's conceivable that this fold could be profitable in the long run even though it was wrong in this particular instance and made him look like a fool think about what we perceived Dark Knights likely range to be on the Flop something like this with mostly Queen X straight and flush draws of this range on the turn we can reasonably carve out Queen X since it's not really strong enough to raise here given the action and the board even if it made two pair so what about straights if you thought that Dark Knight was Raising for value with a straight then calling with the nuts trade would appear to be a no-brainer but that intuitively seems unlikely given the prior action and the fact that the flush came in on the turn which Nick should have plenty of in his range also Nick is holding a king which potentially blocks some of Dark Knight straights like King Nine of Spades perhaps and the Jack likely pairs some of his other straight draws so if you assume that Dark Knight likely has a flush here and doesn't have enough Bluffs then Nick's straight even with the nut flush redraw is a mere Bluff catcher now if it sounds like we're grasping for straws with this rationalization it's because we are and at the end of the day this is just a bad fold but it is a good example of the perilous dangers of exploitative play of course there are plenty of players who have had very successful careers playing predominantly exploitatively so this isn't to say that it doesn't work but if you were to pull the bottom 50th percentile of all poker players in the world most likely 100 of them would think that GTO is a type of car in other words although playing exploitatively has a high ceiling the floor is a bottomless pit and this is primarily due to two significant flaws for one when you attempt to exploit someone by definition you you open yourself up to being counter exploited now some downplay this risk by arguing that it doesn't matter if you overfold in a specific spot because you'll never encounter it again while that may be true this dismissal ignores the risk of overfolding in the aggregate which can be easily identified and exploited you see most imbalanced players don't consciously make a decision to be imbalanced what's happening is that there is a systemic flaw in their decision-making framework that causes them to make blunders in individual spots and because this issue is systemic the same error is then repeated in multiple spots over a span of time which can be picked up on so for example let's say that Dark Knight actually had a flush in this spot which he certainly could have played the same way in which case Nick would have looked like a genius with his tight fold the problem however is that if you continue to make tight fold after tight fold and your opponents had the cognitive ability to detect patterns which immediately may not be the case in these streams that nituchi could easily be taken advantage of by over bluffers over the long run furthermore the only way exploitative play is profitable is when your specific assumptions about how villain is playing are correct so in this case we did our best to put ourselves in Nick's shoes to try to understand why he made the play that he did this was on the basis of various assumptions which at first glance seemed to be reasonable however the reality is that no two humans are alike and it is impossible to know with any certainty what they are exactly thinking at the felt especially if you haven't played many hands with them at best we can only make educated guesses about what our opponents are doing what we will often be wrong especially when your opponents smoke a lot of crack in contrast one of the beautiful aspects of game theory is that it doesn't require you to know anything about your opponent's specific strategy you can employ the exact same GTO strategy again someone that's very tight or someone that's very loose and that strategy will be effective regardless because by definition it is unexploitable so in this case let's say that we've never played against Dark Knight before so we have no idea what his Tendencies are if we employ a GTO based strategy against him at least until we're able to recognize a leak in his game it will safeguard us from punting off chips left and right if Dark Knight is a loose and aggressive player that's over bluffing Bluff catching with some hands will protect us from being run over and if Dark Knight is a tight player that never makes this sort of bluff only allocating calls to our best Bluff catchers and folding the rest will prevent us from Uber calling and in this case the nut straight which beats all of villains Bluffs with the Ace of clubs which blocks the nut flush and gives us a chance to draw ahead if villain is not bluffing will be our number one Bluff catching candidate to call with now we should note that a GTO strategy against an imbalanced player will not be the most profitable one but although we know that everyone is imbalanced it's hard to know immediately the direction of that imbalance Additionally the floor for someone well versed in Game Theory will be significantly higher than someone that's trying to play with a Max exploit style and he will typically be much more difficult to play against because balance inherently disguises your strategies furthermore just because you understand Game Theory it doesn't mean that you can't exploit but if you only know how to exploit then you won't have anything to fall back upon when you don't know how your opponent plays which will often be the case so that is a video for today thanks for watching and until next time [Music] see you [Applause] [Music] [Music]",

[Document(page_content="foreign [Applause] [Music] in our last video we analyzed one of the worst folds in the history of mankind and some in the peanut gallery question why we were even mentioning game theory in a hand where people were cold calling 10 big blind raises with total gutter trash if none of the players even knows what a solver is isn't trying to apply GTO to assess their play utterly useless well the notion that game theory can't or shouldn't be applied in certain scenarios is a common misconception which we will attempt to disabuse in this video since Game Theory optimal is not a technical term of art much of the disagreement in regards to the whole exploitative versus GTO debate is simply definitional where people end up just talking past each other you see broadly speaking there are two primary schools of thought when it comes to GTO probably the most common way people think of and refer to GTO is that it is whatever the solver says it is in other words the GTO strategy for a particular scenario is the Nash equilibrium output calculated by the solver using the parameters of that scenario as the input we will refer to this as strict GTO those that subscribe to this school of thought tend to learn GTO mainly through memorization they look up or drill specific scenarios and then mimic the solver's outputs when they encounter the same or similar situations the other school of thought which we will refer to as conceptual GTO doesn't rely as much on precise memorization but rather focuses on utilizing principles from Game Theory as guideposts to help reason their way through strategic decisions this latter approach is the one that we take on this channel but this is not to say that it is superior to strict GTO each has its place strict GTO is most effective at high stakes online where a greater percentage of the player pool studies using solvers against an opponent that is playing a GTO based style the strategy that will maximize EV will also be based on the Nash equilibrium and it's often the player that does more detailed solver work that will have the advantage however against an opponent that is imbalanced a strategy based on a solver output will not be profit maximizing and sometimes may not even make sense but one can still employ Game Theory principles against an imbalanced opponent to maximize his EV to explain further we're going to review another hand from Hustler Casino Live where most people have less balance than Sean deeb's diet and this particular game involves a lineup with even a lower level of competence than the gaggle of degenerates from the last video social media influencers specifically this hand is between chess master Alexandra botez and Bryce Hall who I had never heard of before but apparently he makes Dance videos on an application called tick tock foreign [Applause] you raise Matthew Harrington in the chat says running it twice shouldn't even be allowed well it's all about the players if the players want to do it it's about them you know but if you hate running it twice check out Max Payne Mondays each and every Monday at 5 pm again with the clips no running it twice needling slow rolls encouraged top two for Alex I'll check okay in there [Applause] so Bryce opens under the gun and Alexandra cool calls in the cut off the Flop is Ace King 4 and Bryce checks Alexandra bet small and Bryce calls Bryce's check with the underpear seems perfectly fine what about Alexandra small bet can we analyze this from a conceptual GTO perspective well although there are many different principles that impact an EV maximizing strategy perhaps the two most important ones that should be considered in almost all scenarios are balance and probabilities let's talk about the latter first since in poker our opponent's cards are hidden in order to craft a rational strategy we can't just assume that our opponent has one specific hand instead we need to consider a probability distribution of hands that our opponent is likely to have based on prior actions which always starts pre-flop in this case Bryce opened an early position with a gigantic Rave 20x the big blind now I didn't watch this whole stream because I want to retain my brain cells so I'm not sure what the customary opening size is in this game but generally the larger you raise the stronger your range needs to be perhaps Bryce uses some super sophisticated split sizing technique where he raises larger with strong but vulnerable hands like pocket AIDS and then he uses smaller sizings with nutted hands like pocket aces but for purposes of our analysis we're going to utilize this 200 big blind 9 max range as a rough starting point now as mentioned theoretically the opening range for a 20x raise should be much tighter than the opening range for a 3X rays but these guys are also playing very loose so perhaps these variables offset each other additionally since we're analyzing this hand from a conceptual GTO standpoint and not a strict one having very precise ranges isn't overly critical we'll be using these Solutions primarily as a visual cue of the types of combos that the players might be holding and this seems somewhat reasonable so the next question is how did Bryce's flop check impact his pre-flop range well intuitively you would expect Bryce to continue betting with many of his strongest hands that want to start growing the pot given that the players are relatively deep and since as we mentioned his range should be relatively strong and interact well with this board it would also be safe to assume that if you're holding something relatively weak like Queen Jack or queen 10 suited he would try to leverage his strong range on this Ace King Board to Bluff this means that when Bryce decided to check instead of bet the probability of him holding something very strong or something very weak should decrease which by process of elimination means that the probability of him holding something middling should increase in the universe of conceptual GTO we call this a mid-heavy range and generally speaking the predominant bet size you'll want to use against a mid-heavy range is on the larger side a larger sizing gets more value for your strongest hands and applies the most fold equity for your weakest hands note however that when you use a large sizing it will usually mean that you must play in a more polarized fashion meaning you should generally only be betting with your strongest and weakest hands but in this case top two is certainly going to be strong enough to allocate to the big bet bucket and against the small bet that Alexandra actually used we see that Bryce's decision could go either way as a call or fold but if Alexandra had used the larger sizing this would have been just a fold which as we'll see ends up being consequential you got to be kidding me what a turn card what a turn card oh oh sure yeah what do you have wow wow twelve thousand dollar pot price one card away from doubling up a mess flop tube like a pair oh she did yeah bow touch looking for an ace or a king here nice job how much are you so since Bryce ended up with all the chips this Jam must have been the correct move right well not exactly this is what we refer to as results oriented thinking which is tempting to do in poker especially when you are raking in or losing a massive pot but this can lead to ingraining very bad habits just because you bet your paycheck on lucky number seven in roulette and win it doesn't mean that this is a winning strategy over time in poker individual results are essentially meaningless in the context of a lifetime of playing the game so it's critical to develop a solid foundational strategy that gives you the best chance to win over time and that is something conceptual GTO can help provide so in this case not surprisingly from a strict GTO standpoint betting here let alone shoving is even less rational than a tweet by prahlad Friedman but why is this the case well this is where the other fundamental principle of conceptual GTO comes into play balance recall what we said Bryce's checking range was mostly comprised of on the Flop middle strength hands like perhaps weaker Ace X King X and under pairs and even if Bryce was Savvy enough to slow play some nutted hands to protect his checking range like the solver many of those hands would have had an incentive to check Reyes Alexandra small bet to jump start growing the pot with the goal of getting Stacks in by the river this means that his likely range on the turn is even more mid-heavy than it was after his flop check and so the next logical question is what does this Aid of Spades change essentially this turn has no interaction with any part of Bryce's range except perhaps pocket eights and Ace 8. and given the sizing over 3x the pot including Ace 8 is a bit of a stretch especially if you think Alexandra regularly cold calls Ace King pre-flop and on the bluff side this eight doesn't bring in any new straight or flush draws although as mentioned the price could have raised pre-flop with something like Queen Jack or queen 10 suited if you decided not to Bluff those hands on the Flop donk jamming them on this turn doesn't really make any sense so basically what Bryce is saying here is I have exactly pocket eights it's really the only logical hand that can make this play now of course imputing logic to this sort of riffraff is dubious but when you're playing against an unknown villain you kind of have to assume some rationality to devise counter strategies against or else you're just clicking buttons so as a general matter in Bryce's shoes we want to avoid taking actions that only a very small number of hands in our range have an incentive to take because narrowing your range dramatically simply makes you easier to play against in this case although this bet ultimately worked out for Bryce because Alexandra happened to have top two if she just had a pair which was much more likely folding would have been relatively easy and Bryce would have lost out on many chips so how do you avoid playing face up like this through balance but when we say balance we don't mean perfect balance in accordance with a solver where we are mixing combo shows at the exact right frequencies using a randomizer as is the case with strict GTO we simply mean playing hands of different strength in similar ways just enough so as to disguise our strategies recall how we said that since villains cards are hidden we need to consider a probability distribution of hands that they could have well villain doesn't know our cards either so we want to take advantage of this fact by keeping as much of our range intact as possible through balance and the level of balance a person needs to effectively disguise his strategies will depend on the context in most live environments the level of balance you need when betting basically amounts to just sometimes showing up with value and sometimes showing up with Bluffs that would usually be enough to keep opponents honest and on their toes however if you're playing high stakes online against regs who have Huds that allow them to analyze your tendencies in all spots then the level of balance you will need will be much higher so as a practical matter how might one incorporate balance in this type of setting well one simple way to do it is by using range morphologies which we alluded to earlier as mentioned given Bryce's check a call on the Flop his range was likely mid-heavy and mid-heavy ranges tend to play passively because most of the range consists of mediocre hands that don't want to play a huge pot and would prefer just getting The Showdown and since the aid of spades on the turn doesn't really change anything Bryce's range should still be mid-heavy so in this scenario simply following the primary incentive of this morphology and checking all hands would be a very easy way to maintain some semblance of balance which ultimately disguises your strategy in contrast when you take a line that significantly deviates from your range's morphology a huge chunk of hands are Stripped Away providing less cover for your actual cards additionally although it's conceivable that Bryce could have had some strong hands here such as slow played Aces or Kings since this 8 doesn't significantly improve Bryce's range there's a good possibility that if Alexandra had something strong enough to bet on the Flop it is still strong enough to bet on the turn which would give Bryce the opportunity to check raise the same is also true of Alexandra's Bluffs now let's talk about Alexander's call what district GTO say about this spot absolutely nothing because Bryce's dong shove is simply not a thing there's no coherent Nash equilibrium response to a play that is utterly incoherent but conceptual GTO can still be applied as follows at the Baseline when facing any bet Game Theory suggests that you should call with any hand that you think beats villain's weakest value hand and then you should also call some hands that are slightly below this threshold called Bluff catchers and then you fold the rest in this case if you thought Bryce could be doing this with a slow played Ace King or perhaps something like Ace 8 then this would be a pure call but if you think he's only doing this with a set then Ace King despite being extremely strong is merely a bluff catcher which potentially could go either way and the amount of bluff catchers you need to call with will be heavily dictated by the size of the BET which in this case is huge so as a practical matter from a conceptual GTO standpoint Alex only needs to call a small fraction of the time and Ace King is perhaps her best Bluff catcher it beats all Bluffs it blocks Aces and kings and even against Bryce's AIDS it potentially can draw ahead to a better Full House now some of you may be thinking to yourself didn't we just say that Bryce's bed doesn't really make sense as a bluff well yes we did but for anyone that has played life before you know that sometimes people just lose their minds and do random nonsense which playing with just a modicum of balance will protect you against even if you aren't perfectly balanced taking a stand at least once in a while with a bluff catcher will let people know that you simply cannot be run over that all being said this particular situation is so unique with a massive donk over bed that only makes sense with one specific combo that dramatically overfolding here probably isn't a bad idea although as we mentioned in the last video you generally want a strategic framework that causes you to call with some Bluff catchers to avoid overfolding in the aggregate this situation is a bit of a one-of-one scenario that is very different from the hand we reviewed last time in that hand Nick was facing a check raise with the nut straight and a draw to the absolute nuts that would have beat 100 of villain's value also it was plausible to think of plenty more Bluffs that villain potentially could have had there such as a flush draw or perhaps a pair plus a straight draw and on top of all that villain was someone who called himself a dark knight and was dressed like an 80s rapper so although from a conceptual GTO standpoint whenever you face a bet you generally want to Bluff catch some of the time there are exceptions to every Rule and I think it would be reasonable to significantly overfold in this specific spot due to its absolute absurdity while at the same time ensuring that you are Bluff catching in more common scenarios over the long run to avoid being run over so that is the video for today thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced happy field I can grasp what is not real so I'll get my get memories [Music] and I remember in the in the museum daydreaming is it all that it seems or am I all the things [Music] foreign

[Document(page_content="[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] in our last video we reviewed a hand played by Magnus Carlson in a deep cash game where he looked like a natural making an epic hero call in this video we'll be reviewing a hand played by Magnus in an MTT with a bit of a different result that will serve as a current reminder that poker's complexities can humble even the most brilliant of Minds well so a pure freeze-out pure poker very rare especially in Europe but even very rare anywhere around the globe but this is how poker should be played and could be in a rough spot with forbrook waking up with the pocket rockets foreign with a lot more hands and Carlson does call oh my God Magnus Carlson here gets a dream pop of King eight nine what a dream for Magnus Carlson peeling off that three bet forberg leading out after three betting his Rockets now how is Carlson gonna approach this it's still even though it is a rainbow board that eight nine does connect with some of his opponents Holdings for a draw are we going to see a call or a race by the chess Legend Magnus Carlson will just call I like this a lot so we're in the early stages of the Norwegian poker championship and Magnus opens the cutoff with 8-8 with around 36 big blinds villain wakes up in the small blind with pocket aces Zoe three bets and Magnus calls all very standard the Flop is King 89 rainbow and Bill in C bets around 30 percent and Magnus calls so in this spot the pre-flop razor could choose one of two primary paths he could Target the weaker part of the pre-flop collar's range by betting small which allows him to fire with most or all of his range or alternatively the pre-flop razor could leverage his nut advantage and take a more polarized line targeting the middle part of the caller's range with a larger sizing with his strongest hands and Bluffs however in magnus's shoes there's really just one way to go here which is to slow play and this is largely influenced by the spr if we rerun the exact same sim but change the spr from less than two to over seven we see that the raising frequency increases significantly in the deeper Sim with more chips behind the win these nutted hands have a strong incentive to accelerate growing the pot whereas in the short spr Sim getting Stacks in with two streets to go and in position should not be too difficult you don't want your opponent to fold and the King of Spades on the turn improves Carlson further to a Full House for Burke however may actually slow down to some degree but he can never really be folding his Aces here not to somebody as smart as Carlson who could be floating and deciding what to do next but does check this slow down now it's going to be up the crossing to try to get more value out of this hand there are a couple cards on the river that can actually be Crossing not just the two Aces but the two remaining Kings would both get for Burke a full house but he doesn't know what four Burke has the turn pairs the king and four brothers size to slow down perhaps because he believes Magnus has many hands here that will want to Bluff or bet for protection however the Sauber generally prefers barreling here with Aces and with most of the range this king is actually a good card for the pre-flop aggressor because it improves the equity of his strong under pairs which he has an advantage in given that it is now less likely that the pre-flop caller has a king So hands like tens through Queens are certainly going to be strong enough to bet here especially with the short SBR as the threshold for stacking off decreases when the effective stack becomes smaller and having locked up the Full House magneticized to continue to slow play which is consistent with the solver strategy however if the players were deeper we see that this would be a pure bet to grow the part with just one street remaining but even if they put Fort Burke on an Ace King type of hand those cards would still apply but it said it's a queen of hearts on the river and Fort brick reaching for his chips betting 18 000 into a pot of forty two thousand what a Poker Face by Magnus Carlson looking a little troubled by that bet but expect them to come over the top obviously now he's losing to some King Queens as well so we'll see how he approaches it you shouldn't be concerned so much about the king 9 King a but those are possibilities as well but for wouldn't have been three betting those I don't believe he's been playing fairly close to the best and for him to be three betting king queen would have been out of character for Fort Burke as well so Carlson should still feel he has the best hand here he does just call though folks so the river is the queen of hearts and forberg decides to make a small blockish bet however the Sauber prefers shoving here which again is largely a function of the spr as there probably are enough weaker hands it magnets his range that can call given his passive line such as Queen X 9x and lower pocket Pairs and as for magnus's check back well there's really no two ways about it this is a massive blunder according to this Sim pocket eights is a pure shove and checking loses around 15 000 ships in EV so why on Earth did this Super Genius check now obviously we can't read magnus's mind but from his monologue in the last video he clearly understands the concept of thinking in ranges and so if I had to guess magnus's decision was the result of him falling prey to something that affects even Advanced players truncated targeting since when you're playing you don't have these nice little charts in front of you and your time is limited it's not really possible to consider all of the likely combos in villainous range so what often happens is people end up only focusing on a narrow portion of villain's range which causes their decision to end up being short-sighted so how do you avoid doing this well there are three tips which we'll offer that may be helpful to mitigate the effects of truncated targeting particularly for newer players first is using ranged morphologies which we mentioned in the last couple videos we've done a whole detailed video on morphologies but essentially involves fitting your opponent's range into one of four categories based on his prior actions and the bore texture when someone plays in a particular way it tends to skew his range distribution in a certain predictable Manner and there's usually an effective heuristic that you can apply to maximize your EV against these specific range shapes so in this case villain was the pre-flop aggressor in a three-bed pot on a relatively favorable board which likely made his range balanced with some strong some medium and some weak hands in contrast Magnus as the three bed caller likely had a bottom heavy range particularly on the rainbow board with a lot of complete whiffs and other low Equity hands and when in bounce range matches up with the bottom heavy range you'll often see a small bet with very high frequency as we saw in this case which means that forbergs range on the turn likely remained balanced however when forberg checked the turn that was either favorable or at a minimum neutral for him Magnus checked back and then forberg bet small in the river it likely rendered his range more mid-heavy as this rain shape tends to play passively with checks or small bets if villain was holding something very nutted he would have been more likely to bet on the turn and or bet larger on the river and even if Magnus was unsure of forberg's exact rain shape here one thing that was very clear was that it was not polarized which would be the only morphology that checking back a full house might conceivably make some sense against in select scenarios as a reminder a polarized range is usually created when one player takes the initiative and maintains it with large bets generally designed to get Stacks in by the river when a player takes this sort of line his range tends to become primarily comprised of the very strongest and weakest hands in other words a polarized range is largely missing mid-strength hands which generally do not want to play a big pot and it is this class of hands that typically Bluff catches so against the polarized range raising generally becomes less attractive because the opponent doesn't have many weaker hands that can call you run a higher risk of growing the pot and reopening the action against hands that are stronger and it's useless to try to extract more value from trash that will mostly just Auto fold now of course given the spr and the fact that he was out of position forberg definitely could have been slow playing with his line but poker is a game of probabilities and so you can't become fixated on the worst case scenario you have to make plays based on what is most likely and invoking range morphologies though not perfect can be a practical way to avoid truncated targeting since morphologies capture the probability distribution of the entire range not just one segment a second tip that may be useful in value-betting situations to help bring Clarity and cut through the confusion that can sometimes be caused by excessive range analysis or obsessing over micro details like blockers or Equity is to Simply ask yourself how much is your hand worth and then putting in bets and raises that grow the pot to that size and 30 big blinds deep with a relatively short spr absent extraordinary circumstances a full house is going to be worth all the chips in fact on the Flop magnus's soul and solitary Mission should have been to figure out the most efficient way to get Stacks in by the river regardless of almost any run out now understandably as a beginner it can be difficult to assess a hand's relative worth but one way to quickly build up this intuition is by using a GTO trainer because it will teach you objectively and measurably each hand's expected value you can also build this understanding by simply playing through trial and error but this route tends to be much less efficient due to the substantial role of variants in poker and the final tip to mitigate the effects of truncated targeting is to focus primarily on the region of villains range that runs counter to your natural tendencies so for example I'm naturally a risk-averse person so especially when I first started playing I had an intrinsic hesitance to pull the trigger on Bluffs and thin value beds so what I force myself to do when considering whether or not to Bluff a weak hand for example was instead of focusing on the boogeyman under the bed I.E better hands that villain can call with I would focus on billions hands that are better that are likely to fold the more hands I could think of that fit in this bucket the more inclined I am to Bluff this sort of perspective switching can be particularly useful for people that may have a negative mindset or are not very confident when playing like most beginners and in the case of a perceived thin value spot like the one Magnus thought he was facing here instead of focusing on the potential traps in villains range such as Queens king queen nines and King Nine you could focus on the weaker hands that may have played this way that can Bluff catch such as perhaps Ace queen king X or pocket Jacks the greater number of weaker hands you could think of the more confident you'll be to fire the value bet so overall an interesting hand that just goes to show no matter how smart you are you could be one of the greatest strategic Minds that has ever lived poker is just so immeasurably complex that trying to reason or Intuit your way to Optimal decisions can be extremely difficult without a significant amount of experience or study that gives you a solid foundation to Anchor your decisions too so that is a video for today thanks for watching and until next time stay balanced [Music] [Applause] [Music]
