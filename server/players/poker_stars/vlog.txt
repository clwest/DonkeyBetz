[Document(page_content="Hello, welcome to PokerStars Learn. I'm James Hartigan and this is\nthe only 'How to Play Poker... for Beginners' guide you need to\n start your poker journey. After watching this video, you will know the basics and be\nable to play your first hand of poker. And if you want to learn more, please\n don't forget to subscribe to our channel. So, when we talk about poker, the\nmost popular version of the game - which you see in movies, on TV, and\non live streams - is No Limit Texas Hold'em, and that's what we are going to\nlearn to play in this video. The aim of Texas Hold'em is simple:\nmake the best five-card poker hand... from the two cards you've been dealt \nand the five shared cards... in the middle of the table. Or act like you have the best\n five-card hand! So what beats what? Well, let's run\n through the official hand rankings, starting at the bottom\n and work your way to the top. The worst you can have is a high\ncard. No two cards are the same, and the five cards don't connect\n in any other way. Ideally, you'd like to have at least\none pair: two cards of the same value. Aces are the highest pair. A pair of twos\n is the lowest. Two pair is better. Pretty self-explanatory. In this example, a pair of Kings \nand a pair of Sixes. Three-of-a-kind is also pretty \nself-explanatory, and it beats two pair. Next up, a straight: Five cards\n in a row of different suits. An ace can be high or low but\nno wraparounds are allowed. Queen-King-Ace-Two-Three\n is not a hand! Then a flush: Five cards of the\nsame suit, doesn't matter what... order they're in. A full house  - also known as a boat -\nIt's where you have three-of-a-kind plus a pair, That is a very strong hand, but it's\nstill beaten by quads, officially known as four-of-a-kind. A straight flush is an incredibly\nrare hand. Five cards in a row, all of the \nsame suit. And the Royal Flush is unbeatable.\n It's a straight flush - Ten to the Ace. Please note your chances of being\ndealt this hand are roughly 30,000 to 1! And those are the hand rankings.\nTo recap: It goes high card, one pair, two pair, three-of-a-kind,\n a straight, a flush, a full house, four-of-a-kind, straight flush, \nand the Royal Flush. There's also a downloadable hand\nrankings guide in the description. This is really useful to have by\nyour side for easy reference, when you're starting to play the\ngame. So, how does a hand of \npoker play out? Let's start with three important\npositions at the table... The button, sometimes referred to\nas the dealer button, and to their immediate left, the small \nblind and the big blind. Before any cards are dealt,\nthey have to put chips in, they are... literally forced to bet blind. \nHence, the name. the player in the big blind posts\nthe current minimum bet, with the player in the small blind -\n to their right - posting half that amount. The cards will then be dealt in\na clockwise order, starting with... the player to the left of the button.\nNow, if you play online or at a casino, you won't have to worry about dealing. But if your playing privately with\nfriends, it's standard for the... player with the dealer button to\nactually deal the hand. Once everyone has been dealt two\ncards, known as their 'hole cards,' it's time for the first betting\nround. Now, because the players in the \nsmall blind and big blind have.... already been forced to bet, the action\n starts with the player to their left. This player has a decision to make\nbased on the two cards they've been dealt. They can fold and wait for the\nnext hand, but if they want to stay in, they\ncan 'call', in other words, match... the amount of the big blind, or they can raise and \nset a new bet... that every other player has to\nmatch. The minimum raise is double the\nbig blind. And the maximum? Well, it depends on the \ntype of game, but if you're playing No Limit,\nthere isn't a maximum! At any point a player can go \n'all in' and bet everything... in front of them. If a player raises and everybody\nelse folds, the hand is over. But for the sake of argument, let's\nassume someone raises and... one or more players match\n this bet. That means we move to the next\nround and we get to see the 'flop:' three cards dealt face-up in the\nmiddle of the table. These are often referred to as\ncommunity cards, because... they are shared by all the players. So, everyone now has a five-card poker\nhand with more cards... still to come. We then have the second\n betting round. The action starts with the first\nactive player to the left of the dealer. And because there are no longer\nany forced bets, this player doesn't... have to put chips into the pot.\nThey can check for free. This means the action passes to\nthe next player... who can also check or bet. Let's recap the basic actions in\na round of betting. 'Check' means I'm not betting,\nbut I'm staying in the hand. I'm passing the action along to\nthe next player and I will react... to whatever they decide to do. 'Bet' means I'm putting chips into\nthe pot. 'Call' means I'm matching the bet. 'Raise' means I'm increasing \nthe size of the bet. And 'fold' means I don't want \nto call the bet. I'm throwing my hand away and \nsurrendering the pot. Remember, you can't check \nonce there's a bet in front of you. If you're not willing to commit\nany more chips, you have to fold. So, if we make it to the end of\nthe second betting round with... at least two players still in, another\ncard is dealt face-up... in the middle of the table. This is called the 'turn.' Each player now has six cards to\n choose from when trying... to make a good five-card \npoker hand. There's then another round of\n betting before the 'river' card... is dealt face-up next to the \nflop and turn. Now everyone has seven cards \navailable to them. Remember the aim of the game is\nto make the best five-card hand. This could be a combination of\ntwo hole cards and three... community cards, one plus four, \nor it could be the five cards... in the middle of the table. This is known as playing the board. After one final betting round,\nonce all the bets are matched, it's time for 'showdown.' This is where you finally show\nyour hand. And if it's better than everyone\nelse's, you win all the chips in the pot. Once a hand is over, the dealer button\nis moved one spot to the left, meaning the small blind and \nbig blind positions also rotate... clockwise, and the next hand begins. And you start again. So, now you know how a hand \nof poker works. I'm James Hartigan, and this\n has been the guide on... 'How to Play Poker for Beginners’\n from PokerStars.

[Document(page_content="Hello, I'm James Hartigan. \nWelcome to PokerStars Learn, and our guide to 'Betting and \nRaising in Texas Hold'em.' Betting in a poker hand is any \naction where you put chips into the pot. By the end of this video, you will \nknow the basics of why, when, and how much to bet. There are three different ways you\n can put chips into the pot: Making the initial bet, calling\n that bet, or raising it. This video is going to focus on\nthe more active or aggressive options: Betting and raising. If you want to learn more about\npoker, please don't forget... to subscribe to this channel. Okay, let's start by going over\nthe basics of betting... If nobody else has entered the\npot, then you can bet first. That could be the minimum - the \ncurrent value of the big blind - or more. If another player has already bet,\nthen you can add... the same number of chips to call,\nor you can raise. The minimum raise will be\n double the size of the current bet, but you can make it more. So why put in a bet? Broadly speaking,\nthere are two primary reasons: the first is to bet for value, \nthe second is to bet as a bluff. If you think you’ve got the best hand,\n you want to build a pot, and therefore win more chips. This type of bet is called\n a 'value bet.' You’re betting hoping to get called\n by an opponent with a worse hand. But you can't always rely on having\nthe best hand to win, though. The other reason to bet is when\nyou know you don't have the best hand. You want to make your opponent\nthink that you do, you want them to fold. This type of bet is famously \nknown as a bluff. It's the opposite of a value bet. You're betting hoping to get\nyour opponent to fold a better hand. While bluffing is central to poker, \nit's only part of the game. You should be very selective, \nonly bluffing when you're confident... it will work. For example, against tight,\n risk-averse players, and preferably when your hand still\nhas a chance of improving... on the turn or river. So, now you know why\n you want to bet, let's walk through the different\nbetting round in a hand of Hold'em. You can't be first into the pot\nbefore the flop, because the.. players in the small blind and the \nbig blind will have already.. posted the first bets. So here, you're going to be raising. The question is: How much to raise? Well, it's best to stick to a standard\n raise size for all of your hands - somewhere between two big blinds \nand three big blinds - you don't want to give away the\nstrength of the cards you're holding. What you must not do is bet based\n on the value of your hole cards. For example, don't raise less\n with King-Queen suited... than you would with Aces. If you reveal these hands at showdown\nafter the last betting round, your opponents will immediately\nmake the connection... and they'll use that information \nagainst you in later rounds. 3-betting is the more common\nname for re-raising before the flop. It means to put in the third bet.\nThink of it this way. The big blind is the first bet, the initial raise is the second\nbet, and the re-raise is the 3-bet. You'll also hear about 4-betting \nand 5-betting, which... is re-re-raising and\n re-re-re-raising. And now you know why it's easier\n to use numbers. Obviously, you can re-raise for\n value or as a bluff. So, if a player at the table calls\n your raise - or re-raise - you're now going to see a flop. And as the preflop aggressor,\nthe last person to raise, you're  expected to make a \ncontinuation bet. Continuation betting, commonly\nknown as C-betting is where the... player who made the final raise\nin the previous betting round... is the first player to bet\nin the next round. Players often check to the aggressor,\nexpecting them to bet. C-betting for value works because\n if you connect with the flop, or you think you still have the \nbest hand, it's time to build that pot. C-betting as a bluff also works because\n even if you haven't connected... with the board, \nyou can pretend you have. Let's say there's an Ace on the\nflop and you don't have an Ace. You can bet here, hoping to convince\n your opponent you do have it. Remember: you raised before the\nflop, and a lot of the hands you're... likely to have done this with \ninclude an Ace. But you shouldn't be mindlessly \nC-bet bluffing on every single flop. The best times to do it are when\nthere are no obvious draws, and when there are very few players\ninvolved in the pot. It's worth highlighting it isn't compulsory\n to C-bet and checking is not off-limits. Now, let's switch things around. If you're the player who called\nthe original raise, you can take... the initiative to bet first after the flop\n rather than checking to the aggressor. This is called 'donk-betting' because\ninexperienced players... might do it without thinking. But that \ndoesn't mean it's a bad thing. In situations where there are multiple\n players in the pot, and several big draws are possible,\nthe pre-flop raiser might just check back. There are situations where \ndonk-betting can be effective: denying free cards and making\n your opponent pay to continue. As always, you can do this for value\n or you can do it as a bluff... if you think your opponents \nare likely to fold. Even more exciting and threatening,\nhowever, is the check-raise - Checking when the action's on you \nonly to raise after a player... behind you has bet. This completely shakes up\n the order of things and strikes... fear into the C-betting player,\nwho might have been caught bluffing. Now you know about \nvarious betting tactics, you'll want to know about sizing\nyour post-flop bets. And as is so often the case, it\ncomes down to position, community cards, and the other players \nat the table. But here are a few general guidelines... On a dry board with few, if any, draws\n possible, you don't have to bet very big at all. Because your opponent either \nhas it or they don't. 25% to 30% of what's already in the\n middle is fine here. If your opponent calls, there's a reasonable\n chance they've connected with the board. You can use that information:\n whether it means continuing to... bet for value or putting the\n brakes on your bluffing plans. On a wet board, with draws aplenty, \nyou might not be betting to bluff at all. But where you have the best hand\nand want to keep it that way, you should be betting more. If there's a possible straight\ndraw, 50% of the pot or a little over... that amount will be a good \nvalue bet. On a very wet board with straights\nand flushes in view, that should creep up to 75% or 80%. Against players you know to\n be weak, who don't have any real \nunderstanding of odds, you can opt to bump up those bets\n to 90 or even 100% of the pot... to get even more value. So, those are the basics of betting\nand raising from PokerStars. Don't forget to give us a like,\nand subscribe for more poker videos.

[Document(page_content="Hello, welcome to PokerStars Learn. I'm James Hartigan, and this is a beginner's \nguide to 'Texas Hold'em Starting Hands.' Every hand of poker begins with\n each player being dealt two cards: Your hole cards,\nAKA your starting hand. But whether you should play those\ncards, depends on a... combination of things. In this video, I will break down\n starting hands into different categories, and offer some advice on the types of \nhands you should be playing, while also explaining how your position \nat the table and the players you're... competing against might impact\n your decision. Don't forget: for more poker tutorials\nand the best poker content on YouTube, hit the subscribe button. So, how do you decide whether to\nplay the two cards you've been dealt? Well, it's all about the strength \nof these cards. This will determine whether you\nshould be getting involved and... putting any chips into the pot. Yes, there are more cards to be revealed \nwhich will change things, but here is a hashtag #FunFact. A strong starting hand will win against\na weaker one three times out of four. And when you're beginning\n your poker journey... a really solid strategy is to focus\non just playing strong hands. So, what are you looking for? The best starting hands are the 'Monsters.'\nBig pairs: Aces, Kings, and Queens, plus Ace-King. Very good hands are Jacks, Tens, \nand Nines, plus Ace-Queen, Ace-Jack, Ace-Ten, and King-Queen. All other pairs are decent. \nAs are suited Aces. For example, Ace-Five of clubs. Other hands that fall into the decent\ncategory include combinations of high cards, like King-Jack, Queen-Jack, \nand Jack 10 plus so-called suited connectors. For example, Six-Five of diamonds \nand Eight-Seven of spades. With this type of starting hand, You have the chance to make a straight\nor a flush, or even a straight flush... but probably only if you're James Bond. There are some situations where\nyou might find yourself playing.... 'Speculative' hands: non-suited connectors, \nfor example, Ten-Nine, or not quite connected cards:\none-gappers like Ten-Eight of hearts. But pretty much everything\nelse falls into the trash category. They're really not playable at\nall in Hold'em. So fold them. The worst starting hand is \nSeven-Two off-suit. It doesn't have a realistic chance\nof making a straight or a... ...flush and neither card is high. Okay. We've sorted the good\n from the bad. However, it's important to \nremember your position at the table... massively influences which \nhand you should be playing. As a rule of thumb, the more players\nstill to act the better... your starting hand needs to be,\nbecause there's a higher chance... of someone behind you having a\nmonster. So generally speaking, stick to\nplaying really strong hands in... early position where you're\none of the first players to act, and save the decent and speculative\nhands for when you're in late position. When you're one of the last players\nto act and you've seen what... your opponents have decided to do. It's important to observe the table\nyou're at and adjust accordingly. Really tight tables where players\nwait for premium cards, and therefore play fewer hands\nare going to allow you to... play a little looser, \nopen up your game, maybe even giving you the\n opportunity to raise with... small pairs and connectors \nin early position. Tight players are likely to fold your\nraises a lot of the time, allowing you to steal lots of small\npots. But on the flip side, to win a really loose table like\n the ones often found at... lower stakes, you'll need to play tighter, waiting for strong hands\nand raising in late position. Loose players get involved\n in too many hands. You can exploit this with patience. Eventually your monster will blow\ntheir trash out of the water. You will find a link below to download\nsome charts. They'll help you understand \nwhich starting hands... you should be playing from which\nposition. Major caveat: \nThis is purely a recommendation, not a guaranteed recipe for success. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this video \non starting hands from PokerStars.

[Document(page_content="Hello welcome to PokerStars Learn. I'm James Hartigan and this is\nthe beginner's guide to... 'Bluffing in Texas Hold'em.' This video will explain why bluffing\nis such an important part of poker. Plus, I'll give you five top tips\non how to bluff. For more poker tutorials and the\n best poker content on YouTube... don't forget to hit the \nsubscribe button. Now, I'm sure you know what \n'bluffing' is. Chances are, you heard the expression\n used in a non poker context... before you even knew\n about poker! Bluffing at the poker table is\nall about deception. It's when you convince your \nopponent your hand is strong... when it's actually weak. The aim is to make them fold \na better hand, so you can win all the chips in\nthe pot! Without bluffing poker would be\npretty boring. Bets would be made, the best hand would win, and the\ncards would even out... in the long run. Yawn. So, now you know why\n bluffing is important, let's talk about how you're going\nto bluff at the table. And here is our first tip. Make sure you play your normal\ngame. In other words, play... exactly the same way you would\nif you actually had a strong hand. If you start varying your bet sizes -\n for example, betting a lot more... when you don't have the goods -\nyour opponents... are going to spot this. This extends to body language\n in live poker too. If you're usually quiet at the table\n and then start acting like a... motor-mouth when you're bluffing,\nyou're going to make... other players suspicious. Indicating something about the\n strength of your hand by the way... you act is known as a 'tell,' because\n you're unconsciously telling... your opponent's about\n your cards. Good players won't give off \nany tells, but weaker players might \nbet differently, or act differently when they're\nbluffing. So make sure you watch\n out for this. Tip number two: choose the \nright opponents to bluff. Don't start bluffing players at random,\n study your opponents first. Imagine there's someone at the\n table who hasn't played... a hand for half an hour. A player like this is clearly very tight,\n and is commonly referred... to in poker as an 'nit.' If they suddenly start betting \nand raising, they obviously... have something really good, so \nit would be unwise to try bluffing them. They probably won't fold. On the flip side, a player who \ngets involved in way too many... hands is known as a 'calling station.'\nDon't bluff this person either! Most of the time they're not folding, \neven if they have less than stellar cards. This type of player is extremely\ncommon at the lowest stakes. So, if you're just starting out in poker, \nplease be aware that bluffing... will rarely work at this level. That being said, one type of player\nyou'll come across at the lower levels... who you should bluff against \nis the 'over-folder.' For example, players in the big blind\n who only call raises... with really strong hands. A player like this is way too believing\nof their opponents, and can be exploited. Tip number three: Choose the right\ntime to bluff. Bluffing against a bunch of\n players is rarely going to work. Why? Because, chances are, one of them\nhas something. Your best opportunity to bluff\nis when you have fewer players... to convince. For this reason, it's very common for players \nto raise from the button with weak hands, either to steal the blinds, or have\nthe advantage of position... in future betting rounds, where the \nother players have to act first. Generally, you should bluff more at\nthe start of a hand than at the end. With cards still to come, you still have\n the opportunity to improve. Bluffing with a draw - for example,\n four cards to a straight, or three cards to a flush -  is known\nas semi-bluffing. You're half bluffing and half hoping \nto catch the right cards and make... the best hand. On the later betting rounds, you \nshould consider curbing your aggression. As the pot gets bigger, your opponent has\n more incentive to call, even with a hand that isn't that strong. This leads us to our next tip. Don't be afraid to get caught bluffing\nonce in a while. Earlier in this video, I mentioned that\n players who don't bluff are easy to play against. Showing the rest of the table that\nyou are capable of bluffing, makes you less predictable to\n your opponents. The key is not to feel embarrassed.\nOkay, your bluff didn't work. You got caught in the act, but it's \nnormal, it's an accepted part of the game. Just move past it and look\n to the next hand. Finally, learn how to manage\n your bluffing. If you feel like you're not bluffing\noften enough; If you find that you're not getting\nany callers when you raise, try buffing a little bit more. And if you're bluffing regularly, and\n keep getting caught by players... with average hands, you're probably \nbluffing too much. Just be careful trying to copy \nwhat you see on TV. There are many famous bluffs \ninvolving skilled players... in high-stakes games. But as I mentioned earlier, low stakes \ngames will be less 'bluffable'. So dial it down when playing cash\n games or tournaments... with a smaller buy-in. Please remember, bluffing isn't something you have\nto master before you start playing. At the start of your poker journey, it won't\n be the most crucial part of your game, and should definitely come second\n to a strategy of... playing strong starting hands.

If you play online or at a casino,\nyou don\'t have to worry about dealing, but if you\'re playing privately\nwith friends, it\'s customary... that the player with the Dealer\nButton actually deals the hand. Take the deck of cards and shuffle\nthem all facedown. Any good shuffle is okay, assuming it mixes up the deck and\nnobody sees any of the cards. Then, cut the deck in two and move\nthe lower half to the top. This is known as cutting the cards. It\'s an added security measure\nto prevent anyone from manipulating... the cards while shuffling them. Next, deal to the player to the immediate \nleft of the button - the small blind - and then work in a clockwise direction,\nending with yourself. Continue dealing until you\'ve dealt\ntwo cards facedown to every player. We then have the pre-flop betting\nround. Couple of notes... In a tournament, a player has to be\n at their seat when the... last card is dealt to take part \n in the hand; Hole cards are dealt to every position\n at the table regardless, but if a player hasn\'t taken their\nseat before the last card is dealt, the hand is automatically \nmucked, or folded; In a cash game, a player won\'t\n be dealt any cards... if they\'re not at the table. After the first betting round is\ncomplete, you\'re going to deal the flop. To do this, simply discard the card\n on the top of the deck. Then deal the next three cards\nface-up in the middle of the table. Why discard that top card? \'Burning\' a card prevents any players\n knowing what\'s coming next, in the unlikely event that the card on the top\n of the deck has become marked. It helps protect the integrity\n of the game. When dealing the turn, you also \nburn a card before dealing... one card face-up to the right \nof the flop. And same again with the river. Burn a card and deal the final \ncommunity card... face-up to the right of the turn\ncard. So, that\'s the basics of dealing. Now, let\'s talk about how to\n handle your hole cards. First, it\'s important you don\'t show\n them to anyone else... while the hand is in progress. \nYour hole cards are private. Shield them when you look at them \nto prevent the players either... side of you, or anyone standing \nbehind you, from seeing them. Players usually peel the corners \nof their cards up with one hand... and shield with the other. You can look at your hand at any\ntime, or you don\'t have to look at all, but you probably should. Second, while playing a hand \nit\'s good practice to protect... your hole cards from being \naccidentally mucked by the dealer, by keeping them close to you, and\neither resting your hand on... the cards or putting a single chip\non top of them. If your hole cards are too far forward, \nthe dealer may think you folded, and sweep your cards into the muck. If this happens, it\'s considered to\n be your mistake. It\'s highly unlikely you\'ll get your hole\n cards back and you\'ll be out of the hand. Finally, when protecting your cards\ndon\'t hide them from view. For example, don\'t place your \nchips in front of them. This might confuse the players\nand the dealer about whether... you\'re still in the hand. It could even be viewed as \nan underhand tactic: A way of trying to stay in the\nhand without betting, and moves like this are referred\n to as \'angle shooting.\' Another thing to mention is that\nif you\'re folding, you can\'t... just show one player your hole\ncards. Casinos generally employ a \n\'show one, show all\' policy... in the interest of fairness for\n all players. Finally, after you folded don\'t announce\n your cards to anyone... while there\'s still a hand in progress. Imagine a situation where you make\na trivial fold with Jack-Three, and the flop comes Jack-Three-Three. You might be frustrated or amused\nby the situation, but keep it to yourself. If you\'re not in the hand you shouldn\'t\ndo or say anything... that might influence play. Let\'s talk about the times when\nyou will be showing your hole cards. In our \'How to Play Poker\' video, \nwe explained how players will... reveal their cards at showdown,\nafter the final betting round. The player whose bet has been called, \nthe aggressor, is expected to show first. In a live game, the second player\n doesn\'t have to show... if they can\'t beat their \nopponent\'s hand. If there was no bet on the river,\nthe player to the left of the... dealer shows first, and then it\ngoes in order clockwise. There is one exception to this. If you have an unbeatable hand,\nknown in poker as the \'nuts,\' or the near nuts, you shouldn\'t wait. This is known as slow-rolling, and\nis poor etiquette towards... your fellow players. \nShow both cards immediately. Now, if there\'s a player who\'s gone\nall-in earlier in the hand... and another player has called, providing\nthere\'s no one else involved, both players turn the hole cards \nface-up before any remaining... community cards are dealt. One word of advice. If you\'re involved in an all-in\nsituation, don\'t reveal your cards too early. Please wait for the dealer to confirm\nthat the action has closed, and there are no more bets. If you\'re too quick, you could lose some calls, or worse, gain some calls \nfrom dominating hands. Right, let\'s move on from\n cards to chips. For as long as you\'re playing at\nthe table you will have a stack of chips in front of you. You might see players shuffling\nor riffling their chips, but... chips must stay on the table\nat all times for everyone to see. Players need to make decisions\nbased on how many chips their... opponents have. A couple of notes related to this. You must make sure your higher-value\nchips are visible. For example, if you had a stack of 1000s\n behind a stack of 25s, it could be judged that you \nwere intentionally... trying to hide them to trick players, and you could receive a penalty. For the benefit of the dealer and\n other players, it\'s good... practice to keep your chips in\ncountable stacks. Ideally, level stacks of 20, with\n your highest value chips at the front. As a tournament progresses\n and the blinds increase, low value chips are removed from play\n when they\'re no longer needed. The dealer organizes this and replaces\nthem with higher value chips. For example, four 25s can \nbe traded for one 100. This is called coloring up. In a situation where there are \nodd chips - for example, four players at the\n table each have a single 25 - the dealer will run a chip race. They will deal a single card to\nthese four players with the... highest card earning the 100 chip. This isn\'t going to impact your\ntournament life at all, but it... does explain where your single\ngreen chip went while you... were on break. When it comes to betting your chips, you must be aware of string-betting\nand avoid doing it. String-betting is making a single bet\nin several actions. A classic example is the movie cliché... where the villain says\n"I call your 1,000," - throws a 1,000 chip - "and I raise you 5,000." This doesn\'t happen in real life.\nIt\'s actually against the rules. You must put your bet forward in\na single motion. Alternatively, you can verbally announce \nyour bet. That becomes binding. So you can say "Raise 5,000,"\n and then you can take your time... counting out your chips and putting\nthem out one at a time. One time when it\'s really important\n to announce your bet... is when you are raising with one chip. In a casino, throwing one chip into\nthe middle without saying... anything is always a call. Inexperienced players are often caught \nout by this when they\'re trying... to raise with a single chip but fail to\n verbally announce it. This rule applies for both larger \nand smaller chips. If there\'s a bet of 100 and you\nput in a 500 chip, it\'s a call of a 100. If you put in a 25 chip\nby mistake, it\'s still a call of 100. And if you place two or more chips\n into the pot in a single motion... without saying anything you are likely \nto be held to a raise. Here\'s an example. \nYour opponent bets 225. You want to call but you don\'t\n have any 100 chips. You want to make life easy for\nthe dealer, so you put in a 1000 chip and a\n25, so you can get 800 in change. Unless you say the word call before\nputting in those chips... It could be ruled that you have\nraised to 1,025. Ultimately, it\'s good practice \nto announce all your bets clearly, while you’re getting comfortable with \nhandling chips, and to keep your chips in clear view \nand easily countable. In the next section, we\'re going to\n cover the general etiquette... of players at the table. First of all, you should always be respectful\nof your fellow players and the dealer. Players who don\'t will receive\n a warning and may be... asked to leave the casino. If you\'re in a multi-way pot -a hand... with three or more players - then\nyou can\'t say anything that could... be seen to influence the actions\nof the other players. This is relaxed when only two players\n are in the hand, at which point... those players are free to say almost\nanything they like. Another issue is when players \nact out of turn. A lot of the times it\'s done by mistake,\nwhen players aren\'t paying attention. But it\'s considered unsporting and \ndisrespectful, and can result in... players being penalized. \nJust wait for your turn. Using a phone at the table during\na hand is forbidden in a casino. You\'re also not allowed to take\na phone call at the table, whether... you\'re in a hand or not. You shouldn\'t have your phone on \nthe surface of the table either. In fact, there shouldn\'t be... anything on the playing surface\nother than your chips and cards. As for listening to music, that\'s\nokay, as long as you use headphones. Just make sure you can still keep\ntrack of what\'s happening at the table. You can also wear a hood, wear\na hat, wear sunglasses. All fine. Finally, you can take your time when playing\na hand within reason. In tournaments, the blind levels \nincrease at regular intervals. So taking 15 minutes over a decision\nin a game with 20 minute... blind levels will agitate other players. Players may \'call the clock\' and\nask the tournament director to put... a time limit on your decision. Also, many tournaments now play with \na shot clock giving players a fixed amount... of time for each action on\n each betting street. The most important takeaway from this\n is to be respectful and be alert. So, now you know the general \nrules of playing poker, and you\'re ready for your game. I\'m James Hartigan.

bets themselves blind level is a section of a tournament where the blinds are fixed at specific amounts steal the blinds this is where a player bets pre-flop not wanting to be called they just want to take the chips contributed by the two players who've posted the blinds defend the blinds means not folding from either the small blind or big blind position when there's been a raise before the flop blinding out occurs when a player isn't playing any hands but is losing a lot of chips simply by posting the blinds each orbit this could be because they're being dealt particularly bad cards or it could be they're away from the table for an extended period of time a walk is when the player in the big blind wins the pop without having to do anything because every other player at the table folds pre-flop street is used to describe each stage of a hand where there's a round of betting following the dealing of a specific card or cards these streets are pre-flop this is after the whole cards

and river can be used as verbs when you make a hand on a particular street for example i flopped a straight or i rivered a flush showdown this isn't a betting street it's when players show their hull cards at the end of a hand to determine who's won muck is when a player doesn't reveal their cards at showdown and accepts defeat they pass their cards back to the dealer face down signaling they can't beat their opponent's hand action refers to the decision a player takes on each betting street bet means to put chips into the pot specifically when it's the first player to do so raise this

player bets or raises all their remaining chips also known as shoving pushing or jamming a three bet is a re-raise it's where a player raises after there's been an initial bet and a raise it's

wants to build a pot and win ships and bets hoping to get caught by an opponent with a worse hand bluff means betting with a poor hand with the sole intention of making other players fold better hands a semi-bluff is basically bluffing with a draw it's betting with a hand that doesn't have much value yet for example four cards to a flush but has potential and could improve to something really
